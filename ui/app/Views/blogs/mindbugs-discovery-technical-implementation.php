                            In the last year, we, as humanity, have created the technology to pass the Turing test.
                            If one is optimistic, is possible to say that humans and machines have the same capacity
                            of writing quality content, but if you take a more realistic approach, machines
                            are better. Despite the big advancements with both their threats and opportunities,
                            we still do not understand how deep learning works. It can be said that we created
                            the alien technology that we feared for so long: it surpasses us in terms of intelligence
                            (defined as the ability to solve tasks) and understands and exploits us, but
                            humans can not understand it.
                        </p>

                    <div class="entry-content mt-0">
                        <p>
                            In the context of this new technology, a flood of text AI bots could mean the
                            end of democracy, a flood of generated art could mean the end of knowing human
                            creativity and a flood of generated music could mean the end of understanding
                            someone’s feeling but an exploitation of what we like. We already witnessed
                            increased problems due to the recommendation algorithms of social media, which
                            influenced the ability to learn and focus on millions of people. I strongly
                            believe that at this point we can not imagine the implications and effects of the new
                            technology on humans.

                            As Frank Herbert said, the reformers have always caused more damage
                            than any other force in human history, when they try to completely change the
                            course of things. On the contrary, one should focus on finding the natural course
                            of things, follow its trajectory, and influence it in a positive way. In this line, the
                            powerful new AI technology is here to stay, and despite the threats, we need to use
                            it, understand it, and create a better world.

                        <p>
                            In contradiction with the concerned beginning, I strongly believe that AI could
                            be the best and most interesting technology developed by humans so far. It is the
                            most advanced intelligence we created to solve different kinds of problems. It is
                            used not only to empower individuals but also to reduce suffering in key areas
                            where human intelligence seems to reach its limitation or move too slowly. It can
                            already improve day-to-day life in a meaningful way, accelerate the development of drugs, create simulations for cancer patients with different types of treatment and
                            the list gets longer and longer.

                            In this line of thought the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) is growing. How
                            can we create systems that use the power of deep learning, while also allowing
                            humans to understand most behind the scenes and influence their behavior? These
                            kinds of systems are important in order to expand the current use of deep learning
                            to critical areas such as journalism or medicine while keeping the responsibility and
                            decision on the human side. One of these initiatives is the tool presented in the
                            following pages: MindBugs Discovery, a tool for fact-checking journalists.

                            The MindBugs Discovery aims to create an interactive environment for visualizing
                            the hidden structure of misinformation. In a world where reality and fiction
                            merge, a scalable system with verified information is beginning to be a necessity.
                            The tool is designed for journalists to help them ease their work and also for the
                            general public who has the curiosity of looking into disinformation techniques and
                            propaganda. It is an initiative that wants to gather the sparse work of fact-checking
                            organizations into a single place, in order to help people understand and easily identify
                            the fake information which they encounter. It is a centralized space and a search
                            engine, where the work and knowledge of human specialists are provided.
