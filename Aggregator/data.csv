Propaganda: Ukrainians want a determined president, like Vladimir Putin, and not puppets of the West
NEWS: ""The official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zakharova, said that the Ukrainian people want a president like the Russian leader Vladimir Putin, that's why the Ukrainians are so aggressive towards him"", according to an interview given to RT.
""The tragedy of the Ukrainian people is the following: Ukrainians want a president like Putin, but every time they choose a character appointed by the West,"" Maria Zakharova declared.
She also added that Ukraine needs such an ""open, determined and informed president"", who does not have speeches read from a sheet of paper sent by Washington. The representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the attitude against Putin in Ukraine is explained by psychologist Freud's theories"".
NARRATIVE: Ukrainians want a president like Vladimir Putin
Reality: For Ukrainians, Putin is a new Hitler
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the level of hatred of Ukrainian citizens towards Russian leader Vladimir Putin has been increasing since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the launch of military actions in Donbass. After the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is seen as a symbol of the robberies and atrocities committed by the Russian army. Putin is not considered in Ukraine an ""open and determined"" president, as Maria Zakharova claims, but a terrorist and criminal who is no different from the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.
According to a survey carried out at the beginning of this year, 94% of Ukrainians believe that Vladimir Putin is an Adolf Hitler of the 21st century. Hatred of Vladimir Putin is present in all Ukrainian regions, regardless of whether they are inhabited by Russian speakers or Ukrainian speakers.
The level of hatred towards Vladimir Putin, seen in Ukraine as an international criminal and terrorist, has been increasing since 2014. At that time, 41% of Ukrainians (especially young people and pensioners) declared that they hated the Russian president because betrayed the Ukrainian state and attacked it. After the launch of the large-scale invasion against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the level of hatred increased even more. According to the latest polls, 98 percent of Ukrainians have a negative attitude towards Vladimir Putin.
Maria Zaharova's words are broken from reality. In fact, the spokeswoman of the Russian MFA tried to explain the phenomenon of Ukrainians' hatred of Putin by their desire to have such a president, emphasizing that this attitude is explained by the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud. The Ukrainians would have hated Putin because they would like to have such a leader, and not one appointed by the West, says Zakharova.
The Kremlin needs Freud to understand democracy
In Ukraine, the president is elected in a national election, monitored by observers from all over the world. After the protests in Kiev in 2014, called Euromaidan, Petro Poroshenko was elected president. In 2019, he was defeated in the elections by Volodymyr Zelensky. The presidents in Ukraine are not appointed by the West, but elected by the citizens. In Russia, elections do not matter, and the opposition is persecuted and silenced.
Vladimir Putin illegally changed the national legislation several times in order to stay in power, also achieving a short-lived ring with former Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. In 2024, there will be presidential elections in Russia, and Putin, following the introduction of some amendments to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, can remain in power until 2036. Since 2000, Vladimir Putin has monopolized political life in Russia, destroying pluralism, the elements civil society and freedom of expression.
In March this year The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant in the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin leader is accused of war crimes on the territory of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the attitude of Ukrainians towards Russia. According to Russian propaganda, the mothers and wives of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat are protesting the war, while the armed conflict in Ukraine is a civil war because Russians and Ukrainians are one people. The Russian press wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: The EU allows Ukraine to violate the rights of Russian speakers
Reality: Ukraine must modernize its legislation in the field of the rights of national minorities in order to join the EU
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media distorted the content and context of an interview given by the vice president of the Supreme Rada of Ukraine, Olena Kondratiuk, to the Telegraf publication, emphasizing that the EU would agree with Kiev's violation of the rights of Russian speakers. According to the pro-Kremlin media, the subject of the rights of national minorities in Ukraine was a central one in the Kiev-Brussels talks, and the Ukrainian politicians would have convinced the European officials of the need to continue the talks on accession despite the repeated discrimination of the Russian-speaking community.
In reality, we do not find in that interview any information about the EU agreement to discriminate against Russian speakers in Ukraine. Also, Olena Kondratiuk did not say that the topic of the Russian-speaking minority was central during the negotiations with Brussels. The vice-president of the Kyiv Parliament spoke more about the media law, justice reform and the measures taken by Ukraine to reduce the influence of oligarchs on society. Among other things, the law of national minorities was also mentioned, emphasizing the fact that the Venice Commission has a series of claims against it that must be taken into account. She also mentioned the claims that Budapest has regarding the new legislation in this field, adding that Ukrainian diplomats request the postponement of the examination of this sensitive file for a period after the end of the hostilities.
In this context, the EU cannot agree to any kind of national, racial or linguistic discrimination. Through this false narrative, created after distorting the context of the original news, the pro-Kremlin press wants to generate anti-European attitudes among Russian speakers in the post-Soviet space. In reality, according to the accession criteria, known as the Copenhagen Criteria, the states that propose to join the EU must ensure the stability of the institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights, as well as the respect and protection of minorities. It is a fundamental principle of the EU, which cannot be omitted in the case of Ukraine or any other state. In this sense, the opinion of the Venice Commission matters for the EU during the analysis of the files of the candidate states.
The Ukrainian side requests the EU to postpone an assessment of the progress of accession to this chapter, as a result of the aggression of the Russian Federation. In addition, the article published in the Ukrainian press did not talk much about the Russian minority, the subject being presented in this way only by pro-Kremlin propaganda.
Why it is not a ""cultural genocide""
In fact, Ukraine's initiatives starting in 2014 to limit the informational and cultural space of Russia's influence on society were categorized by Russian politicians as a genocide against Russian speakers. Kyiv introduced language quotas at radio and TV stations in order to develop music and shows in the Ukrainian language, and not to violate the rights of Russian speakers. In addition, the transition period provided for by the Education Law, against which both the Romanian and Hungarian minorities in Ukraine protested, was extended at the EU's request until the fall of 2024.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding Ukraine's ""hostile policy"" towards Russophones. The Russian press wrote that Russophobic foreigners will have the right to tear apart Crimea and Donbass after the liberation of these territories, while in Ukraine only Russophones from is because they want to exterminate them. According to Russian propaganda, Ukraine will organize a genocide of Russians and plans to kill 5000 people daily. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: Long periods of extreme heat are common in Romania.
CONTEXT: Global warming is the phenomenon of continuous increase in average recorded temperatures of the atmosphere in close proximity to the ground, as well as ocean water. The phenomenon is almost unanimously accepted by scientists and decision-makers, there are various explanations of its causes, but the dominant opinion is the one that claims that warming is due to human activity, especially through the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere resulting from burning of fossil fuels. Regardless of the cause, global warming has profound effects in the most different fields, from influencing people's health and even the extinction of some animal species, to extreme weather phenomena and the melting of glaciers that cause an increase in the level of the seas and oceans. As a result, the fight against the consequences of global warming and the climate changes caused by it represents one of the most important points of interest of mankind, both at the individual level and of various local and international organizations.
Although the effects of the increase in average global temperatures are more and more frequent and easy to observe, there is a climate denialism, manifested also through a true ""pandemic of misinformation"". The narrative of the evil goals of the world occult hidden behind the fight against changes climate change is not at all new; Veridica has dismantled several such fake news over time, such as those in which it is stated that the ecodictatorship will push humanity towards a feudal social system, or that people will have to pay to be able to breathe. In principle, the basis of these narratives is the fear that the fight against climate change will impoverish the population, who will not be able to afford the costs of producing ""green"" energy. There is also the fear that a strong campaign to combat the effects of global warming led by governments could disregard people's economic freedoms, and the state would become too powerful in relation to civil society. In recent years, the theme is also used by Russian propaganda, with the aim of diverting the attention of public opinion from the invasion of Ukraine and the expansionist policies of the Kremlin.
OBJECTIVE: Inciting civil disobedience and social revolt against the authorities, reducing and even stopping actions that affect economic interests and businesses from polluting activities, as well as promoting an anti-Western discourse.
Before it was neither better nor warmer
WHY THE STORY IS FALSE: The absolute temperature record measured in Romania is 44.5 degrees Celsius and was recorded on August 10, 1951, in Braila county, at the former Ion Sion weather station. However, over time, maximum annual temperatures of over 40 degrees were also measured in 1946, in Strehaia - 43.5 degrees, in 1950, in Jimbolia - 42.5, in 2007 in Calafat and Bechet - 44.3 and 44.2 degrees, even in 1896 in Giurgiu - 42.8 degrees. However, these peaks were exceptions and stretched over extremely short periods of time, of a few hours. For example, on August 10, 1951, the records kept in the archive of the National Meteorological Agency record at the Ion Sion station, 28 degrees Celsius at 8:00 a.m. and 31.4 degrees at 8:00 p.m., much lower than the maximum reached around 14:00.
Romania's climate has changed considerably compared to the 80s: heat waves last for weeks, precipitation is rarer and less quantitative, and extreme phenomena are multiplying. 40 years ago, temperatures rarely exceeded 35 degrees in the summer, and the snow and frost started as early as mid-December, if not earlier. The proof is also the fact that most cold records last 70-80 years ago, while many heat records were broken in the last 20. Statistics show that the average annual temperature in Romania increased by 2.41 degrees Celsius in the last 60 years. At the same time, for the period 2001-2030, compared to 1961-1990, the average annual warming is between 0.7 and 1.1 degrees. The average temperature in Romania in the 20th century was approximately 10.6 degrees, and after 2007, it increased to values ​​between 11.23 degrees in 2013 and 12.14 in 2019. According to official data, the warmest years in the last half of the century were, in ascending order, 2015, 2022, 2020 and 2019, and the coldest were 1976, 1980, 1993 and 1985, that is, precisely the period mentioned in the analyzed article.
In fact, without official data, measurements or statistics, the story is nothing more than a nostalgic account of childhood lived under communism, fueled by vague memories of warm summers. Moreover, the author of the material is not at her first ""deviation"", publishing over time several articles in which she evokes the period of her childhood in an idyllic and idealized note, in total contrast to that of contemporary times, loaded with capitalist consumerism and lack of authentic socialization among the little ones. In addition, we hope that inadvertently, the article contains small historical inaccuracies, such as the presence of soft drink dispensers in Romania in the 80s, or the water bottles that Romanians carried around them for cooling and hydration, a habit that entered Romanian life after 1990, with the appearance of plastic bottles in stores.
The most cynical remark still remains, ""Nobody died from too much sun"". Contrary to the not-so-expert opinion of the author of the article, heat affects human health as seriously as possible. In 2022 alone, over 15,000 people died in Europe due to heatwave, and Cluj-Napoca registered 32 deaths per hundred thousand inhabitants, caused by extreme heat, occupying the first position in a ranking that included 93 European cities.
In conclusion, the data related to global warming are more and more worrying about the climate future of the planet. In an analysis published by the BBC, the British station talks about a series of four climate records broken this year: July 6, 2023 was the hottest day of July ever measured based on the average temperature in the world, 17.08 degrees. We also had the hottest June ever recorded, with a record plus 1.47 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period. Another record is represented by the warming of the oceans, which exceeded the values ​​known for the months of May, June and July. In the North Atlantic, off the western coast of Ireland, June temperatures were 4-5 degrees above average. The fourth record is the reduction of the surface covered by ice in Antarctica, to a historic minimum for the month of July, specialists estimating that an area 10 times larger than that of Great Britain has disappeared compared to the average of the period 1981-2010.

NARRATIVE: Ukrainians are sentenced to prison for talking to their relatives in Russia
Reality: The Ukrainians who sent information to the Russian army regarding the deployment of critical and military infrastructure in Ukraine are being prosecuted
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Pro-Kremlin propaganda distorted a series of news stories in the Ukrainian media regarding the sentencing of a woman to 10 years in prison for sending photos of critical and military infrastructure targets to some people in Russia with the message that ""namely these "" should be bombed. She offered assistance to the Russian army regarding the location of these objectives, at the same time discrediting the Ukrainian army on social networks in the Russian Federation, where she had been registered for several years. On the same networks, the woman argued that Ukraine's borders should be renegotiated with Russia. In the context of the martial law in Ukraine, the woman's actions were categorized as state treason that determines the violation of territorial integrity by the Russian army.
According to local media, the woman admitted her guilt. In connection with this fact, the court reduced the initial sentence from 15 to 10 years in prison. During the court hearing, the woman declared that her actions were determined by emotions, nostalgia and various memories from the past.
The Russian press omitted this information, claiming that the woman was sentenced to 10 years in prison because she was in contact with her relatives in Russia. Also, according to Russian propaganda, the woman distributed critical messages about the 20th century Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, provoking the indignation of the ""fascist group"" in Kiev.
The court hearings were called by the Russian press ""public revenge of the Nazis"" and ""Ukrainian repressive hell"", without correctly mentioning the context of the event. It is worth mentioning that since the launch of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, there have been several cases of prosecution of Ukrainian citizens for collaborating with the occupation forces or the Russian secret services.
Russia is looking for new justifications for the continuation of the ""special military operation""
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this false narrative is to find new justifications for the continuation of the ""special military operation"". According to Russian propaganda, the ""repressive hell"" in Ukraine can only be stopped by the Russian soldier. It is worth mentioning that the information appeared in the Ukrainian press in the fall of 2022, being developed in the form of a propaganda narrative only in July 2023.
In this context, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian government press also wrote that Russia's peace plan is increasingly supported in the EU, while the UN accused Ukraine of torturing civilians. According to the Russian media, moral principles prevent Russia from ending the war. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""The authorities of the Republic of Moldova should understand that the country's approach to NATO will lead to the total loss of sovereignty,"" said the official representative of the Russian MFA, Maria Zaharova. ""I would like to believe that the Moldovan political beau monde understands, however, that the approach to NATO will not only not bring more security, but will lead to the total loss of sovereignty"", she mentioned

Russia's right to invade its neighbors and their obligation to remain neutral
NARRATIVE: Approaching NATO will not strengthen the Republic of Moldova's security, on the contrary, it will lead to the loss of statehood.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova is provided for in the Constitution voted in 1994 by a majority leftist parliament. Maintaining the status quo is promoted by pro-Moscow politicians as a guarantee of the country's security.
The collaboration of the Republic of Moldova with NATO started back in the 1990s, and one of the most important projects of the North Atlantic Alliance was the evacuation of important quantities of pesticides, left over from the Soviet era, and which represented a danger to the environment.
However, the North Atlantic Alliance is still presented as a scarecrow for a good part of the population of the Republic of Moldova, who sees it through the prism of Soviet propaganda and, more recently, of the Russian Federation.
The approach of the Republic of Moldova to the EU is viewed critically by Moscow and pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau. Theses about the preparation of the Republic of Moldova for a war against Russia, its involvement in military conflicts, the use of infrastructure by NATO to support Ukraine in the war with Russia are increasingly used lately, in order to feed the citizens' fear of war.
On the other hand, the status of neutrality is not a guarantor of security in front of Moscow, as shown by the invasion of Georgia in 2008, then the annexation of Crimea and the creation of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine in 2014. The Russian military invasion of Ukraine in 2022 determined some traditionally neutral states, such as Finland and Sweden, to review their security and neutrality policies.
OBJECTIVE: Fueling distrust in the EU and NATO, which would undermine and destroy the statehood and national sovereignty of the member states, without ensuring additional security.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: NATO's 74-year history shows that no member state has been subjected to any attack by another state, a fact that speaks of the level of security it provides to its members. It is true that NATO could not ensure the security of the Republic of Moldova in case of an attack from outside, not being a member of it, but it can contribute to increasing its defense capacity and to the professionalization of the Moldovan armed forces.
NATO is not the Warsaw Pact
Within NATO, there are several mechanisms and procedures that guarantee member states their sovereignty, even if they are part of a military alliance. Thus, major decisions within NATO are taken by consensus. This means that all member countries must agree to any important decision that could affect their sovereignty. Thus, no country can be forced to accept a decision or an action with which it does not agree.
Also, each member country has the right to exercise its right of veto over any decision or action that could affect its national interests or sovereignty. In addition, within NATO, member countries voluntarily decide to participate in various operations and missions.
In the final declaration of the NATO Summit in Vilnius, the Allies reiterate their support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova and urge Russia to withdraw its military troops from its territory. In addition, NATO specifies that it respects the country's neutrality and any decision it makes regarding the geopolitical vector. ""We are firm in our support for the right of the Republic of Moldova to decide its own future and the direction of its foreign policy without external interference and we fully respect the constitutional neutrality of the Republic of Moldova"".
The ""danger"" of NATO expansion to the east is one of the main theses of Russian propaganda and one of the Kremlin's arguments for the invasion of Ukraine, but, in fact, it was Moscow's aggression that provoked Kiev, as well as other neighbors of Russia - Finland and Sweden - to demand joining NATO, to ensure its security.
NUTS OF TRUTH: The relations of the Republic of Moldova with NATO intensified after the Russian invasion in Ukraine, and in Chisinau there began to be more and more discussions about rethinking the policy and solutions for ensuring the country's security.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration from Chisinau reacted to the statements of Maria Zaharova, mentioning that the neutrality of the Republic of Moldova does not mean self-isolation.
""The authorities develop partnerships with those organizations and states that support and contribute to maintaining peace and security in our country. We underline the fact that at the NATO Summit in Vilnius, on July 11, the Alliance reiterated its support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence and respect for the neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova. Also, the NATO states have declared that they support the sovereign right of the Republic of Moldova to choose its development model, the course of its foreign policy and to decide its future without any outside interference"", according to a comment of the diplomacy from Chisinau, who reminded Moscow that it maintains troops on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, despite the neutrality status provided for in the Constitution, to which Zaharova refers.

""The men who fled the mobilization in Ukraine will be wanted by Interpol""
NEWS: ""The police in Kharkiv have started to transmit data to Interpol about the citizens of Ukraine who fled mobilization in the European Union states, said the head of the Investigations Department of the National Police in the Kharkiv region, Serghei Bolvinov.
""We are the first in Ukraine to apply this scheme, in order not to allow... traitors to reach and hide in the civilized world"", wrote Bolvinov on Facebook (extremist organization, banned on the territory of Russia).
First of all, said the police representative, data is sent about Ukrainians who have gone into hiding and are suspected of committing crimes. At the moment, 25 ""traitors"" whom Ukraine wants to return home have been included in the database.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine has issued an international arrest warrant for Ukrainians who fled the mobilization.
Reality: Ukraine interacts with Interpol in the field of identifying Russian collaborators in the EU, not refugee men
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Russian state media deliberately misrepresented a Facebook post by an official from the Kharkiv region to show that the men who fled the mobilization order of the Ukrainian authorities would be wanted by Interpol and brought home
""Not everyone who fled from the territories liberated by the Armed Forces of Ukraine reached the Russian world. There are many cases of identification of fans of the Russian Federation hiding in the European Union. They declared that they are Ukrainians, that they suffer from the war and need support"", wrote the head of the Investigation Department of the National Police in the Kharkiv region, Serghei Bolvinov.
He added that Ukrainian citizens who collaborated with Russia and its occupation bodies will be accused of treason and brought to the country through Interpol.
""I sent the data in the case of 25 escapees. Therefore, I make a separate appeal to all those who have information about the collaborators who are currently in Europe. Write to us, provide us with data about such a person and the country where he is hiding and we will do our job. We will not give them peace even abroad!"", added the Ukrainian official.
Therefore, the post does not mention anything about the men who fled the mobilization, but only about the collaborators of the Russians from the eastern and southern regions of the country. However, the Russian press wrote that Serghei Bolvinov's statements refer to all Ukrainian men, which is not true.
In fact, this false narrative is a repetition of the information that appeared in the Russian media in the middle of 2022. At that time, Russian propaganda is trying to convince the public opinion that the EU will deport refugee men to Ukraine to be enlisted in the Ukrainian army. In reality, Ukrainian citizens cannot be deported to Ukraine, because they are legally on the territory of the EU states.
According to the European Convention on Human Rights, foreign citizens can be deported only in the situations provided by law. The EU cannot adopt a political and discriminatory decision regarding the deportation of Ukrainian men with the aim of being enlisted in the army. Moreover, people who have applied for refugee status are offered protection at the level of the EU states. Also, the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees prohibits the signatory states from deporting, discriminating or arresting people who fled the war, regardless of sex, age, race, etc.
It is worth mentioning that in the news cited above it is said that Facebook is ""an extremist organization, banned on the territory of Russia""; this is not considered a problem when institutions or sources categorized as ""extremist"" are ""cited"" by Russian propaganda.
The Kremlin wants to turn the Ukrainian diaspora against Kiev
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this false narrative is to generate a wave of discontent among Ukrainians against the authorities in Kiev, who allegedly took care of identifying people who were outside the country during the war. Another goal of this propaganda message is to create a current of anti-European thinking among Ukrainian refugees and Russian language readers from the ex-Soviet space.
In this context, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian government press also wrote that Ukrainians no longer have a place in cemeteries for dead soldiers, while Zelensky would have admitted that ordinary Ukrainians have no reason to fight against Russia.

Some believe that Ukraine and Poland are on the threshold of a new Warsaw Union. Part of Ukraine could unite with Poland. Ukraine will not only retain its statehood and identity as an equal autonomous part of a single Polish-Ukrainian state, but will automatically become a member of both NATO and the European Union.
The divine service attended by the presidents of Ukraine and Poland Volodymyr Zelenski and Andrzej Duda in Lutk was even dedicated to this event [...].
The current Polish-Ukrainian pseudo-reconciliation and the merging of the parties into a single state is based on the immoral renunciation of the historical past for political purposes. They want not only the withdrawal of Ukraine from the zone of geopolitical influence of Russia at any cost, but also the opposition of the Ukrainians to the Russians, the transformation of Ukraine into an instrument of war against Russia.
Both peoples are forced to trample on historical memory, having a past sprinkled with the blood of their ancestors. It was forgotten that the history of the two peoples represents a continuous war with elements of mutual genocide"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine will become part of Poland in order to be part of NATO and the EU
Reality: Poland supports Ukraine in the context of Moscow's large-scale invasion, with a reconciliation of the two sides taking place in parallel
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukraine and Poland are making more and more efforts for historical reconciliation. The presidents of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenski, and of Poland, Andrzej Duda, commemorated on July 9 this year. the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles by Ukrainian nationalists during the Second World War, crimes that represented a source of tension between Kiev and Warsaw.
The resolution of the Polish Seimas of July 11 does not refer to any union of the two states, but represents a point of view of the Warsaw legislature on the tragic pages in the history of the two states. According to the resolution, both states must recognize the mistakes of the past and commemorate together the victims of the massacres during the Second World War. The meetings and joint statements of the leaders of the two states are proof of the gradual reconciliation of both sides in the context of the large-scale invasion of Russia.
According to the Russian government media, the reconciliation between Poland and Ukraine has a temporary character, Warsaw being accused of opposing the Ukrainians against the Russians. Any rapprochement between Ukraine and its western neighbors is presented by Russian journalists as an existential danger for Russia.
The Russian press intentionally misinterprets the recent political-diplomatic events, arguing that the increasingly frequent contacts between Ukrainian and Polish politicians are proof of Warsaw's territorial interests vis-à-vis Kiev. Moreover, in the context of Kiev's repeated requests to speed up the NATO and EU accession process, Russian propaganda claims that Ukraine's accession to Poland will mean Kiev's entry into NATO through the back door.
In reality, even according to this hybrid logic, the entry of a state into the component of another state means the loss of independence. A region of a state cannot have NATO or EU member status. The arguments presented in the press article are completely disconnected from reality.
In another vein, Poland was one of the most important supporters of Ukraine in the context of Russia's large-scale invasion. Warsaw demonstrated through actions that it is a real supporter of Ukraine: it condemned the Russian aggression, supported the Ukrainian army, facilitated the institutional approach of Kiev to the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Poland is one of the staunchest supporters of sanctions against Moscow. At the same time, Poland accepted that the main transit routes for the weapons that the West delivers to Ukraine should be developed on its territory.
The Polish state introduced sanctions against Russia after February 24, 2022 and requested the EU and NATO to provide Ukraine with heavy weapons. Warsaw expressed its desire to have nuclear weapons placed on its territory and supported the territorial integrity of Ukraine at all international forums.
Warsaw's actions are not determined by the desire to expand territorially to the detriment of Ukraine (which would contradict its status as an EU and NATO member), but by the fear that Poland will be Moscow's next target. Despite the diminishing fears regarding the invasion of Poland by the Russian army, after almost 17 months of war in Ukraine, sociological surveys show Russia as the main enemy of the Poles.
The reconciliation between Poland and Ukraine takes place in a difficult geopolitical context. ""Russia will never win if a Pole and a Ukrainian stand side by side. We remain together in this war and we will enjoy together in peace"", declared Volodymyr Zelensky in the spring of this year, sparking critical reactions in Moscow.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives by Russia regarding a possible aggression of Poland on Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that a referendum on joining Poland will be organized in the Lviv region, after which Warsaw will start a war against Russia. The publications from Moscow tried to convince the public opinion that Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to capture a part of Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Belarus and Russia are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and possible NATO aggression. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: A peace plan proposed by Russia is increasingly supported in the EU.
Reality: The EU leadership condemned Russia's unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, and the Russian press cited a member of the European Parliament who collaborates with Moscow
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media presented the statement of MEP Herve Juvin as a point of view of the European Legislature, mentioning that EU states are beginning to understand that peace in Ukraine is impossible without taking into account Russia's conditions. In reality, Herve Juvin does not represent the EU or the European Parliament. On the contrary, in the last eight years, the politician has become a star of the propaganda of the Russian Federation, being the spokesperson of the ""National Front"" party, financed by Russian banks. Juvin has been quoted by the Russian government press on various occasions. Among his statements the most scandalous, we mention the accusation of NATO for starting the war in Ukraine and the requests to the leadership of France to leave the North Atlantic Alliance.
Herve Juvin was invited by Moscow to visit Crimea several times, where he participated as an observer in various elections not recognized by the international community. He expressed his admiration for the smooth conduct of the recent referendum for the annexation of the peninsula to Russia and spoke for the international recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. Herve Juvin has been repeating various propaganda narratives of the Kremlin for several years, including those regarding Russia's legitimate claim to build a multipolar world and eliminate US dominance in international relations.
It should be noted that a resolution of the European Parliament says that Russia ""sponsors terrorism and uses terrorist means"" in its war in Ukraine, committing ""war crimes"". The EU has repeatedly condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine, and European states support Kiev's defensive efforts. The EU stands in solidarity with Ukraine and will continue to resolutely support the economy, society, the armed forces and the future reconstruction of Ukraine, according to the EU Council. During the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in February 2023, EU leaders reiterated their support for Ukraine's initiative for a just peace, including President Zelenski's 10-point peace plan. There is no official document or statement by a European official that recognizes Russia's conditions for peace in Ukraine as legitimate.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that NATO supports Ukraine to cause a world war, while Russia and China want peace on the globe. According to Russian propaganda, the EU sent troops to Ukraine before 2022 to weaken Russia, and the UN denounced the crimes committed by Ukrainian nationalists. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ,,Be careful how loud. Parliament quickly passed a law that will make life impossible for those who use personal cars. Thus, the fees for using the roads will be calculated according to the pollution norm and the duration of the infrastructure. There is also a computer application developed for mobile phones that uses satellite localization. In this case, it is not about a new ruin, but about the supervision of CNAIR.

NARRATIVE: The new road tariffs will allow the implementation of additional restrictive measures against the population.
CONTEXT: Several European states provide in the road legislation for the payment by car owners of certain ""road taxes"", whose purpose is to cover or contribute to the costs of building new roads and maintaining the existing infrastructure, reducing traffic peaks by applying higher prices in more congested periods and areas, or reducing pollution by applying lower rates to less polluting vehicles. Last week, the Romanian Parliament adopted a draft law on the application of new road rates on the national road network. The measures are intended to align the Romanian legislation with the rules approved five years ago by the European Parliament, the purpose of which is to guarantee equal treatment of road users and to help the member states achieve their objectives of reducing CO2 emissions. carbon in the transport sector.
OBJECTIVE: Reducing the population's trust in the authorities, provoking and amplifying possible social tensions.
Monitoring of freight transport already exists
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The measures voted by the Parliament will enter into force from 2026 and differentiate, from the point of view of the payment obligation, vehicles for the transport of goods from those used in personal interest. Thus, the car owners will pay the toll depending on the degree of pollution of the car and the duration for which they purchase it, and the cargo trucks will pay a road tariff, called TollRo, which will be established according to the distance traveled. Therefore, in terms of personal cars, they will not be monitored during travel, but only regarding the payment of the toll, through a computerized monitoring and management system, as is currently done. In addition, the regulation does not cover the inner-city areas, where the majority of cars in Romania circulate.
Indeed, the law provides for the voluntary installation of a mobile application by freight and passenger carriers, but this is only one of the three ways to pay TollRo, the rate that will be applied to all vehicles designed and built for the transport of cargo with a maximum authorized total weight greater than 3.5 tons. However, the monitoring of transporters is not a novelty, it has been centralized, at the national level, for a year, through the RO e-Transport system. In addition, most transport companies have fleet monitoring systems that allow real-time identification of the driver and the generation of reports to highlight his activity. These applications even generate reports about the driver's driving style, even issuing alerts in case of violation of traffic restrictions and highlight the driving times and breaks taken by him.

In fact, the opening of a National Military Memorial was requested.
Propaganda: Following the unsuccessful counteroffensive of Kiev, the Ukrainian soldiers killed by Russia have nowhere to be buried
NEWS: ""In Kiev, there was an action organized by the relatives of the soldiers killed in the Azov regiment (a terrorist organization banned in Russia), who demanded an increase in the number of cemeteries in Ukraine.
The organizers of the action declared that the lack of places in cemeteries for the killed soldiers is becoming a national problem in Ukraine and pushes people to organize rallies [...].
The unsuccessful counter-offensive of the Ukrainian army generated a very large number of victims among the military personnel. All morgues and all cemeteries are full of killed fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The old unmarked graves are dug in Lviv due to the lack of space in the cemetery. In Ivano-Frankivsk, the cemetery has grown so much that the municipality decided to open there stations with electric scooters that can be rented to reach the graves.
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainians demand the opening of new cemeteries to have a place to bury the soldiers who died on the front.
Reality: In Kiev there was a rally of the relatives of the soldiers killed by Russia for the opening of a National Military Memorial
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russian government media presents a rally organized by relatives of Ukrainian servicemen for the opening of a National Military Memorial as a protest against the war. The context of the news is distorted to manipulate public opinion.
Most of the press bodies in Kiev reported on the dissatisfaction of the relatives of the Ukrainian soldiers who fell on the front because of the delay in the opening of the Memorial. It is about the establishment of a cemetery where the heroes of the war, who gave their lives for the future and freedom of Ukraine, will be buried. The participants in the mass action asked the Ukrainian authorities to expedite this process, and to build a National Military Memorial near Kiev.
It should be noted that on May 31, 2022, the Supreme Rada of Ukraine adopted the National Military Memorial Law to honor those who fell in the war. According to this law, a local memorial will be created in each locality, and the town halls must provide land for this purpose. The blocking of this process in some regions of Ukraine generated dissatisfaction in society in the context of the continuation of hostilities.
The Russian government press distorted the context of this information, mentioning that following the unsuccessful counteroffensive of Kiev, the Ukrainian soldiers killed by Russia no longer have a place to be buried. The creation of the National Military Memorial and the local memorials has nothing to do with the Ukrainian counteroffensive, being a legislative obligation of the Ukrainian state assumed since 2022. According to the associations of war veterans in Ukraine, the National Military Memorial must be located near the Bikivnia Mounds, where the Ukrainians who are buried are buried were persecuted by the Soviet regime. According to the Ministry of Culture, the National Military Memorial will be modeled after the Arlington Cemetery in the USA.
Therefore, a rally of the relatives of soldiers killed by Russia took place in Kiev for the opening of a National Military Memorial, an event that has nothing to do with the Ukrainian counter-offensive. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: Ukrainian refugees will apply for Russian citizenship to protect their children on EU territory.
Reality: Kiev deals with the problems of its citizens, who became war refugees, while Russia kidnapped and deported Ukrainian children
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there were a number of problems caused by the differences in legislation and the lack of documents of Ukrainian citizens. As a result, there was an interaction of specialized institutions from European states with refugee minors from Ukraine, but it is not about taking them by force.
According to the People's Advocate of Ukraine, Dmytro Lubinet, the Ukrainian authorities are aware of every situation that has arisen in European states regarding minors who have become war refugees. He told TSN that most of the problems arise as a result of legislative differences. ""In Ukraine, the grandmother is automatically considered the grandson's guardian, and in most European states, this is not the case. The European authorities have initiated various procedures. We intervened, we explained the situation"", mentioned the People's Advocate of Ukraine.
According to the official from Kiev, many children arrived in the EU without documents and even now they do not have passports. Being notified in advance to deal with this problem, many Ukrainians did nothing and now they are considered to be illegal in the EU territory. ""I recently talked with the ombudsmen of the Italian regions, I asked them to solve each case. I told them each child's name. All the announced situations have been resolved"", says Lubinet.
In this context, the problems of Ukrainian refugees in the EU are used by Russian propaganda to demonstrate that Ukraine is a state that does not care about its citizens. Moreover, according to the false narratives from Russia, Kiev does not want to argue with the European states and leaves the Ukrainian minors and their parents without any help. The involvement of Ukrainian diplomats in solving the refugee problems is ignored by the Russian government media.
For these reasons, the experts cited in Russia predict an increase in requests to obtain Russian citizenship. The reader is left with the impression that the Ukrainian refugees are abandoned by their state and are desperately asking for help from Moscow or even Belarus. The statements about the desire of the Ukrainians to obtain the citizenship of the state that attacked them militarily and made them leave their country are only an assumption and are not based on evidence. Starting from a grain of truth regarding the situation of some Ukrainian minors in the EU, who do not have documents or who have arrived in foreign countries without parents, the Russian press comes to the conclusion that Ukraine does not help them because it does not want to upset the West, which is not this is true.
In addition, the false narrative is promoted in the Russian-speaking information space in order to absolve Russia. In April a.c. 49 UN and EU member states condemned Russia for abusing the rights and privileges of a permanent member of the Security Council to spread disinformation about the ""generalized abductions of thousands of Ukrainian children"". At the beginning of May, the OSCE published a report according to which a large number of Ukrainian children were deported to Russia and the territories occupied by it. The OSCE mentions that Russia violated the rights of Ukrainian children illegally taken to Russian territory, which could at some point be classified as crimes against humanity. 45 member countries requested an investigation into the deportations of Ukrainian children.
Veridica dismantled other false narratives from the Russian Federation regarding the situation of civilians in the context of the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Ukrainian children are sold to the West, and the losses of the Ukrainian army are so high that students are forced to donate blood for the military. The Russian press also wrote that only Russian speakers from the east are mobilized in the army because they want to exterminate them, and Kiev gives money to those who trick their friends into enlisting.

The Russian Foreign Minister also asked the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, to -use his authority and make Kiev publish a list of the names of all those who died in the Ukrainian city of Bucea, mentioning that it seems that only Russia is interested in this topic.
NARRATIVE: The UN accused Ukraine of torturing civilians.
Reality: Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine in the context of the large-scale invasion
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the report of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights ""Detention of civilians in the context of the armed attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine (February 24, 2022 - May 23, 2023)"" represents an analysis of the situation of civilians in detention in the period of the war Most of the cases of torture and other abuses described in the report do not refer to Ukraine, but to Russia.
The report accuses Russia of committing war crimes in a number of Ukrainian localities, but also mentions some ""insignificant violations of the law"" by representatives of Ukraine's law enforcement forces.
According to the report, ""91 percent of civilians in Russian custody reported torture, ill-treatment, including rape."" In other words, the report accuses Russia, not Ukraine, of mass torturing civilians. The UN expresses its concern in the connection with the execution by Russia of 77 civilians until May 23 BC. According to the report, access to Russian information and places of detention was only partial, which means that the crimes committed by Russia on the territory of Ukraine could be much more many than those known now.
The report notes that there are also cases of abuse committed by the Ukrainian military, but the UN experts mention Kiev's willingness to collaborate with the OHCHR. Ukraine is not accused of executing civilians, but of harsh behavior in some cases towards those who were suspected of committing crimes against the population during the occupation. Starting from this kernel of truth, the Russian government media wrote that only Ukraine was accused by the UN of torturing civilians, citing some past statements by Moscow officials.
The news was written by taking out of context some information convenient to Russian propaganda and citing the source incompletely in order to manipulate public opinion in order to justify Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the attitude of some international organizations towards the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that NATO supports Ukraine to cause a world war, while Russia and China want peace on the globe. According to Russian propaganda, the EU sent troops to Ukraine before 2022 to weaken Russia, and the UN denounced the crimes committed by Ukrainian nationalists. Publication / Media:

The deputies refused and Russian was declared as the language of interethnic communication alongside Moldovan as the state language. These disputes led to a conflict in Gagauzia and to war in Transnistria and to the division of the country.

On their initiative, the Parliament approved, on March 23, the change of the name of the state language to Romanian. It did not have votes for the amendment of the Constitution, so that it still states the name of the Moldovan language""
NARRATIVE: The pro-European government in Chisinau persecutes Russian speakers in the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the Republic of Moldova, during the former USSR, the Russian language was the language of the communist elites and minorities, especially Russians and Ukrainians; as in the Tsarist period until 1918, Russian was practically the language of the occupying power, having a higher status than the Romanian language, even if the latter has always been the language spoken by the majority of the population.
According to the legislation adopted at the end of the Soviet period, the Russian language was given the role of the language of interethnic communication. But the law was declared obsolete (obsolete) by the Constitutional Court. Meanwhile, the share of national minorities decreased, and according to the 2014 census, 82% of the population declared themselves Moldovan/Romanian (in 2004, 78% declared themselves Moldovan/Romanian), followed by Ukrainians - 6.6%, Gagauzians - 4 .6% and Russians - 4.4%.
Although the share of Russian-speaking minorities is decreasing, there are still politicians and parties that try to use minorities for electoral purposes, including by promoting topics such as the declaration of the Russian language as the second state language.
They were brought back to the fore after the Chisinau Parliament voted a law by which it excludes the phrase ""Moldovan language"" from the legislation and replaced it with ""Romanian language"". The legislature thus implemented a decision of the Constitutional Court from December 2013, which established that the text of the Declaration of Independence, which establishes the Romanian language as the state language, prevails over the text of the Constitution (voted in 1994 by a center-left parliament) in which the state language was called ""Moldovan"".
OBJECTIVE: To feed the phobias of national minorities regarding the fact that the pro-European government in Chisinau will undermine their rights. To maintain the pro-Russian and anti-Western views of the majority of representatives of national minorities.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The manipulation of TASS is visible from the headline of the news, taken over by several media institutions from Russia and the Republic of Moldova, including from the separatist region of Transnistria, where the subject is even more sensitive than in the area controlled by Chisinau. In fact, deputy Soimaru did not refer to all Russian speakers. The Russian press agency puts in quotation marks its own assumption that the deputy had in mind ""the need to apply fines against Russian speakers"", thus leaving the impression that it represents a quote from the deputy's statements, although he did not state this.
Vasile Soimaru showed himself really disturbed during the debates in the Parliament that some deputies do not know or do not speak the official language of the country - Romanian - and declared that he has a mechanism to stop this situation - an economic one. But he referred exclusively to deputies who, by law, are obliged to know Romanian.
The struggle of the majority population in the Republic of Moldova to return to the Latin script and the Romanian language from the late 80s - early 90s is qualified by Russian propaganda as one of the main reasons for the creation of the Transnistrian secessionist region. In reality, Transnistria - created, anyway, by the Soviets in the 20s to be a bridgehead for the capture of Bessarabia - allowed Moscow to keep a lever in the region after the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Moldova and the collapse of the USSR; Russia's involvement in the 1992 war is a clear proof that it was behind the separatists. Historians also consider that separatism was a reaction of the political and economic elites on the left of the Dniester, patrons of Moscow, in an attempt to maintain their status and privileges that they had created during the Soviet period. The American historian Charles King says, for example, that Transnistrian separatism ""was not a revolt of minorities, but of political and economic elites"".
It is also a lie that the name of the language was not changed in the Constitution. In fact, the Law voted by the parliament provides for the execution of the decision of the Constitutional Court from December 2013, which refers to the Romanian language as the state language. Accordingly, the name of the language was changed in the text of the Constitution.

It happened, definitely in coordination, not to mention the insistence of the governing party. The referral was submitted to the Constitutional Court by its Government. There is no doubt that it is a violation of the provision of the constitution that prohibits the usurpation of state power by a political party"". NARRATIVE: The Sor party was outlawed at the behest of the government and the decision of the Constitutional Court was a political one, based on arguments that are not valid.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On June 19, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova declared the Sor Party unconstitutional, following a notification filed in November 2022 by the Government. The Court came to the conclusion that the Sor Political Party ""militates against the principles of the rule of law, sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Moldova"".
In its notification, the Government referred to several violations of the law committed by the Sor Party in the electoral campaigns that led to the exclusion of its candidates from the elections, the accusations of illegal financing of the party, including from external sources, but also the inclusion of the party and its leader or, the fugitive politician Ilan Sor on the American government's sanctions list, based on the Magnitki Act. ""This represents, through its actions, a threat to the existence or sovereignty of the state, to the democratic order within it,"" states the government, which says that unconstitutionality can also be proclaimed in ""cases when political parties essentially represent criminal associations or use as instruments of political struggle and promotion of one's own agenda of secret or subversive methods"".
On October 26, the US Treasury included the Sor Party and its leader in the list of sanctions, arguing that they tried to divert the European course of the Republic of Moldova and bring it back into the sphere of influence of Russia, collaborating in this sense with individuals from the Russian Federation.
Ilan Sor is an oligarch who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his involvement in a major bank robbery in 2014. In 2016, the oligarch entered politics and founded the Sor Party based on a pro-Russian political formation. He was mayor of Orhei and deputy from 2019 until recently, when his mandate was revoked after he was convicted. In 2019, he fled to Israel, whose citizenship he holds. Since 2022, Sor's formation has organized several anti-government protests which, according to the American authorities, were aimed at establishing a regime favorable to Moscow.
OBJECTIVE: To present the pro-European government from Chisinau as a dictatorial one and thus reduce the number of supporters of European integration. To present the Sor Party as a political victim, thereby favoring the growth of the image of its leaders.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Before ruling, the Constitutional Court also requested an opinion from the Venice Commission regarding the Government's approach from last November. The Venice Commission noted that a decision regarding the declaration of the unconstitutionality of a political party may represent an interference with the right to free association, therefore the decision must be based on legality, legitimacy and necessity. In the same document, the Commission specifies that it is within the powers of the Constitutional Court to rule on this subject.
In the reasoning presented by the Constitutional Court shortly after the pronouncement of the decision, the institution presents the arguments it took into account. This reminds of the multiple cases in which the Sor Party violated the legislation regarding the financing of political parties; the practice continued even after the authorities decided on sanctions and in spite of some final decisions of the courts, which shows the systemic nature of the violation of the law. The sanctions imposed by the EU, the United States and Norway on the Sor Party are mentioned in context, as well as documents issued by the Chisinau authorities, including the Information and Security Service, which show the involvement of a foreign state (it is Russia, which is not explicitly mentioned in the decision) in the financing of this political formation.
The Constitutional Court also recorded the opinion of the Venice Commission according to which ""the general situation in the country is an important factor in evaluating the use by a party of inappropriate or even illegal means to distract voters from other parties or even the use of resources to undermine the correctness or integrity of the political competition, leading to distortions of the electoral process, through the unfairly obtained advantage, supported by unauthorized foreign financing"" and appreciated that the organization of protests aimed at overthrowing the government and the financing coming from outside have intensified after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, in the conditions in which the conflict also affects the security of the Republic of Moldova. In addition, the Court ""noted that the party's objective to overthrow the democratic order can be deduced from the cases of non-transparent financing, from the protests organized and non-transparently paid for by party and from the claims of party representatives and even of Mr. Ilan Sor exposed during these meetings.""
A number of experts from Chisinau considered the Court's decision to be justified and reasoned.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The decision of June 19 is a first for the Republic of Moldova and, indeed, there is no legal framework that accurately provides for the procedures that follow after the declaration of the unconstitutionality of a political party, but the Court's decision provides that they will be dealt with a commission created by the Ministry of Justice.

In the explanatory note of the meeting of the Federation Council, it is said that after the annexation of the People's Republic of Donetsk, the regions of Zaporozhye and Kherson to Russia, the Sea of ​​Azov became an internal sea of ​​Russia, and Ukraine lost its status as a country with access to the coast.

If this initiative became a reality, there would be an obvious danger for our country.""
NARRATIVE: The Sea of ​​Azov became an internal sea of ​​Russia in order not to allow the placement of foreign military bases.
Reality: Ukraine has not given up its territories that open to the Sea of ​​Azov and wants to recover them from Russia
Why the narrative is false: The annexation of some Ukrainian regions to Russia following recent referendums was not recognized by Ukraine and most of the world's states. The international community condemned both the war started by Russia against Ukraine, as well as the annexation of the Kherson, Zaporozhye, Donetsk and Luhansk regions, partially captured by Russian forces. Also, the annexation of Crimea has been condemned countless times. The illegal occupation of these Ukrainian territories cannot be a legal basis for considering the Sea of ​​Azov an internal sea.
In order to prove to public opinion that Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is a success, the pro-Kremlin press writes that the Sea of ​​Azov has legally become an internal sea in the context of Ukraine's unilateral withdrawal from a bilateral treaty with Russia , signed in 2003. On December 19, 2022, the Kyiv Parliament denounced the cooperation agreement with Russia in the Sea of ​​Azov, arguing that Moscow violated the norms of international law and annexed some Ukrainian regions by military means. The Russian press presented the denunciation of this agreement as a recognition by Kiev of Russia's right to use the Sea of ​​Azov as an internal sea.
In reality, the denunciation of the agreement was motivated in Kiev by the transformation of Russia into an enemy state, which has militarized the Black and Azov seas and which must liberate all the occupied Ukrainian localities. The Kyiv parliament did not recognize Russia's territorial annexations and launched a necessary legal mechanism in the context of the future liberation of the regions occupied by Moscow.
After the annexation of Crimea, Russia limited the access of Ukrainian ships to the Sea of ​​Azov, despite the fact that according to international norms, 2/3 of the waters should be under the control of Kiev. In 2016, Ukraine sued Russia at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, requesting the restoration of its access to the Sea of ​​Azov.
The information in the Russian press about the blocking of the process of locating foreign military bases in the Sea of ​​Azov is another invention of pro-Kremlin propaganda. The issue of locating such bases in the Sea of ​​Azov has never been raised. In addition, in order to block such an initiative, if it had appeared at a given moment, it was not necessary to occupy other Ukrainian territories because Russia controlled the Kerch Strait. At the same time, the advisors of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have repeatedly stated that Ukraine aims to recover Crimea this year in order to restore the historical and political truth.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about Russia's successes in the war in Ukraine. The pro-Kremlin press wrote that a civil war is taking place in Ukraine for the restoration of Great Russia, while the ""special military operation"" is saving Russia from Western aggression. According to Russian propaganda, Moscow must mobilize to defeat NATO in the new, ""war for the defense of the homeland"". Also, the Russian press claims that Putin warned Ukraine 23 years ago that NATO would cause a war. Publication / Media:

Food only for the chosen ones
NEWS: ""Supermarkets in Great Britain have started to implement a new digital passport system that denies ordinary citizens the opportunity to buy food if they are blacklisted for non-compliance. According to images posted on Twitter this week, the Aldi supermarket chain has started denying access to people who do not have a digital passport on their phone. In the viral video, a man behind the camera showed viewers the barriers that block access to the shopping area for those who do not have a passport. [...] Also, Amazon and other companies have recently launched similar stores in several countries.""
NARRATIVE: People who do not obey the digital dictatorship will be eliminated by denying access to food.
CONTEXT: With the accelerated development of technology, more and more aspects of daily life are subject to transformations, in the sense of digitization and automation of operational processes. The goals of these changes differ from case to case and have in mind the efficiency of activities, the reduction of execution times, or even the elimination of bureaucratic aspects and errors generated by the human factor. Such a transformation is being tested these days by a chain of consumer goods stores in England, an opportunity for conspiracy theorists to once again accuse the preparation of digital camps where people will be imprisoned in the near future.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the authorities and the entire political class, promoting the sovereignist discourse, provoking and amplifying social tensions.
In a highly competitive market, there will always be alternatives
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In general, the digitization of activities is carried out with the help of applications installed on the electronic devices that almost every citizen owns, whether we are talking about computers, mobile phones or smart watches, etc. In the case of the test in the London store under discussion, we are dealing with such an application, and in no case can we talk about a ""digital passport"". Thus, access to the store is based on a QR code generated by it application, and the customer's entire shopping experience is subsequently automated. He does not have to pay when leaving the store, because smart cameras track the items he buys, calculate the total cost of the products and automatically withdraw the corresponding amount from the user's bank account, previously introduced in the application. It is obvious that a non-user of the respective application will not be able to benefit from this service, and the fact that in this way he is denied access to shopping can only be attributed to the store through the lens of a faulty management of the portfolio of potential customers. It is also worth noting that the shopping experience 100% independent of the interaction with a human operator has been implemented by the same chain of stores since July 2022 in the Netherlands, but that information escaped the attention of domestic conspiracists at that time. The entire system for scanning customers and the products they buy, functional for almost a year in the European Union, is designed to protect the identities and confidentiality of buyers, in accordance with the strictest European data protection regulations. In any case, the success of this technological approach ultimately depends on the degree of acceptance by consumers. The sales strategy of a store that is permanently empty, or with insufficient revenue to cover maintenance expenses, will definitely be rethought, in an extremely competitive market, with an increasingly informed public and unwilling to extreme compromises when it comes it's about his basic needs.

The false narrative was widely distributed by the Russian press.
Propaganda: The war in Ukraine is caused by a series of foreign interests, therefore Bucharest must not get involved
NEWS: ""Senator from Romania Diana Sosoaca declared that Ukraine is non-existent from a legal point of view because its borders are not recognized by the UN and it has no agreements with its neighbors. The parliamentarian mentioned that Ukraine has problems with Russia, but Bucharest should not get involved in this conflict"", according to the Argumenti publication, which recalls that the ""special military operation"" launched by Russia is being carried out successfully.
""Why should we be put in the middle of American interests, NATO interests and take bombs to my head, send my child to the front in Ukraine"", Diana Sosoaca is quoted by the Telegram channel ""Russia now"" , mentioning an awakening of public opinion in Romania.
""The state that has unrecognized borders does not exist from a legal point of view"", writes Livejournal, mentioning that this point of view was expressed by the representative of the Romanian Senate, who in the past requested the annexation of some territories by Bucharest from the Ukrainian component.
NARRATIVE: Bucharest should not support Ukraine in the war because its borders are not recognized.
Reality: Ukraine's borders have been recognized internationally, including by Russia, which, in addition, has guaranteed them
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In order to justify the war started by Moscow against the Ukrainian state, the Russian government media and Telegram channels from Moscow translated a fragment of the conversation between Senator Diana Sosoaca and journalist Luis Lazarus, in which the parliamentarian argues that Ukraine should not be supported from Romania. Diana Sosoaca's statement was quoted by one of the most read Telegram channels in the post-Soviet space, ""Russia now"" (1.6 million subscribers), being picked up by Russian media and the Ukrainian regions occupied by the Russian army. The statement is presented as an awakening of public opinion in Romania, a correct and appropriate point of view. The Russian press recalls that Diana Sosoaca officially requested the annexation of territories inhabited by Romanian-speaking communities in Ukraine in the context of discussions about the successful implementation of the ""special military operation "".
In reality, at the time of the outbreak of the war in Donbass and the annexation of Crimea, Ukraine had border recognition agreements with all its neighbors, including Romania and Russia. At the same time, Diana Sosoaca does not represent the point of view of the Romanian Parliament or the Romanian society, as the Russian press claims.
Through a Russian-Ukrainian agreement of 2003, Moscow recognized the state borders of Ukraine, and Kiev - of Russia. According to the agreement, Russia recognized Crimea as Ukrainian territory. Moreover, through the Budapest Memorandum, Russia offered Ukraine security guarantees in exchange for giving up the nuclear arsenal inherited from the USSR. Also, the Kremlin has committed itself to never attack Ukraine through the agreements regarding the deployment of the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. All these international agreements were violated by Russia, starting with the annexation of Crimea and ending with the large-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The statement regarding the non-recognition of Ukraine's borders by the UN is also false. In 2014, the UN General Assembly expressed its support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine. In 2022, 143 UN states condemned the aggression of the Russian Federation and spoke for the territorial integrity of Ukraine based on the UN Charter. The war in Ukraine is a military aggression by Moscow, and Ukraine has an inherent right to defend itself. In this context, according to international law, Romania or any other state can support Kiev's right to defend itself against armed aggression.
The Russian press quotes Diana Sosoaca quite often, presenting her position as a dominant one in Romanian society. In April, the Russian press wrote that the senator's speeches are very brave and fair because they show concrete evidence that Ukraine is a terrorist state. The Russian press also wrote that Diana Sosoaca opposes the pro-Western policy of Bucharest which helps the ""regime in Kiev"". At the same time, the publication ""Vzglead"" called Diana Sosoaca a fascist senator, but who shows to be friendly with Moscow. At the same time, the publication EurAsia Daily called Diana Sosoaca a dedicated anti-NATO fighter who tells the truth.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives launched by Senator Diana Sosoaca in the Romanian information space. In April a.c. Diana Sosoaca declared that the future Polish-Ukrainian state will dismember Romania. In March, the senator submitted to Parliament a law that provides for the annexation of territories belonging to Ukraine. At the beginning of this year, Diana Sosoaca said that Western occult forces will take the children of Romanian families. Publication / Media:

From monkey to man and back
NEWS: ""It is desired that the future will bring the involution of man. Citizens will be able to receive a guaranteed minimum income to ensure their food and needs, i.e. what is strictly necessary. An alarming number of people seem to be delighted by this news, daydreaming of the day when they will be paid to sit on the couch watching TV. This system is already being tested in Great Britain and in the Nordic countries. A similar model, that of working from home, appeared during the pandemic, with a series of advantages that attracted citizens who decided to change their lifestyle and work. This is how the transhumanist mechanism of subjugating the citizens, disappearing social contact, has already been set in motion. Now we are moving towards the implementation of the guaranteed minimum income, a step correlated with the 15-minute cities which are nothing more than another manufactured lockdown, but which people must perceive as natural.""
NARRATIVE: In the near future, people will be isolated from the community, having their basic needs met through unconditional universal income.
CONTEXT: The idea of ​​distributing a part of the budget revenues to all citizens of a state, only on the basis of citizenship and without the obligation to prove the need for such financial aid, is a global phenomenon, with different approaches from country to country. In principle, regardless of the individual's financial status, the state guarantees him a basic income, so that he can get rid of food and housing forever. Although it has a strong utopian component, the idea has become more and more interesting in the context of increasingly obvious social gaps, caused by the crises that the planet has been going through for several years (the Covid19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the meteorological phenomena caused by the changes climatic etc.). With the intensification of the debates on the universal basic income and in the context of the more frequent attempts to implement the concept in various countries, there have also been voices that see in this solution a hidden purpose, that of subjugating the population more easily and locking them up in camps digital, also limiting his freedom of movement. The theme represents a link between the conspiracy theories that claim that, in the end, the sanitary or the ecological dictatorship will enslave humanity.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the authorities and the entire political class, demonizing the West, promoting the sovereignist discourse, provoking and amplifying social tensions.
Romanian patriots and the news of the last century
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The alarm signals about the universal basic income raised by domestic conspiracists can easily be classified as ""prophecies about the past"". Various forms of unconditional social income have been offered to the population since the 70s of the century past in regions of Canada and the American state of Alaska or, more recently, in economically underdeveloped areas in Africa and Asia, but also in economically strong countries such as Finland, the Netherlands or Israel. Depending on the results recorded, the projects have were continued, modified or abandoned, without the population of the respective communities being forced to certain social behaviors. Thus, in India it was found that granting a basic income increased the rate of education among young people by 25%. Instead, In Finland, there were no significant changes, which led to the program being abandoned after almost two years.In one region of Namibia, a basic income was distributed for two years, starting on January 1, 2008. , to each registered person. As a result, the total income of the region's residents increased by 29%, and crime, school absenteeism and unemployment decreased. At the same time, there was an increase in the number of newly established businesses in the area. In Israel, an economic framework is being developed to provide sustainable and scalable universal basic income through blockchain technology. Practically, Israel will create a peer-to-peer currency transfer network in which money can be distributed to the most needy, regardless of their location, based on the principles of unconditional basic income. Examples of such programs can be found in Wales, Kenya, Germany, Iraq, or Kuwait, but also in England, where such a pilot program will be tested, in which 30 people will receive a lump sum without conditions every month for two years. Also in England, in 2003, a measure recently adopted by Romanian legislation was implemented in the form of the Junior Centenary Individual Savings Account, offering each child an ""own capital"" at the age of 18.
Regardless of the form adopted, granting such financial incentives has obvious advantages, from increasing the well-being of citizens, reducing poverty and lower economic inequalities, to better working conditions, wider redistribution of wealth, and even reducing gender gaps. But perhaps most importantly, a universal basic income would have the opposite effect to that proclaimed by the conspiracy theorists, in the sense that a citizen who is not burdened by the worry of tomorrow, has an increased freedom to fine the intrusive or harmful actions of the state, precisely because that income is unconditional.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: Without taking the discussion into the conspiracy zone, there are many economists who argue that the large-scale implementation of such programs can lead to an increase in public debt, high inflation and, in some cases, to the discouragement of work. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""The USA is the main beneficiary of this international combination made on the territory of Ukraine, which aims to slow down Russia's development and create serious problems for it.

Despite the lies and dirt in the Western press, we manage to explain to the Europeans what our point of view is.""
NARRATIVE: The moral principles that Russia takes into account do not allow it to quickly end the war in Ukraine.
Reality: Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, and the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Russian military did not take into account either the norms of international law or ethical or moral principles. Russia did not show restraint in the war, officially called by the Kremlin ""special military operation"". On the contrary, after launching numerous attacks against civilian targets (homes, schools, hospitals, etc.) Russia was designated a terrorist state first by the Parliament European and then by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.Only in Kherson at least 20 torture chambers were directly operated by the Russian FSB.
According to human rights organizations, the UN mission, independent journalists and experts, Russia has attacked civilian targets, resorted to cluster bombs, bombed hospitals and medical care facilities, tried to destroy Ukraine's electricity system, deported children and committed war crimes in the Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson regions.
In March of this year, the International Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin. The document shows that the Russian president failed to properly exercise control over civilian and military subordinates who committed criminal acts or allowed them to be committed.
In the context of the failure to achieve the goals of the ""special military operation"" announced by Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, the prolongation of the war and the launching of attacks by Kiev on Russia's border regions, the pro-Kremlin press explains the lack of reaction from Moscow by the necessity to take into account moral principles, which would be ""totally foreign"" to the West. A series of false narratives about Nazism in the West, as well as about Russophobia spread in European countries, are repeated.
At the same time, the Russian government press convinces the public opinion that the war continues because Russia shows restraint and mercy towards civilians. According to the false narratives, if instead of Ukraine it was Poland or Great Britain, these countries would be quickly destroyed by the Russian army, which used all possible methods. In reality, Russia has lost numerous battles, from that of Kiev to the Ukrainian counter-offensives in the fall of 2022. Moscow took the initiative at the end of last year, but the results of the offensive are more than modest, the Russian army being stuck in the battles of in Bahmut, a city of no strategic importance, according to military analysts.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Ukraine is a terrorist state that must be punished. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press demonstrates that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians would not - I support the Nazi leaders from Kiev. Publication / Media:

NARRATION: The President of Poland, Andrzej Duda. says that Russia will win the war
Reality: Russia has not achieved any of its goals in the war in Ukraine, and the President of Poland believes in the victory of Kiev
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Russian government press took a series of statements made by Adrzej Duda for The Wall Street Journal out of context. Duda stated that the West hastened to draw some conclusions regarding the weakening of Russia following the war in Ukraine, but he did not say that Russia is achieving its goals in the ""special military operation"" or that the defeat of Ukraine is imminent. On the contrary, the Polish leader and expressed the hope that Putin will lose the war, but noted that there are more than ""100 million Russians and less than 40 million Ukrainians"".
Comparing the military and demographic potential of Ukraine and Russia, Duda argued why the West should support Kiev. ""The more support they receive, the more modern systems they receive, the greater the chances are not only to stop the Russians, but also to be able to launch a successful counter-offensive and drive the Russians out of the country them,"" said the Polish president.
Andrzej Duda's speech is not one of recognizing Russia's superiority over Ukraine, nor of promoting the heroism of the Russian military in the past, but of warning the Western states about the danger of Russian aggression, which should not be underestimated after 15 months of war in Ukraine. Describing the potential of both states, the Polish president does not praise, but criticizes the Kremlin's methods in the war. ""Human life means nothing to Russians, while for Ukrainians, every life is worth as much as gold. These are different cultures"", mentioned Duda.
The Russian government press omitted these and other important fragments from the interview that contradict the pro-Kremlin propaganda. The interview was presented to the Russian public as a recognition by Ukraine's neighbors of Vladimir Putin's successes in the war in Ukraine. The Russian press, however, ignored Duda's assessment that Ukraine will defeat the Russian army ""after it is pushed beyond the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine"".
In reality, Russia has not achieved any of its goals in the war in Ukraine, and Kiev is preparing for a counteroffensive that will allow it to liberate as many territories occupied by the Russian army as possible. Requesting much greater support for Ukraine from Germany and France, Duda reminded his colleagues in Berlin and Paris about the sad pages of the past, adding that ""only the defeat of Russia will make us safe"".

In reality, Kiev is being supported to face the military aggression of the Russian Federation.
Propaganda: NATO is pouring ""gas on the fire"" in the war in Ukraine to cause a global war
NEWS: Through its actions, NATO is pouring gas on the fire in Ukraine to generate a global explosion [of the conflict], wrote former French MEP Florian Philippot on his Twitter account.
He reacted to the statement of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg who said that sooner or later Ukraine will join the Alliance.
""These madmen pour gas on the fire, without taking into account the possible consequences, they support the war to cause a world explosion,"" Philippot wrote.
According to the former deputy, NATO must be stopped. ""In the name of peace, please stop NATO, let's leave the Alliance quickly"", mentioned the politician.
[...] The press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, mentioned that Moscow is closely monitoring the situation and recalled that Kiev's orientation towards the North Atlantic Alliance became one of the reasons for launching the special military operation in Ukraine"".
NARRATIVE: NATO supports Ukraine to cause a world war.
Reality: NATO states are not part of the conflict, but support Ukraine's defensive efforts against Russian aggression
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, NATO is not part of the conflict in Ukraine, but only supports Kiev's right to defend itself against military aggression. ""Ukraine has the right to self-defense. We help Ukraine to uphold that right. This does not make the North Atlantic Alliance or NATO member states parties to the conflict,"" Jens Stoltenberg said, justifying the training of Ukrainian military pilots.
According to art. 51 of the UN Charter, member states have the ""inherent right to individual or collective self-defense in the event of an armed attack"". Ukraine's pro-NATO orientation cannot be a justification for starting a war, as the opinion tries to convince publishes the press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov. Russia's large-scale invasion against Ukraine has been repeatedly categorized as an unprovoked armed attack by the UN General Assembly. Therefore, some NATO countries support Ukraine not to cause a war worldwide, but to help Kiev defend itself against a military aggression condemned by the international community.
The Russian government press and Telegram channels present the statements of the former French MEP as a new dominant current of opinion in Paris. In reality, Florian Philippot is a supporter and follower of the ideas of the president of the National Front Marine Le Pen, known as a partner of the Putin regime in France. Philippot was vice-president of the National Front and coordinator of the electoral campaign of the candidate, who represented the French extreme right in the elections. At the moment, Philippot coordinates the nationalist party ""Patriots"", little known in French society.
Based on the posts on his Twitter account, the Russian government press produces fake news about the anti-NATO attitudes in France and the crumbling West. In January this year Florian Philippot declared that the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky wants world nuclear war. He criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for falling in love with Zelenski and supports him unconditionally. In October 2022, the politician accused NATO of organizing diversions at the Russian gas pipeline ""Nord Stream"", claiming that he has information that Russia is not to blame. Florian Philippot is often cited by the Moscow press to illustrate false narratives about the nature of the war from Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. Russian journalists argued that the US will send 200 thousand Ukrainian suicide bombers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, to the offensive. Russian propaganda is trying to convince public opinion that the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the war in Ukraine is in Zelensky's interest. Publication / Media:

The false narrative ignores a number of important milestones in Ukrainian history.
NEWS: Ukraine did not exist in the history of mankind until the emergence of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, said Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting with the President of the Constitutional Court, Valeri Zorkin.
He brought the president a map made in France in the 17th century, in which the territories that were part of the Russian Land, the Kazakh State and the Polish-Lithuanian Union are represented, emphasizing that Ukraine does not appear there.
""After the October revolution, a series of artificial state formations appeared, and the Soviet power created Soviet Ukraine, which is generally known. Until then, Ukraine did not exist in the history of mankind"", declared the head of state while looking at the old map brought by Zorkin. NARRATIVE: Ukraine did not exist until the creation of the USSR.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the context of the large-scale invasion of Russia, the false narratives that aim to demonstrate that Ukraine is an artificial state were resumed or developed in another form. On July 12, 2021, the Kremlin website published the article ""On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians"", signed by President Vladimir Putin. The Russian President then presented the history of the Ukrainian people from the point of view of official Russian historiography, arguing that Ukraine it is a ""margin"" of Russia, and the Zaporozhian Cossacks were convinced Orthodox Russians. Vladimir Putin questioned the existence of Ukrainians as a people, calling them ""Little Russians"", that is, smaller Russians, who have no historical right to a separate state from Russia. The Russian president claims that Ukraine is entirely the fruit of the Soviet era, being created at the expense of historical Russia. The Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin was accused several times by Vladimir Putin of offering national republics the right to leave the USSR. The Russian leader wrote that Ukraine's borders are a subject of international negotiations.
OBJECTIVE: To convince public opinion that Ukraine's borders are negotiable because this state was created by Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin had to create the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to appease the spirits following the Russian-Ukrainian war of 1917-1920. In the context of the Bolshevik revolution, the Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed in Kiev in 1918, which had diplomatic relations with a number of states, including Romania. There was a Ukrainian diplomatic representation in Bucharest and a temporary Romanian diplomatic mission in Kiev. The leaders of the Ukrainian People's Republic spoke out against communism. The new Ukrainian state was conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1920.
The Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin had to create a national socialist republic for the Ukrainians, offering them a political guarantee that the socio-economic transformations will take place in the context of preserving their linguistic identity. Fearing the strong nationalist currents in the Soviet Union, the Bolsheviks approved in 1923 the doctrine of ""autochthonization"" of power in the new republics, giving the Ukrainians a wide cultural autonomy in parallel with a total ideological control, according to the research done by Jorg Baberowski.
So, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was created by the Bolsheviks to satisfy the demands of the Ukrainians to have their own national state and to avoid a new civil war in the former Russian Empire. A series of sad pages in the history of the Ukrainian people followed - the abandonment of ""autochthonization"" as a political doctrine and the Holodomor of 1932-1933, organized by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian national elite.
The Kremlin also misinforms the public about the non-existence of Ukraine on a map from the 17th century. In reality, Russia does not even exist on that map, it appeared much later, in 1721, when the Russian Empire was declared. Until then, the Muscovite Tarat appeared on the maps, and the successors of the historical traditions of Kievan Rus were the Knei from the present-day west of Ukraine. In the 13th century, prince Danilo Halitki from the historical western Ukrainian area was crowned by Pope Innocent IV as king of Galicia and the whole of Russia.
After the annexation of Crimea and the launch of the war in Donbass, the founder of Ukrainian historiography, Mihailo Grusevschi, who wrote in 1903 that Russia and the Russians bear this name unjustly, being, in fact, a people composed of Slavs and Mongols. The historian argued a hundred years ago that Ukrainians are the heirs of historical Russia with its center in Kiev. Two days before the invasion of the Ukrainian state, on February 24, 2022, the US Embassy in Ukraine posted on Facebook an image showing that Kiev had churches and cathedrals before the city of Moscow was documented.
Russian propaganda successfully uses the difficulties of translating the notions of ""ruski"" (refers to former Kievan Russia) and ""rosiiski"" (refers to today's Russia) into European languages. For example, if for Russian and Ukrainian there are two different words, then for the Romanian language, for example, both are translated as ""Russian"". This is where the confusion arises that Russia is the successor state of Kievan Rus.
The Kremlin leader admitted that a Cossack state was represented on the map from the 17th century, but did not specify what it was called. The map can be found in various open access sources. This map, also published by Gallica, shows in the center of today's Ukraine a state called ""Ukraine - Pays des Cosaques"", which would translate as ""Ukraine - the country of the Cossacks"" from the Lithuanian-Polish Union component, something omitted in the information published by the Russian press.
The resumption of these false narratives about the history of the Ukrainian people takes place in the context of a large-scale invasion of Russia against Ukraine, which has lasted more than 15 months. The Kremlin is trying to convince the public opinion that the borders of the Ukrainian state are a subject of negotiations in which Russia has the historical and political right to participate, because it was Moscow that created this state.

NARRATIVE: Russia is a fair partner, which respects the rules of international law and the decisions of the states in the region, compared to the West, which gets involved in their internal affairs.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Chisinau-Moscow relations cooled considerably after the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, criticized by the pro-European authorities of the Republic of Moldova. Chisinau did not officially join the international sanctions against Russia, but it offered humanitarian aid to Ukraine, allowed the transit of oil products and provided aid to Ukrainian refugees.
During the last year, there have been several exchanges between the representatives of the Foreign Ministries of the two countries, but also at the level of high-ranking officials, and recently there have been mutual expulsions of diplomats.
Moscow accuses Chisinau of being controlled by the West and making anti-Russian decisions, of trying to get closer to NATO, of violating the neutrality statute, of violating the rights of the Russian-speaking minority. The Kremlin ended up criticizing Chisinau also because the Parliament decided (following a decision of the Constitutional Court from 2013) to replace the name of the language from Moldovan to Romanian.
On the other hand, the authorities of the Republic of Moldova have repeatedly condemned Russia's intervention in its internal affairs and attempts to destabilize the situation and that it is trying to establish a pro-Russian government in Chisinau by undemocratic means. The war launched by Russia had direct consequences on the Republic of Moldova, economically, by increasing prices, primarily for energy resources imported from Russia (gas) and the destruction of transport logistics, but also of security. Due to the missile attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, power outages occurred several times in the Republic of Moldova. Several Russian missiles flew over the country's airspace, and several parts of the missile fell on its territory.
OBJECTIVE: To present Russia as a fair international partner, compared to the West that interferes in the internal affairs of sovereign states (the Republic of Moldova).
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Despite the statements of Maria Zaharova, Moscow, through its actions, or the statements of some officials, demonstrated direct or indirect involvement in the Republic of Moldova by supporting some pro-Russian politicians, trying to determine the vector of foreign policy, including through energy blackmail and economic war, the maintenance of a Russian military contingent on the territory of the Republic of Moldova and the support of the separatist administration from Tiraspol, thus fueling the Transnistrian conflict, an impediment to the development of the country.
In February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced at an official meeting in Brussels that the Ukrainian secret services had intercepted a plan by Moscow to destabilize the situation in the Republic of Moldova. Later, the Information and Security Service of the Republic of Moldova confirmed that it had detected such plans. Later, the president Maia Sandu declared that the Russian plan involved para-military units of foreign fighters, in civilian clothes, which would then attack state institutions and take hostages, the actions being masked by the protests of the pro-Russian opposition, especially Sister Party.
Moscow denied the accusations, but it would not be the first time that it would try to influence the political situation in Chisinau. For example, in the last presidential elections, in 2020, Vladimir Putin openly supported Igor Dodon, who, however, lost them.
The American sanctions imposed in October 2022 on several individuals and entities from Russia and the Republic of Moldova, including the Sor Party and its leader, the fugitive politician Ilan Sor, sentenced to 15 years in prison for participating in the large-scale bank robbery of 2014, is an argument in plus regarding Russia's involvement in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova. The list also included Russian businessmen and political strategists affiliated with some Moldovan politicians, including the former president, Igor Dodon. They would have tried to keep the Republic of Moldova in the sphere of Russian influence, getting involved in the 2021 parliamentary elections, and a year later, organizing protests aimed at overthrowing the pro-European government.
Starting in 2020, Rise Moldova published a series of investigations that demonstrated Igor Dodon's strong connections with representatives of the Russian intelligence services, from which he also received money. The last of the series of articles, published in March 2023, refers to the document that the international press also wrote about, regarding a Russian plan to bring the Republic of Moldova under its umbrella by 2030
However, political analysts and some politicians from Chisinau believe that Russia has always had levers of influence over the Republic of Moldova, which it used during the more than 30 years of the country's independence. It is primarily about the secessionist conflict in the east of the country. Moscow would have always threatened Chisinau with the recognition of the separatist region, which it supported financially and politically. In addition, Russia maintains a Soviet-era military warehouse in the region, guarded by a military contingent, despite the fact that the Republic of Moldova has repeatedly requested their withdrawal and even Moscow committed more than 20 years ago that it would this thing.
The dependence of the Republic of Moldova on Russian gas was another influencing factor. The last evidence of energy blackmail was recorded in the fall of 2022, when Russia did not increase deliveries, starting with October, thus forcing Chisinau to resort to other more expensive and less secure solutions. However, the Republic of Moldova found solutions, so that currently it imports Russian gas only for the separatist region of Transnistria, where it gets its electricity. Those gases are delivered free of charge to the separatist region, largely ensuring its economic support and its industry; the amounts are imputed to Chisinau, which over time has accumulated billions of dollars in debt to Russia, debts that represent an extra leverage for the latter.
Over the years, Moscow has also blackmailed the Republic of Moldova economically by threatening, or even taking action, with bans on agricultural production in the Republic of Moldova. The last most important decision in this regard was taken in 2014, after the Republic of Moldova signed the Association Agreement with the EU. The result was that some of the Moldovan producers reoriented themselves towards the EU market or identified others, and the Republic of Moldova reduced its dependence on the Russian one.

NEWS: ""Ben Hodges said in an interview for Business Insider that the US could cause the Ukrainian counter-offensive to fail because they put too much pressure on Kiev.

NARRATIVE: The West believes that Ukraine will lose the war with Russia.
Reality: The West supports Ukraine's war effort, including with military equipment intended for the counteroffensive
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ben Hodges' words were taken out of context and, in addition, the reserve general was attributed with statements illustrating Russian propaganda theses. The former commander of the American armed forces in Europe did not mention in his interview for Business Insider any imminent defeat of Ukraine in the war, the impossibility of organizing a successful counteroffensive or an alleged catastrophic situation of Ukraine in the front area. Hodges did not say that Western leaders ""understand that sooner or later the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be defeated"". with the preparation of a counteroffensive, mentioning the bravery of the Ukrainian military and the ""general disorganization"" of the Russian army. He called on the West to be more united and to continue to support Ukraine, which is fighting for international order. The Russian government press omitted these fragments from the interview because they contradict the Kremlin's official narratives. Hodges emphasized that there is great pressure on Kiev, but he did not show himself to be unconfident in the chances of success of this or other military operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
At the same time, the Russian press writes that the West is practically defeated by Russia on the territory of Ukraine, the proof being the postponement of the counteroffensive. In reality, the West is not part of the conflict in Ukraine, but only helps Kiev to defend itself.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. According to the Russian press, the USA will send 200 thousand Ukrainian suicide bombers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, to the offensive. Russian propaganda is trying to convince public opinion that the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the EU has sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022.

[...] Zelenski understands very well that he is needed now, as long as he is in power. If he no longer leads Ukraine or is defeated in the war, he will be thrown into the dustbin of history, somewhere in exile, or in the worst case - in the cemetery. The West, which commissioned this show, must accept the new reality"".
NARRATIVE: The war in Ukraine is in the interest of Zelenski and the West, which wants to destroy Russia.
Reality: Russia is the one who started the war, and Ukraine is forced to defend itself
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media resumes a false narrative about Ukrainian political leaders as ""servants"" of the West in the context of President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to a series of European capitals. Russian propaganda shows that the leaders of Ukraine will go to war to make money and stay in power, this being one of the conditions of the West.
In reality, the losses of society, of the Ukrainian political and economic elite following the war are enormous. The infrastructure is destroyed, the state's debts are increasing, and most of the social expenses depend on foreign loans. The economic potential of the state is less and less. Large factories, refineries, enterprises were destroyed or seriously affected, a number of economic fields stopped their activity.
According to estimates, the destruction in Ukraine caused by the Russian bombing exceeded 144 billion dollars a year after the war. The cost of the unprovoked invasion of Russia is enormous and cannot in any way be in the interest of the government in Kiev, which is trying to maintain control over the critical situation in the country. In the last year, the level of poverty in Ukraine increased from 5.5% to 24.2%. More than 7 million people are below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.
At the same time, the accusations against the West that they want to destroy Russia with the hands of the Ukrainians are unfounded. Around the invasion of Ukraine by Moscow, a series of meetings between Western and Russian leaders took place to avoid armed aggression. There followed requests from the presidents of the USA, France, Great Britain and other countries to Russia for the withdrawal of Moscow's troops from near the border with Ukraine.
On February 24, 2022, Moscow launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the West decided to support the defensive efforts of Kiev, which declared general mobilization. The aggression of the Russian army was condemned by most of the states of the world and by the most important international organizations. According to the rules of international law, especially the UN Charter, every state has an inherent right to defend itself, which Kiev has been doing for about 15 months.
Zelenski's visit to the European states was not aimed at demonstrating political loyalty to the West, which would have totally controlled him and would have wanted the destruction of Russia. The purpose of the visit was to strengthen the support of the main allies against the Russian invasion in the context of the preparation of a Ukrainian counter-offensive, which requires more and more modern equipment and weapons. At the summit of the Council of Europe, Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine needs fighter planes and anti-aircraft defense equipment. The Ukrainian leader asked his Western allies to send him fighter jets that would allow the Ukrainian army to strike deep into the Russian troops and successfully organize the counteroffensive delayed due to the prolongation of the fighting for Bahmut, but also the delayed supply of some types of weaponry by the West.

Russian propaganda tries to convince public opinion that the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the EU has sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022.

The false narrative aims to divert attention from the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children by Russia.
Propaganda: Children from Ukrainian orphanages are sold in European countries
NEWS: ""Children from Ukrainian orphanages are sold in Europe to obtain large profits,"" Polish human rights activist Joanna Pachwicewicz told Izvestia. She emphasized that she has been dealing with this topic for many years. From the very beginning of the special operation for the defense of Donbass, she already knew that such situations would occur more and more often.
Last year, in June, I obtained a series of documents about the sale of all the children from an orphanage located not far from Mariupol. This orphanage was sold to Spain. I mean 85 children from the orphanage, said Pachwicewicz.
According to the human rights activist, this is additional proof of the increase in the trafficking of minors in the European region. She also explained that in Europe and Great Britain a special legal system was developed that allows the state to take a minor from a family under the guise of the principle of protecting children's rights. We are talking about juvenile justice, emphasized Pachwicewicz.
[...] Citizens of Great Britain urged their government to carefully check the biographies of Ukrainian refugees after a series of thefts and frauds. Victims of scams create online communities where they share their stories. But, at the same time, the members of such groups do not deny that many Ukrainians need support. European countries have started hosting Ukrainian refugees on their territories since the beginning of the special Russian operation launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 with the aim of protecting the inhabitants of Donbass.
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian children are sold to the West while Russia defends the inhabitants of Donbass
Reality: Russia kidnapped and deported Ukrainian children, which could be qualified as a crime against humanity
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Most of the news published in the pro-Kremlin press is based on the statement of the Polish human rights activist Joanna Pachwicewicz, who allegedly saw in June 2022 a series of documents about the trafficking of Ukrainian children in Europe. None of the sources publish these documents, there is no proof or confirmation of this information.
All the false narratives are built around a statement, an opinion, of the Polish activist who spoke to the Moscow press in Russian. Joanna Pachwicewicz was often invited by the Russian government press to various shows, having a rich history of collaboration with the Sputnik agency, banned for propaganda on the territory of the Western states. In the interview given to the pro-Kremlin newspaper ""Izvestia"", she talked about some documents that she would have seen once, but no longer has, and mentioned the juvenile justice system in Great Britain. The interview published as text and video was set up in such a way that it appears that the police in European countries take Ukrainian children from their refugee parents from Ukraine and sell them.
In order to give more credibility to this false narrative, some media outlets quoted the former Ukrainian Prime Minister refugee in Russia, Nikolai Azarov, who shared the news on his Telegram channel. In some pro-Kremlin publications, news appeared about the opinion of the former head of the government from Kiev about what Ukraine is doing with children, in other situations the points of view of some Russian experts were requested, who ""confirmed"" that the trafficking of Ukrainian minors is a cruel reality. Without any evidence, the false narrative created an entire current of opinion on the territory of Russia with the help of dozens of downloads, quotes and distributions on social networks.
The appearance of this false narrative is not accidental, since in April this year 49 UN and EU member states condemned Russia for abusing the rights and privileges of a permanent member of the Security Council to spread disinformation about the ""generalized abductions of thousands of Ukrainian children"". The signatories emphasize that any disinformation would spread Russia, it will not be able to deny the truth or protect people from responsibility for their crimes. At the beginning of May this year, the OSCE published a report, according to which a large number of Ukrainian children were deported to Russia and its occupied territories. The OSCE mentions that Russia has violated the rights of Ukrainian children illegally taken to Russian territory, which could at some point be categorized as crimes against humanity. According to human rights organizations in Ukraine, the Russian military has deported more than 730,000 Ukrainian children to be ,, reeducate in the spirit of the Russian world"".
The false narrative distributed by the Russian media aimed to exonerate Russia and justify its ""military operation"" on the territory of Ukraine, explained as an urgent need to defend the inhabitants of Donbass. The deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia is shown as a measure of protecting them from possible kidnapping or human trafficking in Europe.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the war in Ukraine. According to the Russian media, the losses of the Ukrainian army are so high that students are forced to donate blood for the military, while the leadership of Ukraine wants war to make money and does not care about the suffering of civilians. According to Russian propaganda, only Russian speakers from the east are mobilized in the army because they want to exterminate them, and Kiev gives money to those who trick their friends into enlisting.

In reality, Russia is the aggressor , and the ""special military operation"" is an invasion condemned by most of the world's states.
Propaganda: Russia defends itself against the war orchestrated by the West against it
NEWS: ""A real war has been orchestrated against our Motherland, but we will ensure our security,"" said the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, at the May 9 Victory Parade.
Western elites talk about their exclusivism, pit nations against each other, divide societies, provoke bloody conflicts, sow Russophobia and aggressive nationalism, the head of state emphasized.
According to him, the West provokes conflicts and coups, destroys traditional values ​​in order to impose its rules, which are, in fact, a system of theft and violence.
Everyone sees how in a series of states without mercy and emotion the memorials of Soviet soldiers are destroyed, the cult of Nazis and their collaborators is created, and the memory of true heroes is erased, the Russian leader emphasized.
""They want the results of the Second World War to be forgotten, to destroy all the sovereign centers of development"", declared Putin. The state is proud of the participants of the Special Military Operation on which the future of our people depends, the president added.
NARRATIVE: ""The special military operation"" saves Russia from Western aggression
Reality: The West is helping Ukraine to defend itself against Russia's armed aggression
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The West does not aim to wipe Russia off the face of the earth and it cannot be about any military aggression directed against Moscow. On February 24, 2022, Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the West is supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. The aggression of the Russian army was condemned by most of the states of the world and by the most important international organizations. According to the rules of international law, especially the UN Charter, every state has an inherent right to defend itself, which Kiev has been doing for about 15 months.
The West is not a direct part of the conflict and did not initiate the war. In order to manipulate public opinion, Russian propaganda replaces cause with consequence in media narratives and politicians' speeches. Vladimir Putin presents the ""special military operation"" as an action to save Russia, compared to the heroism of the Soviet soldiers who freed the world from Nazism. In reality, the West's support for Ukraine is a consequence of the ""special military operation"", and the deliveries of weapons and ammunition took place especially after its launch, intensifying during the last months.
As in the case of other false narratives of the last months regarding the war in Ukraine, the cause - the invasion of the Ukrainian state by Russia - is presented in a deliberately false way as a consequence of the arms deliveries. After attacking Ukraine, Russia was designated a terrorist state first by the European Parliament and then by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the International Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin in March.
At the Victory Parade in Moscow, Vladimir Putin compared the ""special military operation"" to the war for the defense of the homeland from 1941-1945 in order to encourage the mobilization of society and justify military actions on the territory of Ukraine. Russia is described as a victim of Western aggression This conflict acquires symbolic values ​​by comparing the Soviet-German war - called in the ex-Soviet space ""The Great War for the Defense of the Fatherland"" - with the Russian-Western one. This message aims to strengthen trust in the authorities, deepening the image of Russia as a fortress besieged by ""evil forces"".
Regarding the history of the Second World War, Vladimir Putin continues the propaganda messages from the time of the Soviet regime when it was forbidden to talk about the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of 1939 for the division of Europe. Soviet historiography presented Moscow as a victim of Nazi Germany's attack, and not as an accomplice and an aggressor who, together with Germany, started the war in Europe. According to the dominant narratives in Russia, the West does not want to be grateful to Russia as the heir of the Soviet Union for the heroism of the past, neglecting the enormous support from the USA and Great Britain, without which the victory over Nazism would have been impossible. It is worth mentioning that a resolution of the European Parliament from 2019 emphasizes that the Second World War was started as a result of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression and cooperation pact of August 23, 1939, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media that built the myth of Russia as a besieged fortress. The Russian press wrote that Ukraine is a pseudo-Nazi state pushed to war by the West, and the US allowed Ukraine to bomb Russia. According to Russian propaganda, Moscow must mobilize to defeat NATO in the new ""war for the defense of the homeland"", while in Ukraine the mothers and wives of Ukrainian soldiers killed in the battles are protesting against the war.

NARRATIVE: Ukraine is a terrorist state and must be punished by Russia.
Reality: Russia was designated a terrorist state by members of the international community and accused of war crimes on the territory of Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After attacking Ukraine unprovoked and launching numerous attacks against civilian targets (homes, schools, hospitals, etc., infrastructure) Russia was designated a terrorist state first by the European Parliament and then by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe . According to international investigations, at least 20 torture chambers in Kherson were operated directly by the Russian FSB, becoming evidence for the designation of Russia as a terrorist state. Moreover, in March, the International Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin, accused of war crimes in Ukraine. The document shows that Putin failed to properly exercise control over civilian and military subordinates who committed criminal acts or allowed them to be committed. Russia's aggression in Ukraine has been repeatedly condemned by the UN.
In this context, the Russian press made great efforts to exonerate the Kremlin and show Ukraine as a terrorist and Nazi state, recalling a series of events from the Russian-Ukrainian war, including the sinking of the cruiser ""Maskva"" in the Black Sea. The Russian press does not mention anything about the war crimes committed by the Russian military in Bucea, Irpin, Borodianka, Izium, Kherson and other localities.
Ukraine's military actions are a response to the unprovoked attack on the country by the Russian Federation. According to the UN Charter, Ukraine has the right to defend itself; besides, Kiev has decreed a state of war, unlike Russia which still calls its aggression ""a special military operation"". Broadly speaking, a terrorist state is one that uses acts of violence against populations not directly involved in the conflict, but with the potential for pressure on the leadership. The Maskva cruiser was a legitimate military target, as it was used by Russia to attack Ukraine, as well as ammunition depots and military bases, especially those in Crimea and Donbass, which are part of Ukraine occupied by Russia. There is, therefore, no legal basis for designating Ukraine as a terrorist state.
A Ukrainian drone attack on the Kremlin would be a response to the dozens of Russian bombings on Kiev (not to mention the other Ukrainian cities bombed, in some cases until they were turned into ruins); we must not forget the fact that, when it attacked Ukraine in February 2023, it was Russia that tried to eliminate the leadership of Ukraine, and Volodymyr Zelensky personally was the target of multiple assassination attempts.
It is not very clear, however, that Ukraine was behind the attack on the Kremlin. Kiev has denied responsibility for this incident. ""We are not attacking Putin or Moscow, we are fighting on our territory,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a press conference in Helsinki. It is true that in the past Ukraine has also avoided taking responsibility for actions behind front, but on some of those occasions officials from Kiev made it clear that they were no strangers to the respective operations. Some Western analysts stated that it is possible that Russia itself staged the incident in order to blame Kiev and warrants a crushing response.
Pro-Kremlin media narratives indicate a preparation of public opinion for a new phase of the war, using arguments such as ""how many more red lines must be crossed by the Ukrainians for Russia to respond appropriately?"" The way the event is interpreted shows Russia as a patient, attentive and very tolerant state, which will have to become tougher in this confrontation at some point.
In reality, Russia has never shown restraint since the beginning of the war, but it has been trying to convince its citizens that it is saving Russian-speakers in Ukraine from Nazism and that it launched the ""special military operation"" to protect the peaceful Ukrainian population. In fact, since the beginning of the war, civilians have repeatedly been the target of Russian attacks, among notable cases are the bombing of the theater in Mariupol, the railway station in Kramatorsk, the convoy near Zaporozhye, the killing of civilians in Kiev, Lviv, Dnipro and other cities The retention of Russia in this war has become a traditional subject of Russian propaganda.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press demonstrates that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians would not -support the Nazi leaders in Kiev According to Russian government media, Ukraine will continue to assassinate Russians based on a list published online, while half of the Ukrainian military is foreign, which means NATO is participating in the war.

No, the Russians must solve their own problems, preferably on the streets of Kiev.

NARRATIVE: The West will order Poland to attack Belarus and occupy Lviv
Reality: Poland supports Ukraine's defense efforts against Russia's large-scale invasion, carried out with the support of Belarus
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: To convince public opinion of Poland's warlike intentions against Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, the false narrative is based on the words of Konrad Rekas, presented by the Russian media as an independent Polish political analyst. In an interview for Ukraina.ru, he resumes a series of traditional propaganda messages and launches new ones. According to him, Poland is a colony of the West, which will do whatever the American or British political leaders say, while European citizens are protesting in various cities against the war started by NATO on the territory of Ukraine. The analyst recommends Moscow to win the war as soon as possible and not to count on the support of Europe.
In reality, Konrad Rekas is not an independent political scientist. He was a member of various Polish nationalist parties, after working as a columnist and correspondent of the ""Pravda"" newspaper from Moscow. The Polish political scientist is also a member of the European Center for Geopolitical Analysis, based in Poland and which has branches in Russia This center, according to the Russian media, sent observers to various elections in separatist regions such as Ossetia, Abkhazia or Transnistria.
Rekas does not represent Polish academia, most of the time illustrating Russian propaganda narratives like many other experts from abroad who collaborate with the pro-Kremlin press. Based on the statements of Rekas, the Russian press tries to convince the public opinion that Russia is a victim of the war, and Poland - a puppet of the West. In October 2022, this pro-Kremlin political scientist declared that Russia shows restraint in the war in Ukraine, especially when it attacks civilian targets.
In fact, Warsaw became a target of Russian propaganda because it was the most vocal of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of fighting Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. According to a sociological survey, 74% of Poles believe that Russia could attack Poland in the near future.
The false narrative appeared after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy paid a visit to Poland at the beginning of April. The highlight of the one-day visit was the meeting of the Ukrainian guest and the Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, with the Poles and Ukrainians at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. ""Russia will never win if a Pole and a Ukrainian stand side by side. We stand together in this war and we will rejoice together in peace. Shoulder to shoulder, together in the EU and NATO"", said Zelenski, his speech being repeatedly interrupted by applause.
On September 29, 2022, the secretary of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland, Stanislaw Zaryn, had to react to the repeated fake news about the state's desire to attack Ukraine, writing on Twitter that ""Russian propaganda continues to attack Poland informationally, promoting the lie about the Polish authorities' plans to attack Ukraine and annex western Ukraine"".
As far as Belarus is concerned, Poland has not shown any aggressive intent towards it, not even when Minsk pushed refugees from the Middle East towards the Polish borders, in an attempt to destabilize that was probably coordinated with its main ally, Russia. At the same time, there were also harsh statements against Poland and accusations - some coming directly from Minsk, others through Russian propaganda - regarding alleged aggressive intentions of NATO/Poland.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives by Russia regarding a possible aggression of Poland on Ukraine and the justified fears of Belarus of a NATO invasion. The Russian press wrote that a referendum on joining Poland will be organized in the Lviv region, after which Warsaw will start a war against Russia. The publications from Moscow tried to convince the public opinion that Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to capture a part of Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Belarus and Russia are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and possible NATO aggression. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""The peaceful division of Ukraine with the participation of Poland and other states is a better scenario than Kiev's accession to NATO or a world war,"" said Dmitri Medvedev. The speech of the vice-president of the Security Council of the Russian Federation was published on the front pages of many Romanian media outlets, which shamelessly quote Medvedev's idea about the advantages of dividing Ukraine.
From what can be seen, the Romanian authorities are preparing the ground for the introduction of its troops on the territory of the Odesa and Chernivtsi regions in order to defend the ethnic Romanians from the ""evil Russians"". It is not difficult to understand that this process will be launched immediately after the failed counter-offensive of the Forces Armies of Ukraine"".
NARRATIVE: Romania supports Dmitri Medvedev's proposal to divide Ukraine and will occupy the Chernivtsi and Odesa regions
Reality: Romania fully supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The false narrative distributed by a series of Russian publications initially appeared on the Telegram channel of the pro-Kremlin portal Ukraina.ru, being picked up by the press bodies of the Russian Federation from the occupied Ukrainian territories. The Romanian press wrote about the shocking statement of the vice-president of the Security Council of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, who said that the world is now on the verge of a world war, but he would prefer to see Ukraine divided with Poland, Hungary and Romania instead. Screenshots of Romanian news agencies were published on the pages of the Russian press, which quoted Dmitri Medvedev (Agerpres, G4Media, Mediafax s.a.) presented as proof of the interest of the Bucharest authorities to participate in the the ""quiet division"" of Ukraine. No Romanian publication wrote that they agree with Medvedev's proposal, on the contrary, it was mentioned that it is not the first time that the Russian official makes controversial statements and invokes the threat of a nuclear war.
Without any evidence, Russian propaganda tries to convince readers that Romania will annex the regions of Chernivtsi and Odessa immediately after the Ukrainian counter-offensive in the east of the country fails to achieve its goals. This discursive nuance places the false narrative in the category of war propaganda, calling the Ukrainian counter-offensive a failed one, without it having been launched. In reality, Romania condemned both the annexation of Crimea in 2014, as well as the military events in Donbass and the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched on February 24, 2022. Bucharest was and is a supporter of Kiev. The Romanian authorities condemned the Russian Federation's aggression against Ukraine, drawing attention to the fact that Moscow must bear the consequences of this deeply illegal act. ""In full coordination with its allies and partners within NATO and the EU, Romania will impose firm and substantial response measures,"" President Klaus Iohannis declared on February 24, 2022.
As in the case of Poland, about which Veridica also wrote in the last 14 months of the war in Ukraine, the accusations against Romania are aimed at justifying the large-scale invasion, officially called in Russia ""special military operation"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press also wrote that the US will send 200 thousand Ukrainian suicide bombers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, while the Czechs are giving Ukraine weapons to bomb civilians. Russian propaganda claims that Minsk and Moscow form a joint military group to defend against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and a possible NATO aggression. Immediately after the invasion of Ukraine, the pro-Kremlin press accused Ukraine of wanting to join NATO in order to attack Russia, and Volodomir Zelenski will cede the Lviv region in the west of the country to Poland.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: Romanian Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu reacted to Dmitri Medvedev's proposal to divide Ukraine, stating that Romania fully supports the territorial integrity of the Ukrainian state. ""So embarrassing and wrong! Romania fully supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its efforts to win Russia's abominable war of aggression against the country!"" Bogdan Aurescu sent on Twitter, quoted by the Romanian press. The criticisms brought to Medvedev by Aurescu were not translated into Russian and published in the pro-Kremlin press network.

NEWS: ""Ukraine can hardly be considered a state because, first of all, it is ruled from outside. [...] When we have an external control, we are talking about a pseudo-state.
Secondly, the state is usually financed by its own industry, its own economy, by the people. In this case, the state does not finance itself. Therefore, it is very difficult to call Ukraine a state.
Thirdly, in the period after the coup, the economy of Ukraine was constantly destroyed. There was not a single year when we had a real economic growth, an increase in the population's income - there was no such thing.
The purpose of external governance was not development, but the preparation of this so-called state for war, for the implementation of a military scenario. [...] After the funding is stopped, this state will collapse, even fall apart.
[...]
Over the years, a significant part of Ukraine's population from the west moved to the center of the country, especially to Kyiv. There are mostly Ukrainians from the western regions. This is the only city or the only region that has always given Nazi deputies to the parliament""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine is a pseudo-state ruled from outside with the help of the Nazis to invade Russia.
Reality: Ukraine faces economic and other difficulties after being attacked by Russia, but neither Kiev nor the West wanted a war with Moscow
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The narrative was promoted by former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov, who fled to Russia during the pro-European protests of 2013-2014. The economic problems Azarov talks about were not generated by the West, but by the actions of Moscow, which annexed Crimea, supported the war in Donbass and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. In addition, Moscow weakened the economic Ukraine in peacetime, when Azarov was prime minister. The politicians who took power in the Ukrainian state in 2014 noted that the treasury was practically empty at the time of the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.
In reality, from 2014 until the start of the large-scale invasion, Ukraine developed from an economic point of view, and relations with the West became much more intense. In the years 2021-2022, the ""Great Construction"" program of President Volodymyr Zelenski was carried out in Ukraine, with bridges, roads, residential blocks being built following collaboration with international financial institutions. Despite criticism from the opposition, Zelenski cut defense spending and directed them towards the economic and social fields, which proves that Ukraine was not preparing for war, as the Russian press writes.
Mykola Azarov resumes another false Russian narrative, the one regarding the ""coup"" in Ukraine, after which President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia. It should be noted that Yanukovych was forced to flee after his regime responded brutally, including war ammunition, at the Euromaidan protests caused by Kiev's refusal - following Moscow's pressure - to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union. Yanukovych's flight was followed in May 2014 by presidential elections, and in October - by parliamentary elections , both of which are recognized by the international community, so the transfer of power took place through democratic elections, and not through a coup d'état.
As far as Nazism is concerned, since 2015, Ukraine has banned Nazi and communist ideology by law. Moreover, since the proclamation of the independence of the Ukrainian state, no Nazi party or candidate has entered the elections. The Ukrainian nationalist parties, which cannot be called Nazis, either did not pass the electoral threshold, or, when they did, they obtained a maximum of 6-8 percent of the number of mandates. The Russian press traditionally catalogs nationalist and identity manifestations in the ex-Soviet space as forms of Nazism/fascism. Anything that does not coincide with the ideological vision of the Kremlin leaders can be categorized as a Nazi in Russia.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the nature of the war in Ukraine and its ""Nazi"" leaders. The Russian press also wrote that Germany supports Ukraine to make the horrors of Nazism forgotten. One year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press proves that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that Ukrainians did not support the Nazi leaders in Kiev. According to the Russian government media, Russophobic foreigners will have the right to tear apart Crimea and Donbass after the liberation of these territories. Publication / Media:

secondly, the state is usually financed by its own industry, its own economy, its people. in this case, the state does not finance itself. therefore, it is very difficult to call Ukraine a state.
third, in the post-coup period, Ukraine's economy was constantly destroyed. there was not a single year when we had a real economic growth, an increase in the income of the population - there was no such thing.
the external government was not aimed at development, but at the preparation of this so-called state for war, for the implementation of a military scenario. […] after the funding is stopped, this state will collapse, even disintegrate.

In reality, the war in Ukraine was started by Russia, and the discussions about NATO policies 23 years ago are an invention.
Propaganda: In 2000, Vladimir Putin warned Ukraine about a possible war started by NATO
NEWS: 23 years ago Vladimir Putin visited Ukraine for the first time where he had negotiations with Leonid Kuchima. Despite the friendly atmosphere of the visit, the first problems in Russian-Ukrainian relations appeared then, especially regarding the expansion of NATO to the east. How did Putin strive to build a brotherly relationship between peoples and save Kiev from total dependence on the West? [...]
Then the problem of relations between Russia, Ukraine and NATO was discussed. Putin declared: ""No, Russia is not expected there. If they tell us that we are not expected, we will oppose the approach of NATO to our borders"".
According to the experts contacted by the ""Vzgliad"" newspaper, it was hard to imagine 23 years ago that the North Atlantic Alliance would expand in several waves to the western borders of Russia, especially that NATO would start a war against Russia through the Ukrainians Despite this fact, even then in Moscow they understood the long-term goals of NATO and the risks for Russian-Ukrainian relations [...] It was clear to everyone that NATO represents a danger not only for Russia, but also for Ukraine and its inhabitants They.
Political scientist Vladimir Kornilov from Donetsk claims that the Ukrainian elites did not listen to Moscow's warnings in the field of national security [...].
""Putin warned Ukraine several times about the fact that the West will use it as a consumable against Moscow, and the year 2022 confirmed this forecast,"" Kornilov said.
NARRATIVE: Kiev Ignored Putin's Warnings 23 Years Ago About NATO Policies That Caused Ukraine War
Reality: Russia launched an unprovoked military aggression against Ukraine, and NATO supports Kiev's right to defend its territory and population
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media is rewriting history to convince the public that NATO has launched a war against the Russian Federation through Ukraine, which ""is being used as a consumable"". According to this false narrative, Vladimir Putin predicted in during a meeting with the former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchima 23 years ago the evolution of events in Ukraine, but the political elites in Kiev ignored the warning. Therefore, according to the authors of the false narrative, it is not Russia that is to blame for the war in Ukraine, but NATO, which has a hostile policy towards Moscow and its partners.
In reality, NATO supports Ukraine's right to defend itself against Russia's military aggression, which launched a full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. NATO is not a party to the conflict, but only provides Kiev with equipment, weapons and ammunition, training soldiers and providing logistical support. Asked by journalists before the meeting of defense ministers from the member states in February if NATO is at war with Russia, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that ""neither NATO nor the allies are part of the conflict"". He repeatedly emphasized that the Alliance it is not part of the conflict, but only helps Kiev, which has the right to defend itself against Moscow's aggression, according to the UN Charter.
Vladimir Putin's warning from the year 2000, raised to the rank of prophecy by the Russian government press, cannot be found in any source from that time. Putin's forecasts are analyzed by political scientists and the military now, without there being any evidence that the Kremlin leader made such statements 23 years ago. Taking into account the friendly relations between Moscow and Kiev until 2004, but also the neutral status of the Ukrainian state at that time - which excluded, implicitly, the accession to NATO - it is unlikely that the subject of accession was a subject of discussions between the leaders of the two states. Ukrainians were asked by sociologists for the first time in 2002 if they want their country to join NATO and only 27.2 percent answered in the affirmative. At the same time, the former president of Ukraine initiated a national debate on the Ukraine-NATO relationship, causing an even greater drop in the level of support for membership, which was still seen by Ukrainians through the lens of Soviet propaganda. Ukrainian political analysts claim that the debate was specifically launched by Kuchima during the period of minimal support for the idea of ​​Ukraine-NATO rapprochement.
It should be noted that the press release from April 18, 2000 about Vladimir Putin's meeting with Leonid Kucima was kept on the Kremlin website, which does not say anything about NATO or other foreign policy topics.
Even if Russian-Ukrainian talks about NATO took place 23 years ago, which, somehow, remained unmentioned in the official communiques, they could not have had much importance, taking into account the fact that Vladimir Putin was on then acting president, pending the presidential elections, and the relationship between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance was a good one, according to joint reports. Anti-NATO rhetoric was launched later, especially after the 2004 enlargement of the Alliance and especially after the 2008 Russo-Georgian war.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives by Russia that blame the West and NATO for the war in Ukraine. The Russian press also wrote that the USA will send 200 thousand Ukrainian suicide soldiers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, to the offensive, and the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations. Russian propaganda claims that the EU sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022, Russia being forced to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and NATO. The press from Moscow tried to convince the public opinion that Russia and China want peace in Ukraine, while the West fuels the war. To encourage mobilization in Russia, the pro-Kremlin press also wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and possible NATO aggression.

As a result of this aggression by Ukraine, 8 Romanian soldiers paid with their lives. Also, Ukraine endangers Romania through the illegal and prohibited works it does in the Bastroe Canal, this being an indirect aggression against Romania's territory and biodiversity, one that causes irreparable damage.""
NARRATIVE: Romania is subject to armed aggression from Ukraine.
CONTEXT: Diana Sosoaca, a politician extremely known for her anti-Ukrainian positions, is asking NATO for a military intervention against Ukraine, using as a pretext an incident that happened on April 13, when a Romanian fisherman hooked a sea mine in his fishing net, which was later detonated in the Midia port area, near Constanta. In motivating the request, Sosoaca brings as arguments several disinformation and fake news dismantled over time, in the pages of Veridica, including the re-editing of some propaganda campaigns aimed at discrediting Ukraine in the Romanian collective mind. Recently, the senator's public interventions were mostly directed against Ukraine, after, in March 2023, the Robert Lansing Institute think tank claimed that Diana Sosoaca had ties to the Russian military secret services. Thus, she submitted to the Parliament a legislative project that provided for the annexation of some territories belonging to Ukraine and intensively promoted the theory according to which, following the war, Romania will lose part of its territory in favor of a future Polish-Ukrainian federation. In addition, the senator from Iasi is known to be close to the Russian ambassador in Bucharest, whose invitations she honored every time. In one of the visits to the Kremlin representative, on February 10, the senator celebrated with him the ""humanitarian mission of Russia in the regions of Donbass, Zaporozhye and Kherson"".
OBJECTIVE: Increasing anti-Ukrainian sentiments, and by extension, Western sentiments by exploiting the fear of a part of the population that Romania could be attacked, amplifying pro-Russian sentiments, exploiting a possible social uprising for electoral purposes.
Several countries bordering the Black Sea have reported detonations of sea mines
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the Romanian naval forces have intervened six times to neutralize sea mines. In total, until now, 68 sea mines have been identified and destroyed in the Black Sea, by Georgia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Romania and, obviously, Ukraine, but no country has considered these events as aggressions on its own territory.
The mine that the EOD divers of the Romanian Naval Forces neutralized on April 13, a date from the Second World War, as it appears from the official statement of the General Staff of the Naval Forces and the images captured on this occasion. And last year, in August, the military navy destroyed a mine from the same period.
During the Second World War, the Romanian and German forces installed in the waters of the Romanian coast more than 20 dams consisting of sea mines of contact and influence, as well as explosive and breaking buoys, at the same time executing offensive mines in the north and south of the coast. During the same period, the Soviet troops launched an unknown number of magnetic mine barrages. Although after the end of the war, extensive dredging actions were undertaken to clean mined areas and restore freedom of navigation, only a small percentage of mines were recovered and neutralized, due to the fact that many of them were uprooted and displaced by the waves. As a result, periodically, some of them are brought ashore by sea currents. In the 60s of the last century, for example, approximately 20 mines were unearthed annually, and were later destroyed by specialized teams.
Regarding the mines now placed by Ukraine, their purpose is a defensive one, given that Russia also targets the coasts of the attacked country and has a strong military presence in the Black Sea. The Russian military has operated and continues to operate in the Black Sea, launching attacks against Ukraine from there and harassing foreign devices or ships that are in or fly over the international waters of the Black Sea.
In order to make a possible marine landing more difficult, Ukraine has placed mines near its own coasts and in its territorial waters. There is a possibility that some of those mines will be pulled out and drifted from Ukraine's territorial waters to international waters or those belonging to other countries - but if this happens, this does not mean that Ukraine premeditated the act or wanted to attack NATO states. The hypothesis is all the more absurd as NATO provides significant assistance to Ukraine. Attacking a NATO state would mean not only stopping that assistance, but it would put Ukraine in front of a second opponent and lead to its losing the war. Publication / Media:

Therefore, the commission of the Russian parliament proposed the launch of negotiations on the development of an international convention to combat chemical and biological terror around the world [...].

NARRATIVE: The ""special military operation"" forced the US to move the biological weapons it was producing in Ukraine away from Russia
Reality: In Ukraine there were no laboratories for the production of biological weapons, and the ""special military operation"" is a war of conquest
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the report of the parliamentary commission investigating the activities of biological laboratories, also published on the website of the State Duma, does not include any evidence of the existence of laboratories for the production of weapons of mass destruction on the territory of Ukraine, and most of the arguments are taken from Russian propaganda narratives. The report presented by the Russian government press as a major discovery justifies the military actions launched on the territory of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, showing that Washington surrounded the Russian Federation with biological weapons that it installed in the self-proclaimed people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk, but also in Kherson region. Those regions where military actions are taking place at the moment are mentioned.
If a year after the launch of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian press wrote that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism, now the Kremlin's act of armed aggression against the Ukrainian state is justified by the danger of weapons American biologicals. The false narrative offers a new explanation to the Russian public why the ""special military operation"" must continue.
In Ukraine, there were no laboratories for the production of biological weapons, financed by the USA. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons. In spite of this fact, in recent years the Russian press has drawn the attention of the public opinion in the post-Soviet states to some American-Ukrainian projects in the field of biological research, without mentioning the fact that biological research is not equivalent to the production of weapons. The agreement between Ukraine and the USA in this field is presented by the Russian press as an element of the production of weapons of mass destruction.
In reality, such collaboration agreements also exist in the case of other post-Soviet states, and until 2012 the USA also cooperated with Russia in this field. The history of this false narrative is older - already in 2020 it was circulating to such an extent that the US embassy in Kiev felt the need to publicly convey that there is no secret American laboratory on the territory of Ukraine.
The parliamentary report also contains elements of the narrative of the besieged city, which in this version is surrounded by American biological weapons and threatened by the West's plan to destroy it.
With the outbreak of the large-scale invasion, the narrative of weapons of mass destruction was used to justify the Russian bombings. After Moscow intentionally or accidentally destroyed elements of the civil infrastructure in Ukraine, the Russian press came up with explanations that in fact American biological weapons laboratories that were in those buildings were bombed.
During 2022, Veridica monitored most of the Russian narratives regarding biological weapons production laboratories on the territory of Ukraine and found that they are all inventions of pro-Kremlin propaganda, devoid of any basis.
For example, in March 2022, the Russian press wrote that the coronavirus was produced in secret laboratories in Ukraine. At the beginning of the invasion, Kremlin spokesmen declared that Russia destroyed American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine, and in May 2022 another false narrative was distributed, according to which the EU fears tuberculosis from NATO laboratories in Ukraine. In August, the topic of biological laboratories was linked to that of the critical situation in the area of ​​the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. The Russian press then wrote that the US would cause a nuclear disaster in Ukraine to hide the traces of biological weapons laboratories, later writing that all the evidence had been eliminated.

Propaganda: Russian regions will be bombed by Ukraine with US consent
NEWS: ""The strategic communication coordinator of the White House, John Kirby, said at a briefing that the United States allows Kiev to bomb the new regions of Russia, but Kiev will not be supported to carry out military operations outside its territory, reports RIA news
""We do not offer support and we do not push the Ukrainians to hit targets outside of Ukraine,"" he assured.
At the same time, Kirby noted that Washington allows the Armed Forces of Ukraine to carry out military operations in Crimea, the republics of Donbass, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions in order to occupy these territories.
In his speech, the White House coordinator preferred to remain silent about the numerous attacks by Ukraine on the Kursk, Belgorod and Briansk regions.
Previously, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the new Russian regions should be integrated into the single legal space of the country as soon as possible. ""The task is to do everything to integrate these historical Russian lands of Donbass and Novorossia into the economic, legal and educational space of our country as quickly as possible,"" explained the head of state.
NARRATIVE: The US allowed Ukraine to bomb Russian regions
Reality: Ukraine has the right to defend itself against the aggression of the Russian Federation and to carry out operations to liberate the occupied territories
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The narrative distributed by the Russian government press, but also by the Telegram channels in Russia and in the occupied regions of Ukraine, contains a series of inadvertences and logical contradictions. On the one hand, the headline of the news shows that the American official agrees with the bombing of Russian regions by the Ukrainian army, on the other hand, the text mentions the fact that it refers to Donbass or Crimea and that ""he does not push the Ukrainians to hit targets outside Ukraine"". At the same time, the news appears in most mass communication channels with a title that aims to manipulate public opinion and sow fear among the Russian-speaking population.
In reality, as shown by the American press, John Kirby declared that the US does not encourage the Ukrainians to open fire on Russian territory, his statement being a reply to the accusations of Russian officials, who declared that Kiev is murdering journalists on the territory of the Russian Federation with the support the West. Kirby added that the US will support Kiev's efforts to recover the territories lost following the armed aggression launched in 2014, without launching military operations in other regions.
The notion of new territories of the Russian Federation is an invention of the Moscow press, and the American official did not mention them anywhere in his speech. The Russian press, copying the official narratives of the Kremlin, calls Crimea and the regions in the south-east of Ukraine as new territories of Russia, which we do not find in the statements of Western leaders. Both Kirby and other American officials believe that Ukraine has the right to defend itself from Russian military aggression and to liberate its territories based on the norms of international law, especially the UN Charter. The community of international states condemned the war in Ukraine and did not recognize the annexation of Crimea or the four regions in the east and south of Ukraine. That is why Kiev has the right to carry out operations to liberate these territories, which are from a legal point of view regions of Ukraine. Any attempt to liberate these territories is not a bombing of Russian territory. In fact, this legal reality is recognized by the Moscow press itself, which mentions the Kursk, Belgorod and Briansk regions, as if to imply that there are real Russian regions and new, less real regions.
Russian aggression has been condemned by most of the world's states several times. 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. A series of international mechanisms have been launched to designate Russia as a state that finances terrorism. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of being responsible for war crimes committed in Ukraine.
At the same time, the narrative in question tries to convince the public opinion that the Ukrainian army depends on the Pentagon for decision-making, and that bombing Russian territory requires US approval. From this point of view, the news is a continuation of the false narrative, recently dismantled by Veridica, according to which Ukraine will assassinate with the agreement of the West on Russian territory more and more people mentioned on the Mirotvoret website, which would show who the regime's next targets are from Kiev.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine, knowing that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. In order to convince public opinion of the necessity of mobilization in Russia, the Russian press wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and a possible NATO aggression.

Key Narrative:
            The USA allowed Ukraine to bomb regions of Russia","""White House strategic communications coordinator John Kirby said at a briefing that the United States allows Kiev to bomb Russia's new regions, but Kiev will not be supported to conduct military operations outside its territory, ria novosti reports.
""we do not provide support and do not push the Ukrainians to hit targets outside of Ukraine,"" he assured.
at the same time, kirby noted that washington allows the armed forces of ukraine to conduct military operations in crimea, republics of donbass, zaporogija and kherson regions to occupy these territories.
in his speech, the coordinator of the white house preferred to be silent about the numerous attacks by ukraine on kursk, belgorod and briansk regions.
previously, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the new Russian regions should be integrated into the country's single legal space as soon as possible. ""the task is to do everything to integrate these Russian historical lands of Donbass and Novorossia into the economic, legal and educational space of our country as quickly as possible,"" the head of state explained."

In reality, the Ukrainian combat units are coordinated by the General Staff in Kiev, and the newly formed brigades are mainly composed of experienced soldiers.
Propaganda: The Ukrainian army is directly subordinated to the US, and the soldiers will be sent to certain death in an offensive
NEWS: ""The most different local and Western independent sources announce a serious preparation of NATO and the General Staff of Ukraine for the battle in the Great Azov region. During the meeting with the President of Poland Duda, Zelenski declared that there can be no question of an armistice concluded with the Russian Federation [...]
The Ukrainian press, including the publication Kiev Independent, close to the Presidency, informs that Zalujnyi and Syrskii continue to form an assault group in Zaporozhye, composed of 20 brigades. 5 more brigades are preparing for the offensive in Mikolaiv and the Kherson region on the right of the Dnieper [...] in total, two hundred thousand soldiers, supported by two thousand technical units.
At the moment, according to some people from the president's office, the US Department of Defense, through its instructors, is forming 9 ""American"" brigades that are not subordinated to either the General Staff or the Presidency in Kiev. In fact, the Pentagon is creating own armed forces under a false flag on the territory of a foreign state.
[...] They are, in fact, ""suicide brigades"", thrown into the ""meat grinder"" in the Azov area which will cause the failure of the Ukrainian Wehrmacht led by Zalujnyi"".
NARRATIVE: The US will send 200,000 Ukrainian suicide bombers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, into the offensive.
Reality: The Armed Forces of Ukraine are subordinate to Kiev, and the counteroffensive will be launched when they are sufficiently equipped to increase their chances and have as few losses as possible.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In this article, massively distributed by the Russian press, the Ukrainian army is called the Wehrmacht, which was the official name of the armed forces of Nazi Germany between 1935 and 1945. It is a new attempt by Russian propaganda to show that Ukraine it is closely related to the Nazi ideology, even regarding the military organization.
According to this false narrative, the Pentagon is preparing an offensive against Russia, using the mobilized Ukrainian military, who will become cannon fodder when they are sent to the ""meat grinder in the Azov area"". The Ukrainian army would be directly subordinated to the US, which they will send the military to certain death against their will. The Russian press quotes various independent and Western sources or those close to President Zelenski, without showing exactly what they said or where the so-called statements were recorded.
In reality, in February Ukraine announced the formation of several additional brigades of the National Guard, the National Police and the State Border Service within the national project ""Offensive Guard"". The backbone of the new brigades consists of officers and soldiers who have extensive experience of fighting in different areas of the front in the east of the country or another military experience. According to the Ministry of Defense in Kiev, the new brigades are composed of ""motivated patriots"", being called elite reserve troops. The respective soldiers were invited to join the army to participate in the future offensive operations, and the defense actions involve men without experience, but who have passed the necessary military training.
At the same time, on the territory of Ukraine all the armed forces are subordinated to the Major General Statute. According to Ukrainian legislation, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is appointed by the President and voted by the Parliament, periodically reporting to the legislature. Neither the US, nor any other country, can have troops on the territory of Ukraine without the consent of the Parliament in Kiev, and the coordination of the Ukrainian army by foreign forces is not allowed by the legislation.
The Ukrainian spring counter-offensive, planned in Kiev at the end of last year, was postponed due to the prolongation of the fighting for Bahmut, but also the delayed supply of some types of weaponry by the West, according to Ukrainian military analysts.
It is true that Ukrainian soldiers are trained in the West, but this training has the role, on the one hand, of familiarizing them with the Western equipment delivered to Ukraine and, on the other hand, with operational standards and modern combat. The purpose of this training and equipping with modern weapons is precisely to reduce losses as much as possible in case of a counter-offensive. Russia, on the other hand, is the one that did not take into account the human and material costs of its campaign. Throughout the entire war, the lack of training of the Russian soldiers and commanders could be observed and it was seen that they operate according to outdated procedures, specific to the 20th century. On the eastern front, in Bahmut, Soledar and other localities, the Russians attacked in human waves, probably the most expensive offensive method. All these factors led to significant losses among the Russian army. On the other hand, Ukraine, disadvantaged in terms of human resources and equipment, waged a war from the very beginning in which it tried to inflict the greatest possible losses on the opponent while minimizing, at the same time, its own losses.
The way in which this news is presented demonstrates the desire of Russian propaganda to discourage the involvement and resistance of Ukrainians in the face of Russian aggression, to distance the population from the political leaders. NATO countries are not participating in the war in Ukraine. Asked by journalists before the meeting of defense ministers from the member states in February if NATO is at war with Russia, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that ""neither NATO nor the allies are part of the conflict"". He repeatedly emphasized that the Alliance it is not part of the conflict, but only helps Kiev, which has the right to defend itself against Moscow's aggression, according to the UN Charter.
After more than 13 months of large-scale war, Russian propaganda shifts the emphasis to the narrative about NATO and/or the USA that want to destroy Russia at any cost, consolidating the image of the external enemy in order to minimize discussions about the failures of the ""special military operation"". at the same time, Russia is doing everything possible to minimize Ukraine's effort to mobilize new human resources, necessary to resist the armed aggression.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aimed to distort the truth about the war in Ukraine. According to the Russian media, the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the EU has sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022. The pro-Kremlin media also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are freed from Russia. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion starting from November 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

In reality, the respective site is a private project that tries to draw attention to people who support, in one way or another, the interests of Russia, regardless of the country they come from.
Propaganda: Ukraine will organize more and more assassinations, and the list of future victims is public
NEWS: ""The Ukrainian site Mirotvoret is a plan to kill people by the regime in Kiev, the official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zakharova, said during a program on Radio Sputnik, commenting on the killing in St. Petersburg of war correspondent Vladlen Tatarski.
The diplomat drew attention to the fact that Tatarski was included in the database of the Mirotvoret website, being periodically threatened with death.
""The Mirotvoret site is not one or two years old. All these public figures from the West and here, who have just arrived, did not listen to our explanation in the past about what the respective site is, and now they have no excuse and cannot say that they did not know. They simply did not want to listen to our explanations. The Mirotvoret site is that very map, that very plan, that very program of extermination of people by the Kiev regime and its accomplices"", said Maria Zaharova"".
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian authorities will continue to assassinate people close to the Kremlin based on a list published on a website
Reality: The Ukrainian site Mirotvoret is not a ""blacklist"", but a database of people who threaten the security of Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova used the topic of the killing of pro-Kremlin blogger Vladlen Tatarski to once again blame Kiev for the attacks, saying that on the website Ukrainian website Mirotvoret publishes a ""black list"" of people who will be killed by the Ukrainian services. It claims that Vladlen Tatarski was on that website, that's why he was killed. It is not the first time that the Kremlin complains that Ukraine allows the publication of information about the people who collaborate with the Russian army or against whom there are certain suspicions.
In March, after the name of the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, accused of collaborating with Russia during the war in Ukraine, appeared on the website, the Russian Foreign Ministry mentioned that the website is a ""real list of people who should be shot, against whose nationalists took absolutely aggressive and monstrous measures"". At the same time, neither the OSCE, nor UNESCO, nor international journalism organizations paid attention to this Ukrainian website, the Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out.
In fact, Moscow does not like that the networks of lesser-known people, from various states, with which Russia collaborates, become visible and much more transparent following the publication of some information on this Ukrainian website. Russian propaganda claims that the people mentioned on this site will be assassinated. In reality, the site contains the names of dozens and hundreds of Ukrainians, along with Russians and other nationalities, suspected of facilitating Russian aggression. In January 2023, Oleksiy Arestovich, the former adviser to the president of Ukraine, was included in this list after a statement regarding a series of explosions in the city of Dnipro, which became a topic of anti-Ukrainian discussions on Russian television stations. Arestovici resigned, but lives in Kiev and even announced the launch of a new political project, without fearing that he will be assassinated by someone. The site itself positions itself as a ""center for studies of signs of crimes against Ukraine's national security, peace, stability, international law and order"". Being founded by a former advisor to the Ministry of the Interior, Anton Gherascenko, civic activist and expert, the Mirotvoret site has become an information exchange network between journalists, politicians and researchers, who analyze the Russian-Ukrainian hybrid war and the supporters of Russia's false narratives.
For example, after Senator Diana Iovanovici-Sosoaca submitted a bill to the Romanian Parliament for the annexation of Ukrainian territories, the Mirotvoret Center requested the legal authorities to examine this information as a ""declaration about the commission by this citizen"" of deliberate acts against the national security of Ukraine, peace, security of mankind and international law and order, as well as other crimes"".
Since since 2014 the site has published information about thousands of Russian collaborators, the killing of some of them was used by the Kremlin as a basis to accuse Kiev of Nazism and terrorism. The only problem that sparked great discussions in Ukraine regarding the operation of this site is the publication of personal data. According to Anton Gherascenko, the site has the right to publish any information about persons suspected of betraying Ukraine's national interests under art. 17 of the Constitution regarding the defense of the territorial sovereignty of the country. The site has no direct connection with the Ukrainian authorities and cannot be classified as a ""blacklist"".
Regarding the murder of the Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarski, the case is being investigated as a ""crime of great interest"", according to the Russian authorities. At the same time, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mihailo Podolyak attributed the explosion to an ""internal political struggle"" in Russia, writing on Twitter that ""spiders eat each other in a jar"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the actions of the Ukrainian authorities. According to Russian propaganda, Ukraine recruits volunteers for Nazi brigades, while the actions of the Russian military in the Kherson region are an example of human behavior. The Russian press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. Also, according to Russian propaganda, half of the soldiers of the Ukrainian army are foreigners, which means that NATO is participating in the war, and the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine.

In Germany we observe a real fascism. It is a special type of fascism, a ""green"" one that is closely related to Ukrainian Nazism.
NARRATIVE: Fascist Germany supports Ukraine to destroy Russia and forget the atrocities of the Second World War.
Reality: Germany is helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggressors who have committed numerous war crimes
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russian government media cites various experts from Moscow to prove that all accusations against Russia regarding war crimes committed by its military in Ukraine are false. According to Russian propaganda, an important role in this process is played by Germany, which would be led by a new type of fascists - ""greens"" -, has lost its sense of guilt for the crimes committed during the Second World War and wants them to be forgotten by condemning Russia in a new trial of the Nurnberg type.
This false narrative is a mixture of historical and current information. In reality, the Russian military committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, as shown by the traces found by the Ukrainian forces, including mass graves, in Bucea, Irpin, Borodeanka, Izium and other localities. Also, torture chambers were found in Bucea, Kherson and Nova Kahovka. At the same time, Russia killed numerous civilians in bombings of some residential areas, and this winter also carried out a campaign against the Ukrainian infrastructure by which millions of civilians were left in the cold and in the dark. All these actions contravene the international law regarding the conduct of wars, the EU and US leaders discussing the establishment of a special tribunal to judge the crimes committed by the Russians in Ukraine during the invasion launched by Vladimir Putin.
In mid-March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant in the name of Vladimir Putin, accusing him of committing war crimes in Ukraine. Prosecutor Karim Khan opened an investigation into the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine a year ago. In response, Russian politicians and the press from Moscow began to threaten the judges and tell the Russians that all the evidence is fabricated and the accusations - false.
Berlin became the target of Russian propaganda after the Minister of Justice, Marco Buschman, declared that he will have to implement the arrest warrant if Vladimir Putin visits Germany.
On the other hand, Berlin also supports Ukraine with ammunition and military equipment, including Leopard tanks, to help it resist the aggression of the Russian Federation. Berlin's actions are not directed against Russia and do not aim to destroy it, but according to international law, Ukraine has every right to defend itself and receive help to do so.
Having fewer and fewer logical arguments regarding the decisions taken by Berlin and the International Criminal Court, Russian propaganda brings to the surface for the internal public opinion various historical arguments about Germany's desire to take revenge on Russia for the defeat in the Second World War, emphasizing the links, ""fascist"" German leaders with ""Ukrainian Nazis"".
Nazism and fascism are banned both in Ukraine and in Germany, being a painful topic especially in the latter. As Veridica showed, back in 2015 Nazi and communist ideology was banned in Ukraine. The Russian press traditionally catalogs nationalist and identity manifestations from the ex-Soviet space as forms of Nazism/fascism, without noticing that neo-Nazism and extremism are widespread ideological currents in Russia, including in its army, becoming instruments of Kremlin control and manipulation over society through the mass media.
Even if it tries to justify Moscow's actions in Ukraine with historical arguments, the Russian press does not tell the whole truth and does not mention anything about the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, which makes the Soviet Union as guilty of starting the Second World War as Nazi Germany. During the signing of this pact, which also contained an additional secret protocol, the Moscow airport terminal and the buildings visited by German diplomats were decorated with the famous flags with the German swastika.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about Nazism in Ukraine and in the West. The Russian press also wrote that Zelenski has secret ties with the Nazis. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press demonstrates that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians would not They support the Nazi leaders in Kiev According to the Russian government media, because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are being liberated by Russia.

They quote a false narrative published by a far-left German newspaper that has close ties to the Russian press.
Propaganda: The German press discovered Zelensky's true connections with the Nazi leaders in Ukraine
NEWS: ""One of the goals of the special operation in Ukraine is denazification. However, Kiev's Western allies and sponsors do not notice the Nazis in Ukraine [...]
The German publication ""Junge Welt"" recently published an investigation about the Nazi origins of the Ukrainian leadership, showing who is really the master of the country. [...] The German authors used in their investigation, among other things, materials from the publication Ukraina.ru.
Some Western politicians were embarrassed by Zelenski's appearance together with a neo-Nazi soldier from ""Azov"" (an organization declared terrorist and banned in Russia) during a video address to the Greek parliament [...].
In March 2022, the group ""Pravii sektor"" (Right Sector), led by Dmytro Iaros, which had previously been an illegal armed formation, was integrated into the Ukrainian army or represented the nucleus of the 67th separate mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In this how the neo-Nazi military gained access to modern western weapons.
The President of Ukraine and the Verkhovna Rada are now spokesmen and assistants of neo-Nazi structures such as ""Azov"". [...] Without these neo-Nazi structures, as the German authors write, Ukraine's ""proxy war machine"" directed against Russia it will stop. [...]
The Nazis were legalized (with the approval of the NATO and EU leadership) by including their formations in the National Guard, the Security Service of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine.""
NARRATIVE: An investigation by the German media proves that Zelenski has connections with the Nazis.
Reality: Nazi ideology and symbols are banned in Ukraine, and the German media investigation is a retelling of Russian propaganda narratives
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the German press that allegedly discovered Volodymyr Zelensky's lesser-known ties to Ukrainian neo-Nazis ""informally supported by the West"" is, in fact, a lesser-known newspaper that collaborated with the government press Russian in recent years. The ""Junge Welt"" newspaper, of Marxist orientation, is considered in Germany to be of the extreme left, continuing the German communist traditions.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ""Junge Welt"" published a series of articles that copied the false narratives of Russian propaganda. Most of the time, the German newspaper is cited by the Moscow press to illustrate or present its own false narratives. as an independent point of view. At the end of November 2022, Ukraina.ru, quoting ""Junge Welt"", wrote without providing any concrete evidence that Ukrainian refugees beat the residents of Berlin who speak Russian, and in December - that Zelenski wants to make money during the war and does not care about the suffering of civilians.
The investigation cited by the Russian press is based 90 percent on various propaganda narratives from the past. ""Junge Welt"" quotes articles from Ukraina.ru in this investigation, and the Russian news portal writes about the ""great discovery"" in Germany regarding the Nazi origins of Ukrainian leaders.
In fact, the text published by ""Junge Welt"" and Ukraina.ru does not resemble an investigation. Zelenski is accused of being around some leaders of the ""Azov"" military group, which means he is a Nazi; that he included former nationalist fighters in the regular Ukrainian army; that it is led by the Nazis with the tacit consent of the West, which pretends not to notice these ""followers of Hitlerism"". It is, in fact, an opinion article, and not an investigation because it does not present any evidence that prove that Zelenski is a Nazi or that he is a ""puppet of neo-Nazis"".
Moreover, the Russian press does not mention anything about the prohibition of Nazi and communist ideology in Ukraine in 2015, which provides for criminal liability for the promotion of neo-Nazism. The appearance of Zelensky in a video message with a soldier from the ""Azov"" group or the inclusion of this regiment in the regular Ukrainian army does not mean the legalization of Nazism, on the contrary, it is an attempt to bring all armed groups under the control of the government.
According to the Israeli analyst, originally from Russia, Viacheslav Lihaciov, specialist in extremist movements, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and the study of the Holocaust, there is no scientific basis for calling the ""Azov"" group Nazi or neo-Nazi. The expert considers that Ukraine's decision to take under control all groups of combatants and to subordinate them to the National Guard. Also, ""Azov"" bravely defended the inhabitants of the city of Mariupol, bombed and destroyed by the Russian army in the spring of last year. The specialist analyzed for four years the contacts between the representatives of the ""Azov"" group with the Jewish and Muslim communities in Mariupol, noting that no problem was identified. The ""Azov"" regiment signed up for the launch of the large-scale invasion of Russia against Ukraine, representatives of several ethnic groups, including Russophones from the east of the country.
Being a structure subordinate to the Ukrainian army, the interaction of Ukrainian political leaders with ""Azov"" is not proof of their neo-Nazi attitudes. The Russian press frequently categorizes nationalist (or even identity) manifestations in the ex-Soviet space as forms of Nazism/fascism. In reality, according to international experts, neo-Nazism and extremism are very important ideological currents in Russia, and especially in the Russian army, becoming instruments of control and manipulation of the Kremlin over society through the mass media.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding neo-Nazism in Ukraine and in the West. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press wrote that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about Moscow's restraint when bombing Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians they do not support the Nazi leaders in Kiev According to the Russian government media, because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are being liberated by Russia.

In reality, the weapons purchased under the ""Gift for Putin"" project are intended to strengthen the Ukrainian defense against Russian aggression.
Propaganda: Czech volunteers give Ukraine a rocket launcher to kill civilians in Donbass
NEWS: ""Volunteers from the Czech Republic collected 1.2 million euros for the purchase of the RM-70 Vampire missile launcher, offered to the Ukrainian army. With this system, the Armed Forces of Ukraine bomb the residential areas of the districts of Donetsk"", according to DNR NEWS, which presents the help offered by the Czechs to Kiev as a gesture directed against Russian-speakers in Donbass.
""Donetsk was bombed with the Czechoslovak RM-70 Vampire system. Fragments of the respective ammunition were found. At least five houses were damaged in Kievski district of Donetsk as a result of the morning bombings. [...] It is a multiple launch missile system manufactured during Czechoslovakia"", writes the Russian newspaper ""Komsomolskaia Pravda"", emphasizing that the military equipment was offered to Ukraine for it to destroy.
NARRATIVE: The Czechs offered Ukraine a missile launcher so that it could bomb civilians in Donbass.
Reality: Within the ""Gift for Putin"" initiative, Czech citizens raised money to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Reacting to the numerous requests of the Ukrainian authorities to the West, the Czech businessman Dalibor Dedek launched the ""Gift for Putin"" project in May of last year with the aim of supporting Ukraine. The money collected goes to the account of the Ukrainian embassy at Prague and, under the auspices of the Czech Ministry of Defence, are used to purchase military equipment from Czech manufacturers and suppliers in accordance with the requirements of the Ukrainian military.In the past, the Czechs have bought the Tomas tank or the Viktor air defense system for the Ukrainian military.
They are purchases of small proportions, but which represent a symbolic gesture of support for Ukraine's defense efforts against the military aggression of the Russian Federation. The collection of funds is carried out with the aim of demonstrating the solidarity of the Czech society towards the sufferings of the Ukrainian people; in the first 4 hours of the collection, the Czechs collected 85 thousand euros for a rocket launcher.
In order to discredit this initiative and block similar ones in different countries of the world, the press from Moscow, but also from the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, distributed a false narrative, according to which the Czech volunteers provide Ukraine with a rocket launcher to contribute to the killing of civilians in Donbass.
On the day when the organizers of the ""Gift for Putin"" project announced the purchase of the missile launcher, the Donetsk press wrote about the bombing of residential areas in Donbass from a similar launcher, which Ukraine received from the Czech Republic last year, and most of the articles the press presented the Czech donors as accomplices of the crimes committed against Russian speakers.
In reality, according to the Czech media, the project is a symbol of condemnation of Russian aggression and support for the legitimate defensive efforts of the Ukrainian people who are waging a war of liberation. Each time, the superiority of Russia in terms of equipment and ammunition compared to Ukraine is mentioned in the Czech press.
The narrative aims to manipulate public opinion, showing that the war in Ukraine is launched and fueled by the West, being directed primarily against Russian speakers in Donbass.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives. According to Russian propaganda, the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. Russian government media also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine, but it is forced to do it to defend itself. Starting from November 2021, the Russian press wrote that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself from a NATO aggression, being forced to save Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West .

It is a great pity that the war will continue under the guise of a struggle for peace, which the West is leading through military actions.
NARRATIVE: Russia and China want peace in Ukraine, while the West fuels the war
Reality: Russia invaded Ukraine, being supported during the war by China
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, the Russian government media wrote about the peace plan discussed by the two leaders. The Russian press accused the West of rejecting a peace plan and of wanting the continuation of hostilities at any cost.
The portal also writes that the war in Ukraine is the fault of the West, which provides Kiev with weapons and encourages it to liberate its territories. If Russia is defeated by the West in this war, the ""next victim"" will be China, which will go through a ""democratic execution"". Praising China's peace plan, rejected by Ukraine and the West, the Russian press writes that NATO states are offering tanks and missiles to Kiev, thus continuing the war. Based on these statements, a series of Telegram channels close to the Kremlin distributed false narratives about peacemakers (China, Russia) and aggressors (NATO, USA, the West) in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press calls the initiatives of Xi Jinping and Putin as ideas of lasting peace, based on respect for international law.
In reality, according to the rules of international law, especially the UN Charter, every state has an inherent right to defend itself. The Russian army invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and this act of armed aggression was condemned by most of the world's states and the most important international organizations.
The West is not part of the conflict, but only helps Kiev to defend itself. It was not the West that caused the war by supplying Ukraine with weapons, but Moscow, which invaded a sovereign and independent state. The ""special military operation"" initially aimed to change the political leadership of Ukraine and subordinate Kiev to the political interests of Moscow. Russian propaganda makes a classic narrative loop: the cause is replaced with the consequence. The cause - the invasion of Ukraine by Russia - is presented in a deliberately false way as a consequence of the arms deliveries.
Russian aggression has been condemned by most of the world's states several times. 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. A series of international mechanisms have been launched to designate Russia as a state that finances terrorism. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of being responsible for war crimes committed in Ukraine.
President Zelensky cautiously welcomed China's peace plan to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but said it would only be acceptable if it led to the withdrawal of troops from all Ukrainian territory occupied by Vladimir Putin. Mihailo Podoliak, adviser to the Ukrainian president, rejected China's ""unrealistic"" proposal to end the conflict, writing on Twitter that Beijing should not ""bet on an aggressor who broke the law and will lose the war"". According to the international press, China has supported Russia since the first days of the war. Beijing provided technology that Moscow's military needed to continue fighting in Ukraine despite international sanctions and export controls, according to an analysis of Russian customs data. While the West supported Ukraine's defensive efforts, China helped an aggressor state.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that had the same political goal. According to Russian propaganda, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine, knowing that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. In order to convince public opinion of the necessity of mobilization in Russia, the Russian press wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and a possible NATO aggression.

Politnavigator.net erroneously and selectively used survey data to present the population of the Republic of Moldova as increasingly favorable the cause of Russia in the war in Ukraine. In fact, the number of those who give justice to Russia in this war is almost twice less than those who consider that justice is on the side of Ukraine.
NEWS: ""More than half of the inhabitants of the Republic of Moldova (55.9%) are against the country's accession to NATO. For membership, only 29.6%, according to a survey conducted by the CBS-Research company, commissioned by Watchdog.MD.
In addition, 52.3% of Moldovans believe that Russians and Ukrainians are the same people, 51.6% - that Russia is actually fighting in Ukraine with NATO, 44.7% do not believe that Russia is preparing the destabilization of Moldova, 47.7% - he does not consider that Russia threatens the security of Moldova.
67.2% believe that the president of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, should go to Russia for negotiations for (a better price for) gas.
The share of Moldovans who consider that the Russian intervention was not motivated is decreasing. Already 26% are convinced that Russia is defending Donbas from Ukrainian attacks (in January they were 22.5%). The number of those who believe that Ukraine is liberated from Nazism also increased - from 12% to 13.3%. Fewer and fewer citizens blame Vladimir Putin personally - in one year this indicator dropped from 34.2% to 21%. Instead, they increasingly blame the US and NATO."" NARRATIVE: More and more Moldovan citizens agree with Russia in the war against Ukraine.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Ever since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on February 24, 2022, the Republic of Moldova was considered the most vulnerable country in the region and the next target in case the Ukrainian army surrendered. Its armed forces are practically non-existent, in addition, it is facing a secessionist conflict in the East, in the Transnistrian region, controlled by a Moscow-client regime and where a Russian military contingent and a Soviet-era military depot are stationed.
Warnings about a plan by Moscow to destabilize the internal situation in the Republic of Moldova, led by a pro-European government, intensified after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared in Brussels that his country's secret services have information in this regard.
Shortly after, the presidency in Chisinau and the Information and Security Service confirmed that they were aware of such a plan. The White House described as ""deeply worrying"" the information about Russia's plan to destabilize the political situation in the Republic of Moldova. Recently, Washington accused Russia of trying to destabilize the situation in the Republic of Moldova. On March 14, the European Parliament also debated the situation in the Republic of Moldova and the challenges that the Chisinau authorities have to manage during this period.
The authorities in Chisinau say that, at least at the current stage, the Republic of Moldova is not threatened militarily, but is the target of a hybrid war on the part of Russia. The Republic of Moldova is extremely vulnerable to Russian propaganda, according to several national and international studies and reports, and the most affected categories of citizens are the Russian-speaking minorities, which represent approximately 20% of the population, the elderly and the pious parishioners of Orthodox Church, subordinate to the Russian Patriarchate.
On March 9, the WatchDog organization presented a new opinion poll, which also includes a series of questions aimed at the impact of disinformation and propaganda on public opinion in the Republic of Moldova. The survey results were misinterpreted and presented selectively by politnavigator.
OBJECTIVE: To present the population of the Republic of Moldova as increasingly favorable to the Russian Federation and, respectively, against the European course drawn by the authorities. To convince the Russian public that the country should come out of international isolation and its cause (the war in Ukraine) is getting more and more support and understanding in other countries of the world.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian publication uses survey data in a manipulative and selective way. Some of the figures presented in the article are incorrect, others are compared with those from a previous survey, but there are hidden results that denote a different attitude of the population of the Republic of Moldova than the one the authors of the article are trying to promote.
The statement that ""only"" 29.6% of the population of the Republic of Moldova would opt for joining NATO, and approximately 56% would be against, is correct. Only that the authors, who will later compare certain results with those of a similar study carried out in in January, I won't do it this time either. Probably because in January, ""only"" 26.9% would have voted for joining NATO.
The survey also shows that 63.3% of the respondents believe that Maia Sandu should go to Moscow to negotiate the gas price. Not 67.2%, as stated by Politnavigator.
At the same time, according to a similar survey organized by Watchdog in May 2022, 25% of respondents considered Putin personally guilty for provoking the war in Ukraine, compared to 21% currently. Instead, the number of those who blame Russia increased from 14.7% to 19.5%. The number of those who blame the USA and NATO remained at the same level, refuting the data presented by politnavigator.
The authors of the article do not refer to the fact that Vladimir Putin's rating in the list of trust of Moldovan citizens dropped from 38% in January to 33.8% in March, and he fell from first place to fifth in the list of trust in international personalities. It also ignores the fact that 78.4% of the respondents would not agree that their country should support Russia in exchange for a lower gas price, even if the majority of citizens were affected by the increase in tariffs. 37.7% of respondents agree with Ukraine in this war and almost twice as many - 18.3% - with Russia. The survey also shows that more than half of Moldovans would vote for joining the EU, while for the Eurasian Union - slightly more than 20 percent. Russia came almost to the bottom of the list of trust from a list of international organizations and states - with 47%, compared to 76% Germany, 74% Romania, 71.5%. France.
""The survey includes multiple questions aimed at the impact of disinformation and propaganda on public opinion in the Republic of Moldova. In particular, there is still a very high impact of the Kremlin's propaganda on topics related to security, Russian aggression in Ukraine, international relations and energy topics. Compared to the previous similar survey, small improvements can be noted on several topics targeted by disinformation campaigns. Thus we can note that, for example, the number of those who said that the Republic of Moldova should support Russian aggression against Ukraine in exchange for cheaper gas decreased from 14% to 11%. At the same time, despite the intense discussions of the last month, the number of those who consider that the Russian Federation represents a threat to our country increased by only 1% (from 41% to 42%)"", note the authors of the study.
NUTS OF TRUTH: A fairly large number of Moldovan citizens agree with Russia in the war in Ukraine, but an exact number of them would be difficult to estimate, including because the results of the elections in the Republic of Moldova showed that the pre-election polls have a large margin of error, which reduces their credibility.

In reality, the creation of this protection zone can only take place through demilitarization, that is, through the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the plant, the option excluded by Moscow.
Propaganda: Ukraine does not want to collaborate with the IAEA for the creation of a protection zone in Zaporozhye
NEWS: ""Kiev is, for now, not ready to implement the IAEA initiative regarding the creation of a protection zone around the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, which will exclude the opening of fire from the territory of the plant and against it, declared the permanent representative of Russia next to the international bodies from Vienna, Mihail Ulianov [...].
""Ukraine, unfortunately, is not ready to take this step,"" he wrote on Telegram on Saturday. The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is located on the left bank of the Dnieper, near the city of Energodar. It is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe by the number of reactors and capacity. There are six reactors with a capacity of 1 gigawatt each. From March 2022, the plant is under the protection of the Russian military. The Russian Foreign Ministry emphasized that this step is necessary to avoid the leakage of nuclear and radioactive materials.
The Ukrainian army continues to regularly bomb Energodar and the territory of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. The Russian Minister of Defense, Sergey Soigu, said that the regime in Kiev is trying to make possible the occurrence of a nuclear catastrophe, continuing to intentionally bomb the plant"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine blocks the initiative to create a protection zone at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant.
Reality: Russia opposes the IAEA's proposal to demilitarize the plant, increasing the risk of a nuclear catastrophe
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the creation of a protection zone at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant depends not only on Ukraine, but especially on Russia. The Russian press quotes the permanent representative of Moscow to the international bodies in Vienna, Mihail Ulianov, who manipulates public opinion by telling only half the truth regarding the creation of a safety zone at Energodar. According to the IAEA experts, both sides must cease fire in the plant area, this being the step before demilitarization.
Moscow says it has every right to ""protect"" the center militarily - located on the territory of Ukraine and occupied by force, including the use of tanks, at the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Ukraine - and vehemently opposes the idea of ​​withdrawing the military, ammunition, weapons and equipment that it has placed on the territory of the nuclear object. In August 2022, the Kremlin opposed the demilitarization of the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant and asked the West to put pressure on Ukraine to reduce tensions in its area. The IAEA proposal, which provides for the demilitarization of the plant is rejected by Russia especially after Russia illegally annexed the Zaporizhia region of Ukraine, which it partially occupied, in September 2022. Despite the warnings of the international community, President Vladimir Putin ordered the inclusion of the plant in the Russian electricity grid and in the register of federal nuclear facilities.
According to Russia's false narratives, which contradict the norms of international law, the plant is the property of the Russian state, and the military, tanks and missiles are kept there to defend the area from the bombings and provocations organized by the Ukrainian army. Based on this truncated logic, the creation of a protection zone depends only on Ukraine, because Russia manages its nuclear objectives as it sees fit.
Russia ignores the request of 42 states of the world to withdraw the army from the territory of the power station in order to create a protection zone. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly requested that the Russian forces leave the perimeter of the nuclear power plant in Zaporozhye. The UN also launched a call for the demilitarization of the central area. All this information proves that it is not Ukraine that is blocking the initiative to create a protection zone at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, but Russia, which has invaded a sovereign state and is endangering global nuclear security. Russia's actions are called by experts nuclear terrorism, applied in the context of a war of invasion.
The plant was exposed to the risk of a nuclear accident even by the Russian army repeatedly - it opened fire directly against it, launched shots from its territory and by bombing the Ukrainian energy network it was disconnected from it. The most recent such attack, which led to the disconnection, took place on March 9, when the plant was disconnected for the sixth time since the beginning of the war from the Ukrainian electricity grid after a Russian missile attack. The Ukrainian nuclear operator Energoatom warned again about the risk of a serious accident following the Russian bombings, given that electricity is needed to keep the reactor cooling mechanisms running, and existing generators are useful as back-up solutions. breakdown for exceptional situations.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the situation in the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant area. The Russian press wrote that the IAEA mission praised the Russian army for defending the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant from Ukrainian bombings. According to Russian propaganda, at the behest of the US, Kiev will cause a nuclear disaster in Zaporozhye, or an explosion will be ""organized"" to hide the traces of American biological weapons laboratories.

In the territories controlled by the group of drug addicts and Nazis from the post-Ukrainian space, the collaborators of the nuclear power plants will be mobilized.
The deputies of the Supreme Rada addressed the National Agency ""Energoatom"" to obtain the list of specialists who can be enlisted in the army. The Zelensky regime is governed by a simple formula - war to the last Ukrainian.""
NARRATIVE: Nuclear power plant specialists from Ukraine will be sent to the front.
Reality: Ukrainian legislation prohibits the mobilization of specialists from critical enterprises
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the enlistment in the army of specialists who are employed at enterprises of critical and strategic importance for the Ukrainian state is prohibited by law. The employees of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine cannot be enlisted in the army, according to the mobilization law, because the National Agency ""Energoatom"", which coordinates these state enterprises, is of critical importance. During the period of martial law, the state considers the specialists in this field the same as important as the fighters in the front area.
The news published on a series of news websites and promoted on social interaction networks is based on a document signed by two Ukrainian parliamentarians, which asks the nuclear power plants to provide them with lists of people who will be enlisted in the army. This document is fake, taking into account the grammatical and stylistic mistakes in the text, as well as a series of names of companies and officials written similar to the traditional formulas in the Russian language, but foreign to the Ukrainian language. The document is addressed to the ""Energoatom"" company, being the letter ""E"" from the Russian language, and not the one from the Ukrainian language. Also, the names of the parliamentarians who would have sent the respective request to the nuclear power plants are written in Russian style.
There are also a number of procedural elements that demonstrate that ""the request of the Ukrainian parliamentarians is a false one. According to the law of preparation for mobilization and mobilization, the process of organizing enlistment in the army is the responsibility of the Government through the Ministry of Defense, and not that of the Parliament. The request deputies would not have passed the legal department's opinion, provided by the Supreme Rada Regulation, if it was formulated in this way. Parliamentarians can only control and monitor the mobilization process, but they do not have the right to be involved in the launch of mechanisms that belong to the competences of other structures Of the state.
The purpose of this false narrative is to demonstrate to the public opinion in Russia and the former Soviet states that the crisis of human resources in the Ukrainian army is becoming more and more acute, Kiev being forced to mobilize nuclear energy specialists.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the mobilization carried out in Ukraine in the context of the war with Russia. The Russian press wrote that ordinary Ukrainians have no reason to fight against Russia, while the mothers and wives of Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle protest the war. According to Russian propaganda, Volodymyr Zelensky killed more than 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army, and the losses of the Ukrainian army are so high that students are forced to donate blood for the military.

Propaganda: Zelensky asks NATO to become part of the armed conflict in Ukraine
NEWS: ""The leader of the Kiev regime, Volodymyr Zelensky, commented during a discussion with journalists on the participation of the US and NATO in the Ukrainian conflict and proposed to the West to send their children to the area of ​​military actions.
""The USA must send its sons and daughters just like we do. They will have to fight. And they will pay with their lives,"" declared the leader of Ukraine in a very harsh style.
TV presenter Olga Skabeeva is convinced that in this way Zelenski provokes a large-scale war between the West and Russia. ""Zelenski asked NATO to enter the conflict,"" she wrote on her Telegram channel.
NARRATIVE: Zelenski asked NATO member states to send troops to Ukraine
Reality: Zelenski expressed his concern that after Ukraine, Russia will attack a NATO member state
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Volodymyr Zelensky's words were taken out of context and presented in a convenient way to the Russian government media to justify the need for the ""special military operation"", as the full-scale invasion is called in Moscow of Ukraine by Russia.
The President of Ukraine did not ask the NATO member states or the USA to ""send their sons and daughters"" to the war. The Russian press and some pages of social interaction networks distribute only the final part of a statement by Zelensky, eliminating the presentation of the context of to the leader from Kiev.
In a press conference organized one year after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Zelensky declared that a capitulation of Ukraine would move the war to the territory of NATO states. ""Russia will attack the NATO states, it will attack the Baltic states. So it will be. Then the US will send its sons and daughters, just like we are doing now. They will fight there because it is NATO"". Zelenski did not talk about sending troops to the territory of Ukraine or about the duty of the US to support Kiev with human resources, but emphasized the role of the NATO collective security system to which Ukraine aspired.
At the same press conference, Zelenski mentioned that the West's support of Ukraine during the war through arms deliveries represents a guarantee for the EU and NATO that there will be no expansion of the armed conflict on their territory. The leader from Kiev argued that a state's refusal to help Ukraine will cause the war to expand and other states to send their sons to the front to defend themselves against invasion.
To give more veracity to this fake news, the journalist Olga Skabeeva, called Putin's ""iron puppet"", is quoted, who commented on Telegram that ""Zelenski asked NATO to enter the conflict"".
Veridica dismantled a series of propaganda messages promoted by the Russian government media regarding the involvement of the West in the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, the Kremlin must mobilize to defeat NATO in the new ""war for the defense of the homeland"". At the same time, the West would force Russia to expand its military operations, after the EU sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022.

It all started from the students' viewing National College ""Scoala Centrala"" from Bucharest, as part of an extracurricular activity developed in partnership with the French Institute, of a film that debates the friendship between two teenagers faced with age-specific challenges.
On the route Europe - Gayropa, via Moscow
NEWS: ""The Alliance of Parents from Romania became aware of the fact that, on the 13th and 15th of February 2023, the students of the 7th and 8th grades were taken to watch the movie Close, as an educational activity, carried out in partnership with the French Institute. The film explicitly promotes the LGBT way of life, and the explanations given by the educational unit in response to the parents' reaction represent an embarrassing attempt to justify the training of children in an activity whose educational messages can be summarized as follows:
1-,,if a person of the same sex makes advances to you, i.e. shows ""romantic interest"" towards you, you must respond to those advances, because otherwise that person will commit suicide, and you will feel guilty""
2-,,suicide is a means of solving problems.""
NARRATIVE: LGBT propaganda in Romanian schools has the intention of changing the natural sexual orientation of children.
CONTEXT: The morally decadent West, which deviated from Christian values, is one of the main narratives of the propaganda war waged by Moscow against the EU and NATO, intensified to the maximum with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Topics related to the LGBT community have been used for years in attempts to discredit the European cultural space. Thus, the EU is presented as ""Gayropa"", a space in antithesis to that of traditional, Christian, Orthodox values, which Russia would represent. Not infrequently, homosexuality and pedophilia are presented to be practically the same thing, for to convince the public that, by promoting equality in relation to sexual orientation, the aim is actually to legalize pedophilia. Thus, the idea of ​​an ""LGBT agenda"" that the EU would try to impose by force is induced. The messages are then taken over by local ""spokesmen"" and adapted to the specifics of each targeted country.
However, similar narratives are also promoted in the area of ​​the Western radical right; part of it, but not all, was also cultivated by Russia.
In Romania, the strongest voice of the narrative was the Family Coalition, an association of several NGOs, foundations and associations, many of which have as their object of activity the promotion of traditional Christian values ​​(Parents for Religion Hour Association) , Association of Catholic Families ,,Vladimir Ghika"", Association of Romanian Orthodox Christian Students, Medical-Christian Philanthropic Association ,,Christiana"", Christian Foundation Father Arsenie Boca, Foundation of Holy Martyrs Brancovini, Association ,,Romanian Orthodox Youth"", Association ,,Orthodox Places "" etc.). The resounding failure of the main initiative of this coalition, namely the amendment of article 48 of the Romanian Constitution, led most of these organizations to regroup under another name, Platforma Impreuna, and one of the message bearers of the new coalitions became Alianta Parintilor, an NGO founded in 2016, noted in recent years especially for protests during the pandemic and taking anti-vaccine and anti-abortion positions.
In the middle of last month, several students of the ""Scoala Centrala"" National College from Bucharest participated in the viewing of the film Close, winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2022, an event that gave rise to a riot in the part of the parents of some of the students. The reason is represented by the fact that the theme and message of the film by the Belgian director Lukas Dhont are considered by them to be, in fact, a more or less disguised propaganda for the ""LGBT way of life"". Following this gesture, the Parents' Alliance addressed an open letter to the school management, through which, dissatisfied with the response received to an initial petition, it requested more documents to be used ""in our future criminal proceedings (Art. 197 Penal Code: Relele treatments applied to the minor), considering that by watching this film that promotes juvenile homosexuality and incites suicide, our children were subjected to psychological aggression and suffered trauma."" At the same time, representatives of the association and parents also organized a protest in college girl.
OBJECTIVE: Increasing homophobic feelings, generating anti-system social movements, promoting the introduction of ultra-religious and ultra-conservative propaganda into the educational system.
Friendship between boys and homosexual propaganda
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The film ""Close"" is nowhere near one that explicitly promotes an LGBT lifestyle and, categorically, it does not elevate suicide to the rank of a solution for solving problems. Although we are talking about an artistic act, where the interpretation of his message is extremely subjective, we cannot ignore the opinions of specialists in the field: Thomas Rogers, well-known film and literature journalist, contributor to several publications, such as the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, Rolling Stone, Bloomberg Businessweek , New York Magazine s.a., considers ""Close"" to be rather ""a slow-burning drama about two 13-year-old boys, named Leo and Remi, whose close bond causes a revisionist reaction from one of them, then when classmates suspect that they are a couple. After Leo, upset, begins to distance himself from Remi, a series of disappointments turns into tragedy."" Jake Coyle, renowned screenwriter and film critic, says of ""Close"" that it is a film that talks about ""a friendship between two 13-year-old boys, Leo (Eden Dambrine) and Remi (Gustav De Waele), whose intimate relationship is put to the test, tragically, when Leo, trying to fit in with the other, more masculine boys, push Remi away."" Acclaimed film critic Peter Bradshaw sees the film as ""a heartbreaking tale of childhood friendship turned embarrassing.""
Obviously, the author of these lines also has his own interpretation of the film, but it is important to discuss facts now, and not ideas or feelings. But we can't do this without telling the story of the film, so we do the proper SPOILER ALERT here.
Thus, the only allusions to the sexual orientation of the two main characters are the ones that actually trigger the break between them and set the film in motion. They are spoken in an interrogative form, and although Remi's silence and the looks he gives Leo, when he vehemently denies, can be interpreted as an affirmative answer, this is absolutely not an example of explicit promotion. The reasons for Remi's suicide remain unexplained throughout the film, although Leo and the viewer suspect them. Regardless of this, his tragic disappearance does not solve any problem and is certainly not presented as a viable solution. Leo, although tormented by remorse, continues his life with other friends and family, and even finds the courage to confess his thoughts to Remi's mother, who, not surprisingly, hugs him and offers him support. Moreover, at the end of the film we discover that even Remi's parents continue their lives, that's right, starting over in another place, still missing their lost child. In fact, the film rather talks about bullying and its extreme consequences, because the homophobic jokes and remarks of the students in the film cause the break between the two friends. Then, as the director of the film himself states, ""Close"" talks about responsibility and the inability to take too big decisions at an age of still searching, in which the desire to be accepted in the community far surpasses other adolescent experiences.
I spoke by phone with teacher Olimpia Popa, Director of the Education - Health Department within the Parents' Alliance, in order to better understand how the members of the association reached the conclusions stated in the letter addressed to the Central School. Unfortunately, a few minutes after the start of the dialogue, the teacher refused to continue it, on the grounds that ""we are not even remotely part of the same family of spirits"". In addition, she requested that we not even quote the beginning of the dialogue, so that, honorable, as I promised, we will not do it. I also tried to talk to someone from the management of the Central School by phone, but no one answered the phone number displayed on the institution's website. I only had the communique officially given following the initial requests of the Parents' Alliance, in which it is specified that only students who expressed their intention to do so voluntarily participated in the event, as well as the fact that the film, as we explained above, has as its main themes some specific to teenagers, such as friendship, relationships between colleagues, bullying, etc.
In conclusion, although it is extremely likely that the character Remi in the film in question was homosexual, this is absolutely not specified explicitly in the film and in no case can it be considered propaganda. On this principle, any film with mobsters would mean pro-criminality propaganda. In the same way, neither Remi's suicide nor the pain his friend feels afterwards can be considered an invitation to suicide, just as no film about revenge can be classified as pro-killing propaganda.
We will note at the end only the misinformation with which the letter ends, proof that, as in many other cases, the arguments used in conservative actions are simple speculations, distortions of reality or subjective interpretations: ""the two tragic and sudden deaths of two transvestites (so from the ""LGBTQ+"" category) who committed suicide following crises and deceptions similar to those of the suicidal character in the movie Close"", from December 2022, in the city of Iasi, were actually caused, in one of the cases, from a pulmonary edema, and in the other, most likely, from carbon monoxide poisoning following an accidental fire.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: At the Cannes 2022 film festival, ""Close"" was nominated, among others, in the Queer Palm category, a category that awards films from the genre of Queer cinema, in which the subject is related to the LGBTQ community, which is why , very often, these films give rise to controversies.

Kremlin spokesman: NATO has become Russia's enemy because it is part of the conflict in Ukraine
NEWS: The spokesman of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov declared in an interview for Izvestia that the collective West, the USA and NATO are the main source of global Russophobia. ""We must not hide the truth or sweeten the reality, but call things as they are [...] NATO has become Russia's enemy because it is part of the conflict in Ukraine in which Ukrainians are killing civilians, including Ukrainians and Russians.
Peskov recalled the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who emphasized that the secret services of the NATO states are working non-stop against us, and their diverse and increasingly modern weapons from a technical point of view are offered free of charge to Ukraine [...]
At the meeting of the FSB college, Putin declared that the West has never shied away from using extremists against Russia in its own interests, having at its disposal all possible means [...]. The danger of terrorist actions on the territory of Russia is increasing due to the actions of Kiev and the West, which will continue to use their ""old friends"".
[...]
It is a rhetoric of the current war to defend the homeland and its future. Undoubtedly, the victory will be achieved by us. Russia was not defeated in any war for the defense of the homeland, despite the large number of enemies and traitors.
NARRATIVE: Russia must mobilize to defeat NATO in the new war for the defense of the homeland.
Reality: Russia is the one that attacked Ukraine, and NATO only helps Kiev to defend itself, without being part of the armed conflict
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, NATO is not participating in the war in Ukraine. Asked by journalists before the meeting of defense ministers from the member states in February if NATO is at war with Russia, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that ""neither NATO nor the allies are part of the conflict"". He repeatedly emphasized that the Alliance it is not part of the conflict, but only helps Kiev, which has the right to defend itself against Moscow's aggression, according to the UN Charter.
The West, regardless of whether we are talking about NATO or the EU, supports Ukraine with humanitarian aid, weapons and ammunition as a reaction to Russia's aggression. After a year of large-scale war, Russian propaganda shifts the emphasis to the narrative about NATO that wants to destroy Russia at all costs, consolidating the image of the external enemy to minimize discussions about the failures of the ""special military operation"". Russian propaganda, citing politicians pro- The Kremlin is again trying to make a narrative ring: the cause is replaced with the consequence. The cause - the invasion of Ukraine - is presented in a deliberately false way as a consequence of the arms deliveries, and these deliveries are called ""a NATO war against Russia"".
The West began sending defensive weapons to Ukraine in the run-up to the February 24, 2024, full-scale invasion, amid concerns expressed by foreign intelligence agencies that Moscow was preparing for war. The support given by the West to Ukraine since 2014 was linked to the war in Donbass, financed by the Kremlin, and the supply of lethal weapons in large quantities - to the large-scale unprovoked aggression of Russia in 2022.
On February 26, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, accused NATO of actively participating in the war in Ukraine and of working to dissolve his country. Putin stated that, by ""sending tens of billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine"", NATO is participating in the war. The Russian government press writes that NATO and Ukraine will finance various terrorist acts on Russian territory and will use the services of extremists, called by Putin ""old friends"" of the West. No evidence is provided that this occurs. In addition, NATO, known as a collective defense organization, has only entered a war once by activating Article 5, and that was in response to the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001. The threat of terrorism, however, remained , the main preoccupation of the North Atlantic Alliance for a long time, until the growing aggressiveness of Russia forced the Alliance to consolidate its positions on the eastern flank - but also to defend itself. Russia's accusations are totally unfounded and would be more in line with Russia's policies in the European space, as the case of a bank in Moscow that finances extremist movements in the EU through money laundering is known.
For the first time, Russia is discussing a new war for the defense of the homeland in order to encourage the mobilization of society and justify military actions on the territory of Ukraine. Russia is shown by the pro-Kremlin press as a victim of NATO aggression, and this conflict acquires symbolic values ​​by comparing the Soviet-German war - called in the ex-Soviet space the ""Great War for the Defense of the Fatherland"" - with the Russian-Western one. ""Russia was not defeated in any war for the defense of the homeland"", according to the Russian press. This message aims to strengthen trust in the authorities, deepening the image of Russia as a fortress besieged by ""evil forces"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aimed to distort the truth about the war in Ukraine. According to Russian media, the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the EU has sent troops to Ukraine before 2022 to weaken Russia. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are freed from Russia. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion starting from November 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

NARRATIVE: The pro-European government in Chisinau turns into a dictatorial regime which, at the instigation of the West, bans and undermines the Russian press.
The Republic of Moldova, under the assault of Russian disinformation and propaganda
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is the most vulnerable and exposed country in Central and Eastern Europe to Russian propaganda, according to the study ""Resistance to disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe"", carried out in 2018. It analyzed to what extent the 14 monitored states are vulnerable to Russian propaganda according to three indicators: the extent to which the population is exposed to disinformation and propaganda; countermeasures by the state; vulnerability to digital warfare.
The study finds that in the Republic of Moldova there are three large groups more likely to be manipulated by the mass media than the rest of the population. It is about ethnic minorities, speaking the Russian language, which represent almost 20% of the population; some active parishioners of the Orthodox Church of Moldova - which is canonically subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate and has among its ranks prelates who over time have spread false narratives identical to those coming from Russia - and the elders, who represent over 700,000 and whose level of average education is lower than the rest of the population.
""The Russian influence in the Republic of Moldova is very strong, because it is exercised in different ways, including through the numerous media institutions from the Russian Federation that are rebroadcast or republished in Moldova, through the new media and social networks, plus the sources of communication and influence of some political formations and other pro-Russian interest groups"", according to another regional study, carried out in 2017.
""Given Russia's strong informational presence, it managed to systematically manipulate public opinion and weaken social cohesion in the country. Traditionally, the Russian Federation promotes various manipulative narratives related to the Soviet past, implicitly the idea that the Republic of Moldova belongs to the so-called Russian world, Russkii mir. Starting with 2014 - in particular, when the Association Agreement with the EU was concluded -, Russia also promoted narratives directed against the European aspirations of the Republic of Moldova"", according to the Analysis and Strategy for increasing the resilience to disinformation in the Republic of Moldova, developed by one among the most famous think-tanks from Chisinau, the Institute for European Policies and Reforms.
And internal monitoring reports found that Russian TV stations rebroadcast in the Republic of Moldova were used as propaganda tools.
In 2018, the Parliament voted a law that prohibited the broadcast of certain categories of programs such as news, political debates and military broadcasts from states that have not ratified the European Convention on Transborder Television, among these states the Russian Federation. However, the provisions were canceled in 2020 by a parliamentary majority led by the Socialist Party, Filorus.
Parliament voted a similar law on June 2, in an attempt to reduce disinformation in the context of the war in Ukraine.
The Information and Security Service has blocked, since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, several websites that distributed fake news, information that incites hatred, war or violence. These are both online resources in Russian and Romanian.
""There is a need for a regulatory intervention and the institutionalization of a clear mechanism to counter disinformation in the online space. Also, there is a greater understanding of the need to emphasize the activity of countering disinformation when it affects the security of the state"", recommends the Institute for European Policies and Reforms in a public policy document, made in December 2022.
Recently, the Russian press, pro-Russian politicians from the Republic of Moldova, but also official Moscow criticized the Chisinau authorities for putting pressure on the Russian-language and Russian-language media
OBJECTIVE: To present the pro-European government in Chisinau as a dictatorship that carries out anti-Russian policies. To show that the West, by supporting and encouraging such a regime, does not actually believe in the freedoms it talks about, which it cites only to undermine Russia. To victimize the Russian press, indirectly justifying Russia's military actions and bellicose foreign policy as necessary to defend the so-called ""Russian space"" (russkii mir).
Reality: Chisinau wants to protect its informational space in conditions of hybrid war
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The establishment of censorship and the banning of the Russian media is a topic intensively promoted by Russian propaganda. In fact, the Chisinau authorities took several measures, after the Russian invasion in Ukraine, against propaganda and disinformation, which threatens the security of the Republic of Moldova. Moreover, officials from Chisinau publicly denounced, last fall, the fact that Russia is engaged in a hybrid war against the Republic of Moldova. Such a war also involves misinformation, fake news and propaganda.
The law prohibiting the broadcast of certain categories of broadcasts on TV refers to a certain category of states - those that have not ratified the European Convention on cross-border television. From a legal point of view, the measures taken based on this law were not strictly directed against the media in Russia, so they are not discriminatory.
A second category of measures targets the online space, where the Information and Security Service has identified pages that spread misinformation and blocked them. SIS also blocked websites in Romanian and Russian, as well as the Audiovisual Council warned and fined both Romanian and Russian language stations.
Finally, a third category of measures were taken based on the Audiovisual Code of the Republic of Moldova.
In December 2022, the Commission for Exceptional Situations decided to suspend the license of six television stations that promoted propaganda, but most of them were affiliated with fugitive politician Ilan Sor, involved in financing anti-government protests that were described as part of an effort to destabilize the Republic of Moldova, an objective also pursued by the Russian Federation; moreover, Moscow allegedly sent money and FSB officers to Moldova, who worked with the Sor Party in order to achieve this goal.
The decision was taken ""in order to protect the national information space and prevent the risk of disinformation by spreading false information or attempts to manipulate public opinion"" and was based on ""the multiple findings from the monitoring reports of the Audiovisual Council regarding violations of the Media Services Code Broadcasters of the Republic of Moldova, implicitly the application of sanctions for the lack of correct information in the coverage of national events, but also of the war in Ukraine"".
The establishment of the dictatorship in the Republic of Moldova is another narrative of the Russian propaganda that refers in the same terms to the entire Western world to suggest that there is an authentic democracy in Russia. However, international reports show that despite the fact that it is in a war zone and that during the past year it was in a state of emergency, the level of democracy in the Republic of Moldova has increased.
The Republic of Moldova ranked 69th out of 167 states in the democracy index for 2022, published at the beginning of February by the British research and analysis company Economist Intelligence Unit. The democracy index in the Republic of Moldova in 2022 was 6.23 points, slightly increasing compared to the previous year; also, the country obtained the highest number of points in the last seven years.
""As regards the political criteria, Moldova has a solid base that allows it to achieve the stability of the institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the respect and protection of minorities"", the European Commission states in its opinion on the application for accession of the Republic of Moldova to the EU, accepted in June 2022.
NUTS OF TRUTH: The Chisinau authorities have launched in recent years, but especially in 2022 in the context of the war in Ukraine, several actions aimed at combating disinformation and propaganda, especially from the Russian Federation, given that all the studies and reports it shows an increased vulnerability of the autochthonous informational space in front of these phenomena.

Demilitarization and denazification will be completed successfully. The Russian people, from Kaliningrad to Sakhalin, must understand that the special military operation is necessary for each of us"".
NARRATIVE: ""The special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: One year after the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, a series of propaganda narratives were published in the Russian government press justifying the ""special military operation"" by presenting it as an achievement of the Kremlin or as a step taken in time to prevent the destruction of Russia by NATO. The interview published by URA.RU summarizes the false narratives regarding the war in Ukraine promoted in Russia starting on February 24, 2022 and dismantled repeatedly by Veridica.
In reality, Russia's aggression against Ukraine was triggered when the latter opted for European integration. The model of liberal democracies and the rule of law is seen as a threat to the authoritarian regime of Vladimir Putin. If Ukraine were to become an EU member state, with the prosperity and stability brought by this status, the Russians would see that this model is also viable in the ex-Soviet states. Russia did not invade Ukraine to defend itself from NATO, and Nazism as a basic ideology in Ukrainian society is a propaganda invention. The West began sending defensive weapons to Ukraine in the run-up to the war and in the context of concerns expressed by secret services abroad that Moscow was preparing to invade. Armament deliveries on a larger scale took place only after the invasion of February 24, 2022, and even then it was mainly about individual and portable weapons.
There are no NATO bases on the territory of Ukraine, as the Russian media claims. They can appear only after the accession of Ukraine to the Alliance, according to the internal legislation and only with the consent of the Constitutional Court, there being a strict regulation by art. 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine. Also, all NATO military bases and training centers can be studied on the interactive map of the Alliance.
At the same time, Nazism and fascism in Ukraine are inventions of Russian politicians. In July 2015, Ukraine prohibited by law any public manifestation of communist and Nazi ideology, so the statement that this state must be ""denazified"" is meaningless. In addition, the Ukrainian military participated in the Soviet army's victory over Nazism. Press Russian frequently catalogs nationalist (or even identity) manifestations from the ex-Soviet space as forms of Nazism/fascism. In reality, according to international experts, neo-Nazism and extremism are very important ideological currents in Russia, and especially in the Russian army, becoming tools of the Kremlin's control and manipulation of society through the mass media.
The interview published by URA.RU also contains a series of logical contradictions. If Kiev mobilizes more Russian-speakers in the army against their will, then Russia must send more troops to Ukraine to help the Ukrainians, according to the interview. In other words, killing Russophones mobilized in the army is a form of help from Russia.
In reality, for a long time the Ukrainian army was based on volunteers and soldiers originating from the west of Ukraine. Between 2014 and 2022, many Ukrainians from the west died in the fighting in Donbass, who voluntarily joined the army. After Russia's launch of the large-scale invasion against Ukraine, Kiev made the decision to compel men who have the status of internally displaced persons to register compulsorily after a few days of stay at the military commissariat. This registration does not mean a mandatory mobilization, but it allows Kiev to evaluate its human resources in this war. The decision calmed spirits in Ukraine, reducing this internal cleavage to a minimum. The Russian press, however, built various propaganda narratives from these decisions of Kiev, according to which men with the status of internally displaced persons are persecuted, sent to the front, and women remain without any protection.
Another false narrative about the restraint shown by Russia when it bombards Ukraine to protect civilians is also mentioned, which Veridica also wrote about. In reality, since the beginning of the war, civilians have repeatedly been the target of Russian attacks, among the notable cases being the bombing of the theater in Mariupol, the railway station in Kramatorsk, the convoy near Zaporozhye, the killing of civilians in Bucea, Irpin, Kiev and others, crimes that are being investigated to bring Russia before international justice.

The unbelievable statement belongs to the lawyer Gheorghe Piperea, known for promoting several false narratives in the public space, and is based on Tarom's decision to print, on the flight tickets, the level of carbon dioxide emissions of the races for each passenger.
There will be devices that will measure how much each person breathes
NEWS: ""The trial continues with the transformation of the common man into a climate criminal. It will be infinitely worse than in the pandemic. As in the case of factories, in order to emit more than the authority allows, you will have to pay certificates. [...] We will pay to breathe, rest assured. As this is the trend, consider that for about 17 years factories and plants have been obliged to buy CO2 certificates annually if they will emit more gases than the allocated quota. [...] And the privileged are kept in the dark, being exempted or always amnestied for pollution (for example, Bayer, Pfizer, the GAFAM club). If it was possible against factories, it will also be possible against individuals. If you are wondering how it will be established to exceed the allocated limit through too enthusiastic breathing, excessive rests or winds against the law, don't do it anymore. Thermal scanners were used in the plot so that we, the laymen unaware of the secrets, would be selected by the great specialists, the security guards at the mall, as ""safe"" customers.
NARRATIVE: People will be taxed on the carbon dioxide emitted through breathing.
CONTEXT: The level of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere has become a concern of specialists since the 50s of the last century. Since 1958, the level of CO2 began to be measured constantly, thus observing an average annual increase in its presence in the atmosphere and, according to the data published in the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, it reached, in 2021, 149% of the level of the pre-industrial era. The main sources of this increase are emissions from burning fossil fuels and cement production. As a result, there is concern that, in the near future, the terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems will no longer have the capacity to effectively absorb the surplus of CO2, and to act as a buffer against the increase in temperature. As a result, the fight against global warming has become extremely important and of maximum interest to more and more people, who are looking to significantly reduce their ecological footprint.
The Covid19 pandemic and Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine have represented two topics that over the last three years have overshadowed the fight that humanity will have to wage with global warming and its catastrophic climate consequences. As Veridica anticipated a year ago, the subject has returned to the attention of public opinion, and the fighters against the ""sanitary dictatorship"" are regrouping on the front of climate denialism. Moreover, a report published in January by the coalition for Combating Climate Disinformation and carried out by a team of experts coordinated by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, finds that in 2022 there was an explosive increase in climate denialism on social networks.
OBJECTIVE: Increasing the level of indignation towards the authorities, provoking protests and revolt movements against European and local institutions.
Human breathing is not a factor in climate change
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Since 2019, surveys have shown that people want to know the exact level of emissions generated when they travel, although formulas for calculating it have existed since 2008. Western railway companies display, on the issued tickets, the level of CO2 emissions for years. As for flights, starting in 2021, search results on Google Flights will show users the amount of carbon emissions of trips, so that a buyer can consider the environmental footprint in the same way as they do with price and duration. The initiative was implemented by the big airlines already that year, and recently, Tarom chose to do the same, although, in essence, the amount of CO2 emissions of an airplane is very little influenced by the number of passengers. Its individual identification on the ticket is rather a measure of increasing the degree of awareness among the population of the impact it has on the planetary ecosystem.
Currently, airlines flying in Europe must present permits from the EU carbon market to cover their carbon dioxide emissions. Most of these (over 80%) are offered by the European community for free. Wanting to put some pressure on the aviation sector to move it away from fossil fuels, the European Parliament decided to gradually reduce the number of free carbon permits, with
25% in 2024, with 50% in 2025, until their complete elimination by 2026. This will mean that airline operators will have to pay for their CO2 permits, thus being incentivized to pollute less, which will leads, most likely, to an increase in plane ticket prices. But obviously, this does not imply an individual tax on the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere through breathing.
Moreover, scientists say that human breathing is not a factor in the climate changes generated by greenhouse gas emissions, since the carbon dioxide removed enters a natural circuit, which includes CO2-absorbing plants. On the other hand, the carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of fossil fuels is additional and accumulates in the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse effect.
NUTS OF TRUTH: A possible source of inspiration for the false narrative regarding the oxygen tax would be the fact that for many years there have been so-called ""oxygen bars"", presented either as a solution to escape, for a while, from excessive pollution (in cities like New Delhi), either for recreational purposes or in the name of benefits of oxygen therapy (which however belong to the area of ​​alternative medicine). In the respective bars, which are private initiatives, customers pay a fee to consume oxygen. Publication / Media:

In reality, he only spoke about the Russian soldiers who invaded Ukraine and must be stopped, without mentioning the Russian people or the Russian speakers in the Ukrainian regions.
Russian propaganda: Kiev threatens the Russian people with a genocide of large proportions
NEWS: ""The Kiev regime has exceeded all limits and intends to organize a genocide of the Russian people. The need for such a genocide of such proportions and carried out very quickly was argued by Mihailo Podoliak, adviser to the head of the Zelenski Administration. On the show ""We are Ukraine"" of a television station, the Nazi called for the destruction of thousands of Russians a day. He says that this is the only way in which Kiev will be able to achieve victory in the war.
""We must not have 1,000 funerals for Russia per day, but 2,500, 3,000 or even 5,000. Only in this way will the completion of this war take place. Only destruction, destruction and destruction,"" said Podoliak, requesting new tanks, planes and missiles for Ukraine.
[...]
Podoliak's words were commented by publicist Armen Gasparian. He believes that the Ukrainian nationalists surpass the Hitlerite fascists in their wickedness. ""Even the Nazi Einsatzgruppen did not intend to carry out such terrible murders in the past.""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine will organize a genocide of Russians, with the planned daily killing of 5,000 people.
The statements of Zelensky's advisor refer to the Russian military that invaded the Ukrainian state
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the adviser to the President of Ukraine, Mihailo Podoliak, analyzed the possibility of ending the war in Ukraine through the prism of the dynamics of the battles on the front. He said that Moscow brought a lot of soldiers to the territory of Ukraine, mobilized in the fall of last year, that's why in order to achieve a victory in the war, the Ukrainian army must kill between 2,500 and 5,000 occupiers per day, and not 1,000 as at the time of face. This calculation was made by Podoliak at the request of Ukrainian journalists who asked him when the war will end. The estimate regarding the current losses of the Russians belongs to Podoliak and Veridica could not verify it from independent sources.
The Russian government press took Podoliak's statement out of context and did not mention that he spoke about the Russian soldiers who arrived on the territory of Ukraine.
Zelensky's adviser did not speak about the Russian people or Russian speakers, but about the need to improve the efficiency of the Ukrainian defense against the invaders sent to Ukraine by the Kremlin. Russian propaganda presents the invaders as victims of Kiev's actions, and Ukraine is shown as a part of the conflict that does not defend itself, but only aggresses the Russian people. The purpose of this propaganda narrative is to justify the war in Ukraine and presented the Ukrainian state as a danger to the existence of Russia.
It should be mentioned that Ukraine's actions correspond to the norms of international law. In accordance with the UN Charter, Ukraine exercises its inherent right of self-defense against Russian aggression. According to a report of the Council of Europe, Ukraine has the right to liberate all occupied territories within its internationally recognized borders and to regain full control over them. Self-defense and the liberation of one's own territories cannot take place without killing the soldiers of the aggressor state.
The accusations regarding the genocide carried out by Ukraine are devoid of any legal basis and evidence. In reality, it is Russia that has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. Moscow is bombing Ukrainian towns and has destroyed numerous civilian targets, including apartment buildings, schools, power plants, etc. The crimes are documented by journalists and independent investigators. Some evidence (satellite images, drone footage) unequivocally attests that the Russian military committed war crimes in the Kiev, Kherson or Kharkiv region. Ukraine asked the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send investigators to gather evidence of war crimes.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that were launched with the aim of exonerating Russia and blaming Ukraine or the West for committing war crimes. According to Russian propaganda, the EU hides its involvement in the crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine by establishing a special court.
The Russian press also wrote that the American experts consider that the news about the atrocities of the Russian military in Ukraine are an invention of the Ukrainian propaganda. The propaganda narrative was also dismantled, according to which the UN admitted that the Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for military purposes. Publication / Media:

In reality, Zelenski's message is taken out of context, he is speaking for the Russian military who participate in the invasion without having ""yachts and banks"".
Russian propaganda: Zelensky laughs at poor Ukrainians
NEWS: The President of Ukraine made an unexpected statement. The politician cannot understand what the citizens of his country are fighting for. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky finally presented his own thoughts. He spoke without the help of prompters from the West, his speech being a spontaneous one. The citizens of the Ukrainian state who are taken to the front were also amazed. In the end, even the president of Independent Ukraine does not understand what they are fighting for.
""Do any of you have oil rigs?"" Do you have palaces? Do you have a living? Or maybe you have yachts or a bank? What are you fighting for? You only have loans, something to eat in the evening and now the mobilization,"" said Zelenski. The video of his speech became viral on the networks.
NARRATIVE: Zelenski mocks the Ukrainians who fight against Russia.
Reality: Zelensky addressed the Russian military, trying to convince them that it is not worth fighting in a foreign country
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the president of Ukraine has never disparaged his fellow citizens who are fighting against the aggression of the Russian Federation. On the contrary, during the last year, Zelenski tried, through his speeches, to encourage resistance and raise the morale of the military, but also of the civilians. The main messages of Volodymyr Zelensky were, every time, that Ukraine needs the help of the West and that Russia will be stopped by the fearless Ukrainian people.
The words quoted by the Russian press belong to Volodymyr Zelensky, but they do not refer to Ukrainians, but to Russians. The propaganda narrative is built on the basis of a video message of the Ukrainian president from the fall of last year, in which he asked the Russian military, in Russian, to stop, not to give their lives for Vladimir Putin and the great rich of Russia. He asked the Russians if they have ""palaces, vineyards, yachts or banks"" to fight for on the territory of Ukraine? Zelensky also urged the Russians to fight for localities in their country and not to accept being sent to the territory of a foreign state.
The message was published on the official communication channels of President Zelensky on September 28, 2022, but it was used by Russian propaganda only a few months later with the aim of discrediting the Ukrainian authorities and blocking the process of enlisting in the Ukrainian army, as well as exploiting to the maximum the effects of war fatigue in Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news distributed by the Russian press with the aim of manipulating public opinion regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine, while the mothers and wives of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat are protesting the war. The Russian press wrote that Zelenski killed over 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army, and the EU states will ask Ukraine to surrender to Russia. Publication / Media:

In reality, the EU did not send in the past and does not participate even now in military actions on the territory of Ukraine.
The spokeswoman of the Russian MFA, Maria Zaharova, says that the EU has soldiers in Russia
NEWS: ""The spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said that the European Union sent soldiers to Ukraine long before 2022. Zakharova wrote about this on her Telegram channel, commenting on the statement of the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, according to which ""the European Union has not considered and is not considering the possibility of sending soldiers to Ukraine"".
""The army of the EU member states has been sent to Ukraine for a long time. And in the form of instructors, and in the form of special services and in the form of mercenaries. Their sending started long before 2022"", said the diplomat.
Previously, Maria Zakharova stated that the EU-Ukraine summit held in Kiev confirmed that Brussels continues to support the neo-Nazis in Kiev who serve the interests of the United States and NATO to weaken the Russian Federation"".
NARRATIVE: The EU sent troops to Ukraine before 2022 to weaken Russia
Reality: the EU states have excluded the option of sending troops to Ukraine because they want to avoid a direct conflict with Russia
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the EU has not sent and does not intend to send soldiers to the territory of Ukraine to support the Ukrainian army. The spokeswoman of the Russian MFA justifies her state's invasion of Ukraine, continuing the propaganda metanarrative launched last fall, according to which Moscow is fighting NATO and the EU on the territory of the Ukrainian state. The Russian press has reported in the past about foreign mercenaries on the territory of Ukraine, but without providing evidence.
The head of European diplomacy declared on February 5 that Ukraine deserves support, but without the direct military involvement of the EU member states. ""Non-military behavior means not directly participating in the war. We would have been part of the conflict if we had introduced the troops, which was never on our agenda,"" Josep Borrell told ""El Pais"".
Instead, Zaharova declares that the military and instructors from the EU states are in Ukraine a long time before, but this time too she does not provide any evidence. In fact, the West began sending defensive weapons to Ukraine around the time of the war and in the context of concerns expressed by secret services abroad that Moscow was preparing to invade. Armament deliveries on a larger scale took place only after the February 24 invasion and even then, initially, it was mainly about individual and portable armaments, precisely because there were fears that Russia might consider itself provoked by armaments hard.
After the invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops, the International Legion was founded, in which soldiers from 55 countries of the world, including Russia and Belarus, fought. According to the spokesman of this legion, Damen Magru, the participation of the fighters in the war has an individual character, all soldiers being subordinated to the Ukrainian command. There are no other foreign combat units on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU has been supporting Ukraine since the first days of the war. In addition to humanitarian and financial aid, some EU states take care of the training of the Ukrainian military, provide technique and equipment. The training of the Ukrainian military does not take place on the territory of Ukraine, but in the European states, which means that the foreign instructors are not in the conflict zone. The EU finances the armament of Ukraine, necessary for an effective defense against the aggression of the Russian Federation.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine, according to which the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. During the military actions, Russian journalists reported that the inhabitants of the Zaporizhia region were waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion starting from November 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

The meta-narrative of Ukrainian Nazism has been used by Russia to justify its aggression against the neighboring country since 2014, although right-wing extremists are politically irrelevant in Ukraine and Nazi ideology is prohibited by law.
NEWS: The recruitment of volunteers in the Nazi troops was announced in Kiev. The formation of some nationalist brigades, called the ""Offensive Guard"", was announced according to the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, quoted by the PolitNavigator correspondent. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine is dealing with the formation of additional brigades within the National Guard, the National Police and the Service State border.
Among the Nazi brigades in which volunteers can register are Azov, Cervona kalina, Liuti and others
[...]
""Complete the volunteer survey and join the assault brigades of the MAI, which will liberate the cities of Donetsk, Lugansk and other occupied territories, including Crimea [...]"", says the ""Offensive Guards"" page.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine recruits volunteers in some Nazi brigades.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine announced that it is looking for volunteers to form brigades to participate in the liberation of territories occupied by the Russians. It is about 8 brigades, each with its own name, which refers to key moments of the Russian invasion starting with 2014: ""Burevii"", ""Cervona Kalina"", ""Kara-Dag"", ""Rubij"", ""Spartan"" ""Azov"", ""Liuti"" and ""Stalevii Kordon"". It should be noted that, in many armies of the world (including the Romanian army) the military units have names that can relate to history, geography, tradition, etc. The Russian press seeks to promote the idea that the use of the names of some ""Russian"" territories is a proof of nationalism and Nazism. In reality, it is about Ukrainian territories invaded by Russia.
The so-called ""Offensive Guard"" would, at the same time, operate in support of the army. There is no question, therefore, of Nazi or nationalist para-military formations.
In fact, since July 2015, Ukraine has prohibited by law any public manifestation of communist and Nazi ideology. The far-right formations have never been in government in Ukraine, obtaining low scores in the elections.
Since 2014, the Russian government media has been intensively promoting the metanarrative ""Ukraine is a Nazi state"" to justify Russia's aggression. The Kremlin has never provided credible evidence to support its theses regarding Ukrainian ""Nazism"". For Moscow, everything that does not coincide with the ideology of the ""Russian world"" is a Nazi. One of the goals of the ""special military operation"" announced by Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 was the ""denazification"" of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine and the leadership in Kiev. According to Russian propaganda, the Ukrainians do not understand that they are freed from Russia because they are being manipulated by Kiev. Also, Moscow would show restraint when bombing Ukraine because the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. The Russian press also wrote that Volodymyr Zelenski united Europe to destroy Russia, just like Adolf Hitler, and the authorities in Kiev are massacring civilians in Donbass. Publication / Media:

The narrative is thrown onto the market after, previously, Ukrainian refugees were the target of a campaign aimed at discrediting them. In reality, international organizations and leaders welcomed the way in which the Chisinau authorities and Moldovan citizens mobilized to help the refugees from Ukraine.
NEWS: ""Ukrainian authorities have left the refugees from abroad in the lurch, and the Chisinau authorities have even less concern for Ukrainians.
A pregnant refugee kneels at an intersection in Chisinau, and a Moldovan woman offers her help.
According to the refugee, she has been waiting for help from Moldova for two months. He did not receive the aid promised by Maia Sandu, but neither did he receive money from Ukraine. Her husband serves in the Ukrainian Armed Forces."" NARRATIVE: Abandoned by their own country, Ukrainian refugees are badly treated in the Republic of Moldova
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, on February 24, 2022, more than 8 million Ukrainian refugees have left the country, according to UNHCR. Of these, over 750,000 crossed the borders of the Republic of Moldova, and on January 31, almost 109,000 (mostly children and elderly people) were on its territory, a number similar to that of Romania and Slovakia, states with financial and logistical capacities much bigger. A UNDP study, carried out in September 2022, finds that ""Moldova hosts the largest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita, which has dramatic effects on the budget"". Moreover, currently, Ukrainian refugees represent approximately 4% of the population of the Republic of Moldova, a share comparable to that of Poland, which hosts the largest number of Ukrainians fleeing the war.
The first large waves of refugees were registered shortly after the beginning of the war. Then placement centers were created, tens of thousands of people were accommodated by individuals.
On the other hand, Russian and pro-Russian propaganda from the Republic of Moldova tried several times to create a negative image of Ukrainian refugees, launching an online campaign against them. The refugees were presented as profiteers, or people who cause disorder. Veridica dismantled such fakes several times.
OBJECTIVE: To inoculate the idea that Ukraine's neighboring states, as well as the international community in general, are saturated with Ukrainian refugees who no longer receive support and are forced to beg. To induce the idea that Ukraine abandons its own citizens. To create additional pressure inside Ukraine in favor of capitulation.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Apart from the statement of the woman in the video images that she is a citizen of Ukraine, there is no proof of this. It is not clear whose passport he is presenting, it cannot be verified if he really does not receive help from the Moldovan authorities (by the way, it is not even certain that the registration was made in the Republic of Moldova) and if it is not beggar by profession"". She does not say anything about her husband who would have joined the army, as Donbasstoday writes.
Apparently, it seems to be one of the most well-known manipulation techniques - generalization - when a separate case is presented as an absolute trend or state of affairs in order to misinform the public.
The Republic of Moldova has made significant efforts, compared to its financial resources, to manage the flows of Ukrainian refugees, a fact recognized by officials and international organizations. ""The Government of Moldova has shown leadership in responding to the protection needs of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine"", UNHCR notes on its page, and the representative of the organization in Chisinau, Francesca Bonelli, stated that the Republic of Moldova is an example, including for European countries, of the way it managed the refugee crisis.
In the first six months since the beginning of the war, more than 65,000 people were registered and accommodated in the 130 provisional centers and temporary placement centers for refugees, the Single Crisis Management Center announces.
Also, the natural persons who accommodated refugees received financial support in several installments, offered by the Government and international organizations.
And from this year, refugees will receive temporary protection, which will offer them more rights and social facilities.
Approximately one thousand refugees have officially engaged in the labor field, although it is assumed that their number is several times higher, only that they work unofficially
Not only the authorities, but also Moldovan citizens, economic agents, civil society have offered and continue to offer support to refugees from Ukraine. Dopomoha.md is a mutual aid platform, created and facilitated by ""Moldova for Peace"" volunteers, coordinated by the Government, which provided aid to approximately a quarter of a million refugees.
The false narrative also ignores the cause of the waves of refugees: Russia's large-scale attack against Ukraine and the Russian military's disregard for international conventions of war, which bombed and continues to bomb civilian targets, including residential buildings, targeted refugee convoys, executed and tortured civilians. It is the Russian army that forced people to flee for their lives - and Ukraine, which is under a lot of pressure anyway, has neither the ability nor the obligation to support these internal refugees, whose situation is regulated of the UN Convention for Refugees.
NUTS OF TRUTH: It is possible that some refugees are not satisfied with the help they receive. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: The actions of the Russian military in the Kherson region are an example of human behavior.
In reality, the occupation was brutal, and many Ukrainians disappeared or were tortured
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: To build this propaganda narrative, the Russian government media quotes Vladimir Leontiev, presented as the mayor of the city of Nova Kahovka. In reality, Leontiev is not the mayor of this locality, but a member of the occupation bodies of the Russian Federation. He entered the Nova Kahovka city hall building at the same time as the Russian troops, being named ""head of the civil administration"". After Ukraine liberated the city on November 15, 2022, the Russian press began to name Leontiev mayor, inviting him on various shows to tell the Russians about ""the city occupied by Ukraine"".
Vladimir Leontiev does not represent the residents of the city, being accused by the General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine of collaborating with Russia. At the same time, the mayor of Nova Kahovka, Volodymyr Kovalenko, told in July 2022 about the terror organized by Russia against civilians. The mayor stated that people were disappearing from the streets, and some were being tortured for their political beliefs. Journalists, teachers, local councilors disappeared without a trace from the city, who were seen as a danger for the occupation authorities of Russia.
Video images from March 6, 2022 from the town of Nova Kahovka, distributed on social networks, shocked the world. Even in the first phases of the ""special operation"", Russian troops opened fire on a protest against the Russian occupation, injuring several people.
After the liberation of some towns in southern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that, in the Kherson region, the Russian army ""left behind the same atrocities as in other regions"". He promised to ""find and bring to justice every criminal"".
A team of researchers from the Humanitarian Research Laboratory within the Yale University School of Public Health published a report in November 2022 documenting 226 cases of arrests and disappearances of people from the Kherson region during the Russian occupation. Ukraine invited specialists from the West to support Kiev's efforts to document the war crimes committed by Russia. Veridica dismantled a series of fake news regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. Also, according to Russian propaganda, half of the soldiers of the Ukrainian army are foreigners, which means that NATO is participating in the war, and the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine.

In reality, digital currency is just another form of existence of money.
""Digital currency is the mark of the beast"". Orthodox fundamentalism and modern financial systems
NEWS: The so-called ""currency"" is linked to your social and territorial situation - if you don't have social credit, that means you are not a good (submissive) citizen, and if you don't use the ""currency"" in a circle with a radius of 1.5 km in which you live, is cancelled. The house, the car, the bank deposits have no value anymore, because no one can buy them. To be able to sell and buy, you must wear the mark - since it sticks you to the place where you sit like a slave and forces you to glorify everything that comes from mastery in order to survive, it is the mark of the beast.""
NARRATIVE: The global satanist occult will bring humanity under control by imposing digital currencies.
CONTEXT: On January 25, the Treasury of Great Britain published a job announcement for the position of head of the digital currency department (Central Bank Digital Currency - CBDC), which will be created in partnership with the Bank of England, an opportunity for the well-known lawyer Gheorghe Piperea - known for promoting false narratives in the public space - to bring back to the public space the narrative of the satanic plot aimed at suppressing the liberties and rights of mankind. Theories already dismantled in the pages of Veridica are combined, such as that of ""digital camps"" or that of ""ecodictatorship"" that will push humanity towards a feudal social system, to which they add a religious component, in tune with the stirrings of the sovereignist community orthodox from the last period, according to which prayer has become a crime.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing in public opinion the idea that digital currencies aim to control some occult forces over people.
Digital currencies issued and regulated by the state, just a new financial instrument
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The certainty of the introduction of a digital currency by the Bank of England is shattered from the first paragraph of the job description in the announcement: ""The successful candidate will be responsible for leading the work of Her Majesty's Treasury Department regarding a potential pound digital - a digital currency of the central bank of the United Kingdom"".
Regarding CBDCs, it is obvious that the opinions expressed by Piperea are emotional, intentionally manipulative and lacking a minimum understanding of the digital currency concept. The characteristics of a CBDC may differ depending on the objectives pursued and the chosen structural model. This means that there is no single model of CBDC, each country being able to choose, if it will choose to issue such a currency, how it will behave and what will be its uses.
The hypothesis, currently not implemented, launched by the Chinese government, to impose a period of validity of the digital yuan, is speculated totally wrongly by the lawyer Piperea when he announces the financial apocalypse and the disappearance of the concept of saving. The Chinese digital currency could have an expiration date, but this is only in order to increase the degree of use of the digital yuan among the population. People will always have the option of converting digital yuan into physical yuan, if they remain unused. In addition, the concept of digital currency expiration could be used to prevent the loss of money, if CBDCs are held on a physical medium offline. Thus, once the term of validity of the currency has expired, the central bank automatically reimburses the last registered account, even without the need for a request for this purpose. If you want a slightly forced analogy, the expiration of a bank card does not imply the loss of money, and the bank automatically issues a new one.
In principle, the success of any project depends on the degree of penetration of the society. Thus, it is almost impossible to believe that a currency with a validity period will be accepted by the population. By its very definition, the digital currency is just another form of the national currency, so that it obeys the same rules, being at the same time an obligation of the central bank towards its clients (the population) and a means of preserving value. In any case, Gheorghe Piperea ""forgets"" to mention the source of the information based on which he announces that the CBDCs will be valid, sometimes 45, and sometimes 60 days. The introduction of a digital currency does not directly follow the replacement of cash, the new form having only a complementary role, just like the bank account. Own assets will have the same fixed value as before, it being regulated by the same supply and demand mechanisms.
In essence, the implementation of a CBDC would facilitate monetary flows and centralize financial processes more efficiently, but in no case will it bring the end of the freedom that Professor Piperea is talking about. And the best evidence in this regard is the fact that the apocalyptic scenario could have been very easily staged for some time, through mobile phones and bank cards associated with them.

In reality, Zelensky said that the decision to deliver tanks by a single state is important, but insufficient, and requested the help of all Ukraine's partners.
NEWS: ""President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that the delivery of tanks to Ukraine cannot change much the situation on the front, according to an interview given to the German television station ARD, published on his Telegram channel.
The Russian army, which has thousands of tanks, is fighting against us, and no state by its decision to offer 10, 20 or 50 tanks will solve the problem. [...]
Previously, Zelenski criticized German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his indecision whether or not to send combat vehicles to Ukraine.""
NARRATIVE: Zelenski admitted that Western tanks will not change the situation on the front in Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian press took out of context Zelenski's statement about several dozen German tanks that ""can't solve the problem"", without also quoting the continuation of this phrase: ""Tanks produce an important thing: they motivate our soldiers to fight for their values, because it shows them that the whole world is with them"". The leader from Kiev added that one state cannot solve the problem, but all of them together have enormous capacities.
What Zelensky said about the Russian army is also not presented correctly. He said: ""The Russian army is fighting against us, which has thousands of tanks, but which has no fighters because they are not motivated"".
The propaganda narrative appears after the Kremlin claimed that the delivery of Western tanks to Ukraine invaded by Russian troops ""will not change anything"" in the situation on the ground. ""Such deliveries (of tanks) cannot change anything fundamental, (but) they will create new problems for Ukraine"", said the spokesman of the Russian presidency, Dmitry Peskov, accusing the Western countries of maintaining the ""illusion"" of a possible Ukrainian victory ""on the battlefield"". The fake news about Zelensky appeared as a confirmation of Peskov's statements regarding ""the illusion of a Ukrainian victory"".
In reality, Moscow is worried about the delivery by the West of some tanks to Ukraine precisely because they could change the balance of forces. The Kremlin has warned Berlin that the tank deliveries will further damage relations between Russia and Germany. Ukrainian military experts claim that Western tanks would allow Ukraine to stop the Russian offensive in several directions.
Veridica dismantled a series of false Russian narratives regarding the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine, and the United States has armed Kiev since 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine, knowing that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. In order to convince public opinion of the necessity of mobilization in Russia, the Russian press wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and a possible NATO aggression.

The deputy of the State Duma also recalled the statement of the American authorities supporting Ukraine's offensive in Crimea and Donbass. ""The Kiev regime must understand that the support of Western states will have the opposite effect to that expected by Ukraine and the authorities,"" Seremet said.
NARRATIVE: The West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the West supports Ukraine with humanitarian aid, weapons and ammunition as a reaction to Russia's aggression. The ""special military operation"" which is an act of unprovoked aggression against a neighboring state, initially aimed to change the political leadership of Ukraine and subordinate Kiev to Moscow's political interests.
The West began sending defensive weapons to Ukraine in the run-up to the invasion on February 24, 2024, in the context of concerns expressed by secret services abroad that Moscow was preparing for war. Western support for Ukraine since 2014 has been linked to the Kremlin-funded war in Donbass, and the supply of lethal weapons in large quantities to Russia's large-scale unprovoked aggression in 2022. Russian propaganda, citing pro-Kremlin politicians, he tries to achieve, not for the first time, a narrative ring: the cause is replaced by the consequence. The cause - the invasion of Ukraine - is presented in a deliberately false way as a consequence of the arms deliveries.
The Russian aggression was condemned by most of the world's states. 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine and that it is a terrorist state. A series of international mechanisms have been launched to designate Russia as a state that finances terrorism.
The UN also asked Russia to cease fire, not to attack civilians and non-military infrastructure. In November 2022, the General Assembly voted a resolution in favor of creating a compensation mechanism for the destruction caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Despite this fact, Russian propaganda continues to present Moscow's act of aggression as a necessary step to defend itself from NATO, the EU and the West. The statement of the Russian deputy is a threat to the West, a psychological pressure made in order to block the arms deliveries to Ukraine. Ukrainian specialists drew the attention of European readers that Moscow relies on a series of ""sounding boxes"" that amplify the messages of Putin, Lavrov and Medvedev, with the aim of sowing fear in the West and leaving Ukraine without support.
The purpose of this narrative is to prepare Russian society for the continuation of hostilities in Ukraine by expanding the ""theatre of war"", but also to influence the capitals of the West to stop supporting Kiev with weapons.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that had the same political goal. According to Russian propaganda, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. In order to convince public opinion of the necessity of mobilization in Russia, the Russian press wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and a possible NATO aggression. Immediately after the invasion of Ukraine, the pro-Kremlin press accused Ukraine of wanting to join NATO in order to attack Russia. Publication / Media:

[...] In Russia everything takes place according to plan - organized, quiet, without panic and noise. The intensity of the offensive increased"".
NARRATIVE: The former Prosecutor General of Ukraine morally prepares the Ukrainians for a defeat in the war
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, in his post on Facebook, Iuri Lutenko, who was the Prosecutor General of Ukraine during the time of President Petro Poroshenko, after previously being imprisoned by the pro-Russian Yanukovych regime, did not write that Ukraine they must prepare for defeat. On the contrary, he encouraged the Ukrainians to resist despite the heavy fighting in Donbass. The Russian government media built this anti-Ukrainian propaganda narrative starting from an anti-Russian post!
""We chase away the mercenaries of the Wagner group like kitchen cockroaches, we kill them not only with the help of artillery, but also with kamikaze drones. Soledar is a real trap,"" Lutenko writes, denigrating Russia's fighting methods.
At the same time, the politician, who fights in a territorial defense unit, writes that Russia is sending more and more soldiers on the offensive and has numerical superiority, and the Ukrainians must have a lot of patience because ""the war does not consist only of victorious reports of the spokesmen of power"".
The Russian press does not remember anything about these theses of Lutenko, ignoring the final message in the post: ""We will resist. We will organize a great counter-offensive. We will liberate our territory. We will win this war.""
Therefore, Iuri Lutenko did not morally prepare the Ukrainians for a defeat in the war, but on the contrary, he tried to encourage them in the face of a Russian offensive. A series of Russian publications published this fake news, adding that ""by April, Russia will defeat Ukraine on the battlefield"". The purpose of this narrative is to destroy the morale of the Ukrainians and to deepen the war fatigue, which has reached a new level. phase in the context of the bombing of the Ukrainian electrical system by Russia.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news about the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, NATO supplies Ukraine only with obsolete weapons, and the EU hides its involvement in the crimes committed by establishing a special court. The Russian press wrote that the Russophobic foreigners will have the right to tear apart Crimea and Donbass after the liberation of these territories. In July 2022, Russian journalists demonstrated that American scientists support Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. Various fake news were also released about the Government in Kiev, which expressed its distrust in its partners from the West, or about the terrorists trained in the EU, who will act against civilians in Donbass.

In reality, Ukraine needs weapons from the West to defend itself against Russian aggression in the context of continued hostilities.
NEWS: ""The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, wants to involve all the states of the world in a global nuclear war,"" said the French politician, former MEP Florian Philippot.
""Zelenski asks the states of the West to increase the quantities of supplied weapons. He wants a world nuclear war! Let's get rid of this mindless puppet quickly,"" he wrote on Twitter.
[...]
Starting from February 24, Moscow is carrying out a special military operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine. Vladimir Putin announced that the purpose of the operation is to ""defend the people who for eight years were subjected to terror and genocide by the Kiev regime"". The armed forces aim to liberate the Donbass and guarantee Russia's security.
NARRATIVE: Volodymyr Zelenski's goal is to draw humanity into a world nuclear war.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian press presents a post on Twitter by the politician Florian Philippot as the opinion of the entire French society, writing that in France, ""Zelenski's great plan of aggression was discovered"". Florian Philippot is a supporter and follower of the ideas of the president of the National Front Marine Le Pen, known as a partner of the Putin regime in France. Philippot was vice-president of the National Front and coordinator of the candidate's electoral campaign, who represented the French extreme right in the elections.
In 2017, a few weeks after the defeat of the candidate Marine Le Pen in the presidential elections, Philippot founded a new political force, called ""Patriots"", which for a period of time had the status of an NGO, with the aim of promoting nationalist ideas in French society. and Le Pen, Florian Philippot has an anti-European, Russophile and ethnocentric position.
On October 30, 2022, he accused NATO of organizing diversions at the Russian gas pipeline ""Nord Stream"", claiming that he has information that Russia is not to blame. Florian Philippot is often quoted by the Moscow press to illustrate a series of false narratives about the nature of the war in Ukraine.
On December 27, 2022, he declared that Zelensky is not supported by the American Congress because during the Ukrainian leader's speech there were only 82 out of 213 Republicans in the room. The politician is quoted by the Russian government press on various occasions.
This time, Florian Philippot says that Zelenski is an aggressor who wants to launch a nuclear world war, without mentioning Moscow's decision to invade Ukraine on February 24, 2022 or the war crimes committed by Russia on the territory of a foreign state. Ukraine, which is defending itself against Russian aggression, is presented as an invader, and Kiev's legitimate requests for armed support are shown as a desire to start a world nuclear war.
Such narratives, also identified in the past, aim to sow fear in Western societies in order to block the supply of weapons to Kiev, the nuclear threat meanwhile becoming an element of this hybrid war. It should be noted that the scaremongering with the nuclear war was also officially resumed by the former Russian president, currently vice-president of the Russian Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, who said that if Russia loses the war in Ukraine, it could trigger a nuclear war. Medvedev also warned the defense ministers of the NATO countries to take this into account when discussing the supply of weapons to Ukraine.
Moscow and the politicians loyal to Russia in the EU are trying to convince the international community that the war in Ukraine will last a long time due to the supply of weapons to Kiev, otherwise it will end very quickly, but on the basis of Russia's conditions. Therefore, the Russian propaganda, quoting pro-Kremlin politicians, tries to make a narrative ring: the cause is replaced with the consequence. The victim is shown as the aggressor, and the invader as the party defending against the offensive.
In reality, Ukraine was willing to hold peace negotiations, but gave up the idea because of Russia's ultimate demands and its attacks on civilian targets. Volodymyr Zelensky proposed a peace plan, based on the norms of international law, categorically rejected by Russia. Under such conditions, with an adversary that rejects negotiations but only gives ultimatums, Ukraine is forced to defend itself, and to defend itself it needs armaments - but it only requested Western weapons, and its partners only provided defensive armaments.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, to push it to war against Russia, and because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, the Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated by Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion in 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

In reality, most of these soldiers died, but the management does not notify the relatives in order not to pay social pensions and various allowances.
It should be noted that the Ukrainian press did not mention anything about this sad event - an obvious thing in a totalitarian state"".
NARRATIVE: The mothers and wives of the Ukrainian soldiers killed in the battles protest against the war.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: The news is broadcast by a number of news agencies in Russia, sometimes with the title ""Ukraine widows' Maidan"" or ""Widows ask Zelensky uncomfortable questions"". The purpose of this narrative is to demonstrate to the public opinion in Russia that the Ukrainians are dissatisfied with a government that does not negotiate with Russia, while the number of soldiers killed is increasing. The Russian press writes that the ""totalitarian regime"" in Ukraine has forbidden journalists to write about the protest.
In reality, a rally of the mothers and wives of Ukrainian soldiers took place in Kiev, who requested the president Volodymyr Zelensky to negotiate a prisoner exchange formula, known as ""all for all"". According to the arguments of the participants in the rally, this formula it will allow the prisoners to return home in the shortest possible time.The event in Kiev was covered by national television stations, various newspapers and press agencies.
These mass actions became traditional in Ukraine during the war, taking place in the summer and autumn of 2022. In October, the wives and mothers of the fighters at the Azovstal plant demanded that all Russian prisoners be exchanged for Ukrainian ones. This is not a protest against the war or a request addressed to Zelensky to surrender to the invaders, but a reminder to Ukrainian society, the authorities and the West that there are many Ukrainians whose fate is unknown.
The Russian press used footage and photos from these rallies to illustrate their propaganda theses about the Ukrainian people dreaming of peace, while the politicians want to continue the war to enrich themselves. Also, the narrative is used to convince the public opinion in Russia that the soldiers sent to Ukraine are registering successes on the battlefield, as a result the number of widows is increasing in Ukrainian society.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote, for example, that Zelenski killed over 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army, and the EU states will ask Ukraine to surrender to Russia. At the same time, according to Russian propaganda, American scientists support all Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace, while Ukraine is mobilizing a million soldiers, paying with human beings for Western loans.

The author, a former communist deputy, slipped into the article several false theses, intended to cast doubt on the solidity Chisinau-Bucharest relations. In reality, Romania remains the main supporter of the Republic of Moldova in the EU, but also a major commercial partner, and regardless of the political color of the government, it is the first country to support, in moments of crisis, the Republic of Moldova.
NEWS: It is considered that the Romanian politicians do not sleep at night and they are all thinking about the annexation of the Republic of Moldova, using the favorable international context and some (even if not very convincing) historical arguments. But it's not really like that.
Romanians are worried by the fact that the Moldovan authorities, who have failed in managing economic and energy security issues, want to stay in power on the back of promoting Russophobia and exploiting the ""fraternal relations"" between Moldova and Romania.
This concern led the Romanian expert on Russia, Armand Gosu, in an article for Revista 22, to an unexpected conclusion: ""Romania would team up with Hungary, playing Russia's score"". Meanwhile, Moldovan officials started talking about the need to strengthen and equip the army and to review the status of neutrality, which would not be able to ensure the necessary security in the current conditions"" NARRATIVE: The Republic of Moldova is becoming a burden for Romania, which is worried about Chisinau's belligerent position.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova and Romania have built a special relationship in the last 30 years, even if they have also gone through periods of tension, especially when the Communist Party ruled in Chisinau. Both in Bucharest and in Chisinau there are politicians, representatives of the intelligentsia and a part of the citizens who opt for the reunification of the two states, a subject that has not been officially discussed. Romania was the first state to recognize the Independence of the Republic of Moldova, and is currently a supporter of its European integration.
However, the Russian and pro-Kremlin press in the Republic of Moldova, as well as pro-Russian politicians, present Romania as a revanchist state and the union as an ""imminent danger"". The narrative primarily targets the ethnic minorities, but also the so-called Moldovanists (many among them ex-Soviet nomenclators or close to them), who are scared of the ""Romanian gendarme"" and Western moral decay, also associated with the European integration of the Republic of Moldova.
The comment from ng.ru, written by a former communist deputy, seems to overturn the propaganda about the unification and arming of the Republic of Moldova by NATO and Romania, in order to prepare it to go to war against Russia, as well as a multitude of articles about Romania's intention to annex the Republic of Moldova and even a part of Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: The new narrative seems to be linked to a more important theme for Russian propaganda, namely the West's tiredness to help Ukraine. The objective is to present, in the present case, the government from Chisinau as an increasingly warlike one, which has lost control and is pushing the country into isolation. At the same time, a message is being sent to the Russian public that the ""enemies"" of Russia are losing their unity, are disunited, and Ukraine and the countries that support it (in the present case, the Republic of Moldova) are abandoned by their international partners.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: First of all, the Republic of Moldova and the government in Chisinau have never had a militaristic or pro-war attitude. Chisinau condemned the military intervention, and later started talking about the need to strengthen the country's defense capabilities, but no reference was made to renouncing the status of neutrality. Chisinau's message is that the Republic of Moldova needs a modern and well-equipped army, which does not mean renouncing the status of neutrality, as President Maia Sandu declared on public television at the end of December.
The Republic of Moldova and Romania have become even closer in the last year, as Bucharest helped Chisinau to manage the flow of Ukrainian refugees, delivered electricity to it last fall, after Russia reduced gas deliveries and destroyed the Ukrainian energy system, diplomatically supported the Republic of Moldova obtaining the status of a candidate country for EU accession, was among the organizers of an international platform through which the Republic of Moldova received foreign assistance assurances of approximately 1.4 billion euros.
""I wanted to come to Chisinau, at the end of the year, to convey a strong message of support for all the citizens of the Republic of Moldova. Romania stands by and is ready to offer all the necessary support and solutions to face the challenges,"" said the Romanian Foreign Minister, Bogdan Aurescu, during his visit to the Republic of Moldova at the end of December.
And the quote by the Romanian expert Armand Gosu that ""Romania would team up with Hungary, interpreting Russia's score"" is taken out of context. Armand Gosu was actually talking about Romania's relations with Ukraine and did not in any way refer to the Republic of Moldova or its relations with it. Publication / Media:

In reality, she encouraged the aspiration towards energy independence of the Western states, stating that the EU risks going into recession due to Russian aggression, but also other factors.
NEWS: ""European states that want to become independent from Russia in the field of energy will face a hard winter this year,"" said the general director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, in an interview for CBS.
Georgieva mentioned that the situation in Ukraine ""hit the EU very hard"" and predicted that half of the member states will go into recession.
""We analyze Europe's reaction to the energy shock and notice that the states are moving towards independence from supplies from Russia. But a hard winter is coming, and the next one will be even harder,"" she said.

As Vladimir Putin stated, the policy of containing and weakening Russia is a long-term strategy of the US and its allies, but the sanctions have had a significant impact on the world economy. The main goal of the West is, according to the Russian president, to worsen the lives of millions of people"".
NARRATIVE: Because of Ukraine, the EU states will go into recession, and without Russian energy they will not last.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Russian government media is manipulating public opinion, selectively using quotes from an interview given by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva to CBS NEWS. The coordinator of the largest financial organization in the world did not blame Ukraine, predicting a recession in the EU states. She said that the economic problems were deepened by the Russian aggression on the Ukrainian state. The Moscow press omitted a series of important fragments from the interview, calling the war in Ukraine a ""situation"", ""crisis"", ""conflict"" or ""misunderstanding"". The impoverishment of European citizens is explained by the ""situation in Ukraine"", as if Russia is not to blame.
Moreover, the West is once again criticized for having unilaterally introduced sanctions against Russia, the purpose of which is to ""make life worse for millions of people"", and not to stop the military invasion of Ukraine, as it is in reality The EU has explained more than once that it imposed a series of new sanctions against Russia in response to the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 and the illegal annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine. the measures imposed on Russia since 2014 as a result of the annexation of Crimea and the non-implementation of the Minsk agreements. The purpose of the sanctions is to economically weaken the aggressor in order to pacify him, in accordance with the norms of international law.
Kristalina Georgieva's statements regarding the problems the EU will face during the winter were also taken out of context. According to the Russian media, the head of the IMF understands that the attempt of Western states to be energy independent from Russia will create problems for them, because the winters will be harder. In reality, Georgieva declared: ""True, it will be a hard winter, maybe next winter will be even harder, but we are getting closer to the freedom of not being dependent on Russia anymore"". So, the words of the IMF director general were not a scarecrow for the EU, as the Russian press wrote, but as an encouragement. Besides, the reality also contradicts the Russian theses regarding the energy crisis - at least for now, thanks to the mild winters, the European gas deposits are almost full, and the amount of energy obtained from other sources has increased significantly.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news from the Russian media regarding the impact of the war in Ukraine on the West. According to Russian propaganda, the Germans are disappointed by the EU's decision to financially support Ukraine, and the French categorically reject the policy of sanctions against Russia and the assistance given to Kiev. In July 2022, Russian propaganda ""proves"" that American scientists support Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. The Russian press also wrote that foreign diplomats are withdrawing from Kiev for fear of a Russian offensive. Various fake news about the Government in Kiev were also launched , who expressed his distrust in the partners from the West, or about the terrorists trained in the EU, who will act against civilians in Donbass.

In reality, the Ukrainian army has modern Western weapons with with whose help he managed to liberate a number of districts in the south-east and north-east of the country.
NEWS: ""NATO states, led by the USA, supply the Ukrainian armed forces with outdated military equipment to fill their own warehouses with the latest weapons,"" writes Jacek Tochman, columnist at Niezalezny Dziennik Polityczny.
""Military aid from the West reaches Ukraine permanently. Most of the weapons are in a bad technical condition. The military equipment has many problems, being scrap metal and garbage, which is confirmed by the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine"", the article says.
Experts from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) also confirm that most of the weapons come to Ukraine from old military stockpiles. All this is done to fill the empty warehouses of the EU and the US with new weapons, the newspaper writes.
""Cleaning the warehouses of such weapons is beneficial for the West. First of all, the modernization of the own arsenal takes place. And while the EU and the United States clean out their warehouses, the Armed Forces of Ukraine must use what they are given,"" the article says.
NARRATIVE: NATO supplies Ukraine only with obsolete weapons.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, thanks to the supply of modern weaponry by the West, Kiev managed to liberate a number of localities. The technological difference was immediately felt on the battlefield. In 2022, the Ukrainian press analyzed the quantity and quality of the weaponry offered by the West to Ukraine, reaching the conclusion that the Ukrainian army is totally dependent on the military support of its partners. Compared to the reserves of the Ukrainian army exhausted in April-May 2022, the weapons in the West are much more modern.
In fact, the dismantling of this news is done by the Russian press itself, which wrote in the fall of 2022 in other articles that the USA sent the most modern weapons to Ukraine, some of them being tested on the battlefield. A few months later, this narrative was abandoned. In November 2022, the Russian press wrote that the Ukrainian army has had the most modern weapons since 2014, in order for it to ""start a war with Russia"". Therefore, Russia's propaganda theses contradict each other.
The military adviser in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Serhiy Kuzan, said that Ukraine received a lot of modern weapons, and some types of equipment are being tested for the first time on the battlefield in Ukraine. The expert confirmed that without the military support from the West, Ukraine would not have resisted.
The Russian press built this false narrative by citing a virtually unknown Polish website. The initial news was written by a journalist who cannot be found on social networks and is not listed as an author in other publications. Most of the articles are taken over and have an anti-Western character. On the page of the article quoted by the Moscow press we find comments like: ""Russian propaganda on the territory of Poland, shame"". The Russian press adds that the International Institute for Peace Research in Stockholm (SIPRI) shows that most of the weapons come to Ukraine from military reserves of the West, which is not proof that the weapons are obsolete. The warehouses are emptied after the weapons are supplied, then they are filled again.
This news is a continuation of a false narrative, launched before the invasion of Ukraine, according to which the military equipment received by Ukraine from Great Britain and the United States is outdated or expired. In January 2022, the Russian press wrote that the NLAW and Javelin systems were sent to Ukraine because London no longer needs them. The operating period of these missiles expires, and sending these weapons to Ukraine is rather a method of getting rid of them, according to Russian propaganda. Military events from February-March 2022 showed that thanks to this weaponry the Ukrainian army managed to defend its capital, drive out the invaders from the city of Kharkiv, Javelin and NLAW becoming a scarecrow for Russian tanks and armored cars.
Veridica also debunked other fake news about the nature of Western support for Ukraine. According to the pro-Kremlin media, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press wrote that the Government in Kiev expressed its mistrust in its partners from the West, adding that terrorists are being trained on EU territory who will act against civilians in Donbass. Propaganda tried to convince public opinion that the West is asking Kiev to give in to Moscow, while Ukrainian refugees are housed in former Nazi concentration camps. Publication / Media:

In reality, the Ukrainian leader spoke about the projects to restore Ukraine to which some foreign companies should be invited. There is no question of ""Russophobia"" or ""tear apart"", as Russian propaganda claims.
NEWS: ""Zelenski promised to allow Russophobic foreigners to tear Crimea and Donbass apart. After the liberation of Crimea and Donbass, it will be absolutely right for the foreign companies that during the special military operation entered the Ukrainian market or left the Russian market to participate in the reconstruction works, mentioned the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy during his speech before the Verkhovna Rada regarding the foundations of Ukrainian foreign and domestic policy [...]
We need to find a format that will allow these companies to benefit from more opportunities in such projects of rebuilding the new Ukraine: Ukrainian, American, French, Polish businesses, as well as others that are with us now,"" said Zelenskiy.
NARRATIVE: Russophobic foreigners will have the right to tear Crimea and Donbass apart after the liberation of these territories.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The propaganda narrative is based on the intentional misrepresentation of Zelensky's message to the Verkhovna Rada. In his speech, the president of Ukraine spoke about the project to restore Ukraine after the continuous bombings by Russia, drawing attention to the need to encourage companies that were in solidarity with the Ukrainian state, leaving the Russian market, or those that did not leave the Ukrainian state despite the war. Dismantling this news can be done based on the video clip posted on the same page of the Russian publication. Politnavigator inserts in the article a fragment of Zelenski's speech that does not coincide with the propaganda narrative, but the video material was titled ""Zelenski promised to allow Russophobic foreigners to tear apart Crimea and Donbass"". However, we do not find anywhere in this video material such a promise.
In fact, Russian propaganda resorted to a classic method of distorting the truth in this case as well. The headline of the news has nothing to do with Zelenski's message, and the introduction to the article incorrectly quotes Zelenski twice.
In reality, Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke about restoring Ukraine, including Donbass and Crimea, and not about ""tear-up"". Zelenskiy did not mention the ""special military operation"" anywhere, but spoke about war, aggression, invasion, Russian terrorism to. After this wrong quote with unnatural additions, the Russian press publishes the correct speech of Zelensky in Ukrainian, without translating it, in which we do not find any information about Russophobic foreign companies, about special military operation or about tearing up some territories.
The purpose of this narrative is to deepen the distance between Kiev and the inhabitants of the occupied territories by presenting the projects to restore the Ukrainian regions based on Western financing as initiatives of division, directed against Russian speakers.
The false narrative fits into the meta-narrative about Ukraine and the West organizing a genocide against Russian-speakers in Crimea and Donbass, and Zelenskiy's idea to encourage foreign businesses that have not left the Ukrainian state despite the war is presented, without any evidence, as a danger for Russian speakers.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that were aimed at proving to the public opinion in the east and south of the country that Ukraine hates them and aims to massacre them. The Russian press also wrote that only Russian speakers from the east are being mobilized in Ukraine because they want to exterminate them. Another news item was published, according to which, due to Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion in November 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West during 2022.

The narrative, as well as others, is related to climate denialism and conspiracy theories according to which global warming is an invention intended to justify the establishment of the so-called ecodictatorship.
NEWS: Oxford wants to be the first city in Europe to massively restrict people's freedom of movement. You are only allowed to move where you can walk in 15 minutes. For anything else, we will need authorization from the city administration. Everything is monitored with barriers and cameras.""
NARRATIVE: In the future, people will be forbidden to leave their place of residence, cities will be turned into prisons and labor camps.
CONTEXT: The Covid19 pandemic and Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine have represented two topics that over the last three years have overshadowed the fight that humanity will have to wage with global warming and its catastrophic climatic consequences. As Veridica anticipated a year ago, the subject has returned to the attention of public opinion, and the fighters against the ""sanitary dictatorship"" are regrouping on the front of climate denialism. Activenews.ro, the well-known website promoting conspiracy theories and fake news, makes a summary prophetic of the measures that will be taken by the leaders of the world and that will ultimately lead to the enslavement of the population.
OBJECTIVE: Inciting civil disobedience and social revolt against the authorities for electoral purposes, reducing and even stopping actions that affect economic interests and businesses from polluting activities.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the local authorities in Oxford will implement, from January 1, 2024, the concept of the ""15-minute city"", already present in large metropolises such as Paris, Barcelona, ​​Buenos Aires or Melbourne.
This residential urban concept provides that most daily needs (supply of food and medicine, visits to the family doctor, going to school, etc.) can be fulfilled either by walking or by bicycle, in very short times. The concept experienced intense popularization in the 2020 electoral campaign of the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, and claims that everyone who lives in a city should have access to essential urban services 15 minutes from home.
One of the main objectives of the implementation of this concept aims to reduce car traffic and, implicitly, reduce the pollution caused by them. In no case does it target the free movement of people, who are encouraged to use public transport, bicycles or walking. The benefits of this lifestyle start from having more free time at your disposal to those related to physical and mental health, cleaner air, quality green space and stronger ties with the community. For example, an area adapted to this concept becomes a much more favorable environment for the development of small local businesses that the sovereignists urge us to support. Referring to the concrete case of Oxford, the installation of road barriers between six areas of the city has the purpose of minimizing the access and transit of cars through the city center, not of people. To cross the city with a personal car, those who want to will have to pay a rather high fee or choose a detour route, consuming time and fuel, exiting the city belt and then re-entering the destination area. People will still be able to move freely, the only constraint being that of doing it in a sustainable way, without polluting even more the area where they live.
NUTS OF TRUTH: Several cities around the world are looking for solutions to implement the ""15-minute city"" concept to reduce pollution and combat climate change caused by global warming more effectively. Publication / Media:

In reality, the EU did not commit any crime on the territory of Ukraine, but supported Kiev's defensive efforts in the face of Russian aggression.
NEWS: The European Union is trying to hide its involvement in war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, initiating the creation of a special court, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Serghei Versinin, told RIA Novosti.
Moscow, according to the diplomat, is not surprised by the discussions of the anti-Russian delegations at the UN, including the EU states regarding the creation of an ""international tribunal"" against Russia.
""These Russophobic states are willing to violate the UN Charter, especially the articles that prohibit involvement in the internal affairs of the states of the world. The EU, which participates in providing funding of billions of dollars for the supply of armaments to Ukraine, is trying to hide its own involvement in the commission of war crimes by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"" the diplomat said.
This ""absurd initiative"", emphasized Versinin, will have no legal consequences and will become ""a legal nonsense"". ""The creation of this tribunal, or more correctly, this pseudo-tribunal, without the participation of our state and its agreement, is legal nonsense, and its decisions, if they exist, will never be recognized"", he emphasized.
NARRATIVE: The EU hides its involvement in the crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine by establishing a special court.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: At the end of November, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the EU will establish a special court to try ""Russia's crimes in Ukraine"". ""Continuing to support the international criminal court, we propose the establishment of a specialized court, supported by the United Nations, to investigate and judge the crimes committed by Russia through aggression,"" Von der Leyen said. For now, there is no definitive decision to create such a court; discussions are still taking place at the EU level.
The EU's idea of ​​a tribunal for crimes in Ukraine does not violate the UN Charter. Beyond the fact that such a tribunal would be supported by the UN member states to help the International Criminal Court during investigations, the UN Charter does not prohibit the establishment of tribunals. In the case of collaboration with UN bodies, the decisions of these tribunals produce international legal effects. On the other hand, military aggression against a sovereign state is prohibited and severely condemned. Such an aggression was launched by Russia in 2014 and went to the stage of a large-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. Russia is bombing Ukrainian towns, and has destroyed numerous civilian targets, including housing blocks, schools, power plants, etc. The crimes are documented by journalists and independent investigators. Some evidence (satellite images, drone footage) unequivocally attests that the Russian military committed war crimes in the Kiev, Kherson or Kharkiv region. Ukraine asked the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send investigators as soon as possible to gather evidence of war crimes. The victims in Ukraine are caused by the Russian invasion, not by the decision of the Ukrainian leadership to organize a state defense and request the help of the EU states.
Kiev is supported by a number of EU states that want to help the Ukrainian investigators. For example, after the international community found out about the massacre in Bucea, the French government made the decision to grant international judicial and police assistance for the detection and collection of evidence of the war crimes committed in Ukraine by Russia, and the Russian press immediately distributed a propaganda narrative about the French gendarmes who will hide the traces of the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea.
The MFA in Moscow, through the Russian government media and various Telegram channels, distributed - without presenting any evidence - a false narrative about the involvement of the EU in committing these crimes, but not directly, but through the Armed Forces of Ukraine, supported from the West.
Moreover, in order to absolve Russia of guilt, the pro-Kremlin press also wrote that the Ukrainian military are neo-Nazis and commit war crimes against civilians in the east and south of Ukraine with the help of weapons received from Western countries.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that were launched with the aim of exonerating Russia and blaming Ukraine or the West for committing war crimes. In April, the Russian press wrote that American experts believe that the news about the atrocities of the Russian military in Ukraine are an invention of Ukrainian propaganda. The propaganda narrative was also dismantled, according to which the UN admitted that the Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for military purposes, and Zelenski announces the organization of a new genocide of Russian speakers in Kharkiv and Donbass.

NEWS: ""In Great Britain, a woman was arrested on suspicion of praying ... in thought. She is sent to court and risks up to two years in prison, because she confessed that she prayed (I repeat, in my mind), and that near a clinic where abortions were performed, a place where, apparently, it is forbidden to pray , whether and (or maybe especially, who knows?) in thought.""
NARRATIVE: The New World Order aims to destroy Christianity, the last bastion of resistance against satanic domination.
CONTEXT: Conspiracy theories amplified by disinformation campaigns launched primarily by Russia try to validate the idea that there are various occult conspiracies to subjugate humanity and distance it from Christianity. Narratives along these lines can be found in conspiracy theories like PizzaGate and QAnon, in the Russian propaganda discourse regarding Gayropa, in the fierce opposition to biological passports (or to vaccination certificates and QR codes during the Covid-19 pandemic), in the news falsehoods regarding the banning of Christmas by the EU, in the populist speeches that plead for the ""traditional family"". Almost any event, no matter how insignificant, can be linked to the ""persecution of Christians"" through ambiguous and allusive formulations or omissions of information. Theories of this kind could obviously not bypass Romania, a still deeply religious and conservative country with inclinations towards extremism since the last century. The last three years have represented a veritable festival of fake news, many with Moscow origins, adapted to local ethos by opinion leaders of ultra-conservative extremist circles. The ultra-religious discourse in Romania goes hand in hand with the pro-Putinist one: Archbishop Teodosie does not consider that the Russian president is doing anything wrong, and Senator Diana Sosoaca, a declared anti-vaccinist, pleaded in the midst of the pandemic for the Russian anti-covid19 vaccine, Sputnik, and she was convinced that in Ukraine no there is no war.
OBJECTIVE: Arguing the false theory that the Christian religion is the favorite target of the world occult, increasing the confidence of followers that we are in the midst of a ""holy war"", inciting hatred and social disobedience.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Ever since 2014, British local authorities have received powers, based on the Antisocial Behavior, Crime and Police Act, to introduce public space protection orders, the so-called PSPOs (Public Space Protection Orders). They are meant to solve more effectively the unpleasantness or problems that damage the quality of life of a community. A PSPO is intended to ensure that people can use and enjoy public spaces, living safely from anti-social behaviour, and may impose conditions and restrictions on people using the specified area. The incident referred to in the news in question took place in such a space, delimited by a PSPO established around an abortion clinic, to ensure unfettered access to both clients and clinic employees, without fear of confrontations, provocations or aggression . Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, the arrested woman, is a well-known British anti-abortion activist, leader of the March for Life UK organization. Prior to the day of her arrest, she had violated the respective order, signaled by a clear display, three more times and was invited to the police station to give statements. The arrest took place after the woman's refusal to accompany the police crew voluntarily, the standard procedure for police bodies around the world. Later released, she was accused of violating the special protection order and will be tried by a local court. The fact that, during the dialogue with the present policeman, she states that ""it is possible that she prayed in thought"" has absolutely nothing to do with her arrest, just as there is no ""thought crime"" in British law.

In reality, according to the data of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, only 101 women were killed in the war, and many of those enlisted did not reach the front, but are part of the auxiliary structures of the army located in different regions of the country.
NEWS: ""Zelenski killed 50 thousand women. The Western press tried to make a nice report about the women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine [...] In the article we find an important nuance: 57 thousand women were mobilized or voluntarily registered in the armed forces. At the moment there are about 6 thousand left! Where have more than 50 thousand disappeared?!
The answer is obvious: they died, were wounded or were taken prisoner"".
NARRATIVE: Zelenski killed more than 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: The articles in the Russian media about tens of thousands of women killed in the war because of President Volodymyr Zelensky, who does not make concessions to Russia, are based on a post on the Telegram channel of the pro-Russian former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mikola Azarov, who fled to Russia in 2014. Starting from a report produced by AP News, dedicated to women in the Ukrainian army, Azarov makes an intentionally wrong mathematical calculation, saying that if there are only 6 thousand women left on the front, it means that the others, over 50 thousand, were killed, and Zelenski is to blame, who ""doesn't stop the war"".
In reality, according to the official data and explanations of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksii Reznikov, there are about 59 thousand women in the Ukrainian army, but only 5-6 thousand are in the front area. Only 38 thousand women are military personnel, the others being civilians who help the army far from the front.
Reznikov's data, in fact, coincide with those of Russian propaganda, but the Ukrainian minister explains that most women are not in the front area, they are not in the trenches, but they help the Ukrainian defense in various auxiliary structures or territorial defense units. It is about military doctors, communication specialists, accountants and others who are mobilized in the army. If there are only 6 thousand women on the front, this does not mean that the rest were killed by Russia. It is a miscalculation presented to public opinion to demoralize Ukrainian society.
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine announced at a congress of Ukrainian women that in the war 101 women were killed, 100 were wounded, and 50 are missing without a trace. Not to mention the 50 thousand women killed in this war.
The figure of 50 thousand women killed in the war is also exaggerated in the context of Kiev's protest against an EU statement, which was later corrected, about 100,000 soldiers and approximately 20,000 Ukrainian civilians killed since the beginning of the war.
The false narrative regarding the losses reappears from time to time on Telegram channels and news portals in Russia and the occupied territories to sow panic, discourage Ukrainian resistance and block Kiev's defensive efforts. In fact, both sides try to present small figures of their losses. In any case, it cannot be about hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers killed and tens of thousands of women, as the Russian government press writes. At such a level of losses, to which the wounded would be added, the Ukrainian army would no longer exist at this moment and effective counter-offensive actions were not possible.
Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives aimed at discouraging Ukrainian resistance in the war. The Russian press wrote, for example, that the EU states will ask Ukraine to yield to Russia, and American scientists support all Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace, while Ukraine is mobilizing a million soldiers, paying with human beings for Western loans.

NEWS: ""The right to carry out military operations in Crimea was offered as a gift to the Armed Forces of Ukraine by the USA and is seen in the peninsula as a declaration of war against Russia. The permanent representative of Crimea next to the presidential administration of Russia, the vice-prime minister of the Republic of Crimea, Gheorghi Muradov, mentioned the perfidy of the American scheme to wage war with our country: ""They are trained to wage war with the bloody foreign hands of the Nazis [.. .] We cannot avoid reminding Washington about our nuclear capabilities that can rise above the dumb heads of the madmen in the American capital,"" Muradov said.

Admiral John Kirby hastened by the permission offered to the Ukrainian army to bomb Crimea, because Crimea (however much the American political elite would like to think otherwise) is a territory of Russia both de jure and de facto"".
NARRATIVE: The US declared war on Russia, allowing the Ukrainian army to bomb Crimea.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: According to Russian propaganda, Crimea is a territory of Russia, so military operations in this territory would represent an aggression against Moscow to which it can respond by attacking the aggressor state. On the other hand, Russian propaganda constantly tried to involve the West (NATO, the United States) as responsible for its part of the conflict in Ukraine. Initially, an alleged NATO threat was among the pretexts invoked to trigger the war; later, against the backdrop of the defeats suffered by the Russian army in the field, Russian propaganda - which cannot admit that Moscow's army is inferior to the Ukrainian one - began to convey more and more often the thesis that, in fact, the war in Ukraine is a war with the West .
In reality, Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014, a fact condemned by the international community. According to international law, the peninsula is Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by Moscow. Kiev has every right to recover this territory by military or diplomatic means. The military operation to liberate Crimea is no different from the counter-offensive in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk or Kherson regions. Therefore, the bombing of some objectives in Crimea cannot be compared in any way with an act of aggression directed against Russia. Instead, the mere presence of Russian forces in the occupied Crimea represents an act of aggression against another state.
After the international press wrote about the Pentagon's decision to condition the supply of armaments to Ukraine by not using them in Crimea or on Russian territory, Admiral John Kirby stated that the US does not encourage Ukraine to bomb Russian territory, but admitted that Kiev has every right to recover the territories annexed by Russia, including Crimea.
Ukraine's Western partners have repeatedly emphasized that the Ukrainian army has every right to use the weapons offered on its sovereign territory. The Ukrainian army makes decisions independently of the West, so it is not coordinated by the USA, Great Britain or other states.
The USA and NATO are not parties involved in the conflict, supporting, at the same time, Kiev with weapons and humanitarian aid. From the beginning of the war until now, the United States and NATO have really tried to take all possible measures to ensure that they will not become part of the military conflict.
That is why Russia's bombing of an American city in response to Ukrainian operations is an act of aggression, not a response to an attack.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives regarding Russia's ""historic right"" over Crimea and the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia, and because neo-Nazi propaganda of Kiev, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated by Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion in 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself from a NATO aggression, being forced to save Donbass- the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

We remind you that on December 5, the Russian military launched a series of missiles against Ukraine. According to unconfirmed information, 7 infrastructure objects were affected"".
NARRATIVE: While Ukrainians sit in the cold and darkness, Kiev sells electricity to the Republic of Moldova
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukraine has stopped supplying electricity to other states since October 11. According to the government of Ukraine, energy exports are not only impossible, but also dangerous for the national electrical grid. Kiev is trying to restore its energy system damaged by Russian missiles, and the interruptions have become more frequent in the context of efforts to stabilize the situation.
 In fact, not Ukraine, but Romania supports the Republic of Moldova in this energy crisis. According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bogdan Aurescu, there were times when Romania provided the Republic of Moldova with more than 90% of the necessary electricity consumption. In the meantime, the energy crisis in the Republic of Moldova has eased as a result of an agreement by which the Transnistrian separatist region resumed electricity deliveries to the territory on the right of the Dniester, in exchange for increasing the amount of Russian gas that reaches, via Moldova, on the left of the Dniester.
Independent experts consider that Russia's actions are a true energy terrorism. At the beginning, in October, Russia bombed the substations and transformers that ensured the connection between the national and local systems, i.e. the distribution system. There were blackouts, then planned outages.
On December 8, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that Russia is bombing the Ukrainian energy infrastructure.
The Russian press tries to put false accents in this narrative, ignoring the fact that the Ukrainians are suffering as a result of attacks launched by Russia, and not as a result of alleged electricity supplies to neighboring states. Russia's guilt is bracketed, ignored, minimized, anti-Ukrainian narratives being built on the basis of crimes committed by the Kremlin. In other words, Russia is trying to convince the Ukrainians that they suffer not from the launch of hundreds of missiles against civilian targets, but from the authorities that sell electricity to neighboring states!
Vladimir Rogov, a representative of the Russian authorities in the occupied area of ​​the Zaporizhia region, is quoted by the Russian press. He fled to Russia in 2014, after speaking out against the Euromaidan, he supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass, and in 2022 he was brought by Russia as a representative of Moscow in the Zaporozhye region. He was prosecuted for collaborating with Russia. In this news, Rogov was presented as ""a Russian politician"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding Russia's energy terrorism launched against Ukraine. At the end of November, the Russian press wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. Russian propaganda tried to prove that the massacre at Izium was a staging designed to compromise the Russian army. In June, the pro-Kremlin press wrote that the Ukrainian army is massacring Russian speakers during the withdrawal from Donbass, and in July - that Volodymyr Zelenski will be tried for war crimes in Ukraine.

WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The news, which also appears under the headlines ""Germans outraged by the EU's decision to send 18 billion euros to Ukraine"" or ""Why did we connect with them? Germans have lost hope in the EU regarding with Ukraine"" presents some comments from the German newspaper Die Welt as the opinion of the entire society. In reality, in the pages of the German newspaper we find a lot of pro-Ukrainian and anti-Hungarian comments. The Russian press selected 4-5 comments favorable to the Kremlin (possibly even written by trolls paid by Moscow), ignoring the other over 500 opinions, many of them very balanced. At the same time, taking into account all the comments of the newspaper readers does not mean a real survey of the German public opinion. There are some comments translated into Russian that do not justify the headlines that appeared in the press about ""revolted Germans"" and ""citizens disappointed by the EU"".
The Russian press presents Hungary's position as one directed against the Ukrainian state, which would have no right to benefit from EU financial aid. In reality, Budapest linked these negotiations to an older dispute regarding the freezing of EU funds for Hungary. In fact, this is also mentioned in the pages of the German newspaper Die Welt, being omitted by the Russian government press.
In reality, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban refused to give his consent for the financial aid granted to Ukraine in case the recovery plan and the cohesion funds provided for his country were blocked by the EU. Budapest had refused to accept a minimum tax of 15% for large multinational corporations.
On December 13 a.c. the Czech presidency of the EU Council announced that a compromise was reached for the unblocking of EU funds for Hungary, also solving the problem of granting an assistance of 18 billion euros to Ukraine in 2023. Germany was among the supporters of this financial assistance. A poll from the summer of this year shows that 66% of Germans consider Russia to be the main responsible for the war in Ukraine, and 57% are in favor of breaking all economic ties with Russia.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine and the attitude of international organizations. Russian propaganda claims that Ukrainian politicians will go to war to make money and do not care about the suffering of the people. According to the pro-Kremlin media, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. Also, the Russian press wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. According to the false narratives of the Kremlin, Russia shows restraint in the war in Ukraine, especially when it attacks civilian targets and aims to defend all Russian speakers from the genocide committed by Ukrainians.

In fact, the sanctions are being felt in Russia on an increasingly large scale, and even if there has been a slowdown in economic growth in the West, it has not stopped.
NEWS: ""The idea to cap the price of oil in Russia represents a ""crowning"" of the sanctions so far: it does not affect Moscow, but it gives the dying Western economies the coup de grace. It can no longer be a coincidence. All the sanctions that the West -imposed on Russia so far have turned against it like a boomerang. ALL, without exception. While Russia is recording record revenues from gas and oil exports, and the ruble is more stable than ever, the West is sinking by the day. is going through the worst economic crisis since the war, without any prospect of recovery."" NARRATIVE: The European Union will face the worst economic crisis since the second world war because of the sanctions imposed on Russia. 2. The Russian Federation is stronger than ever, the Western sanctions succeeding in strengthening the Russian economy.
CONTEXT: Just one day after the start of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the European Union ratified a set of sanctions against the Kremlin, which were in addition to those in force since 2014, adopted as a result of the annexation of Crimea and the start of the armed conflict in Donbass. The purpose of the sanctions is to weaken Russia's ability to finance its war against Ukraine and to effectively counter its ability to continue aggression. In total, up to this moment, the EU has imposed on Russia eight packages of sanctions with a negative impact on the Russian economy, at the same time limiting the consequences for EU companies and citizens. The measures are designed to weaken Russia's economic base, depriving it of critical technologies and markets, without irreparably affecting the ordinary population. Thus, export and import restrictions exclude food and pharmaceutical products. Among the most important bans are those related to Russian energy exports: the ban on imports of coal and crude oil from Russia, as well as capping the price of oil at 60 dollars per barrel. Extremely sensitive in relation to major socio-political events, the energy market suffered several disturbances, initially leading to a galloping increase in electricity, natural gas and fuel prices. In the meantime, however, it stabilized, and the measures to counteract the negative effects of these increases, taken both at the community level and at the state level, reduced their impact to a minimum.
OBJECTIVE: Lowering the population's confidence in the European Union, amplifying anti-European feelings, as well as exonerating Russia for the economic and humanitarian problems facing Europe.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Already faced with a crisis generated by the covid19 pandemic, Europe was forced, at the beginning of this year, to face another crisis, this time much more severe and with greater implications. Despite this fact, the statistical data show that the European economy continues its upward trend, even if not as strong as the pre-conflict forecasts said. Thus, the EU economy will grow by 2.7% until the end of 2022 and by 1.5% in 2023. The two largest economies of the European Union, Germany and France, had increases in 2022, and if we talk about Romania, it recorded the second best economic growth in the EU, after that of the Netherlands. And for 2023, Romania's GDP is expected to grow by 2.9%.
At the same time, analyzes based on objective economic indicators, and not on assumptions, show that Russia is going through a period of deep crisis, which is felt at all economic levels. At the macro level, the Russian GDP is expected to decrease by at least 3.4% until the end of the year, and by another 2.3% in 2023, in an optimistic scenario. The sanctions imposed by the Western world produce effects even at the microeconomic level, from the modification of some sweet recipes due to the lack of key ingredients, to the decrease in Internet speed or the bankruptcy of several medium and small businesses. The Russian currency is not ""more stable than ever"", it is artificially maintained at the pre-war level by increasing lending rates, but this line of monetary defense cannot be sustained in the long term. As the sanctions will depreciate the Russian economy , experts say will eventually weigh on the ruble as well. The Central Bank of Russia will not be able to keep raising interest rates indefinitely, as this will eventually stop lending. In the event of a global economic recession, Russia and -could see exports cut even further, as demand for its products will disappear first. This could trigger an even steeper collapse of the ruble and a rise in inflation. As for oil exports, we are dealing with also with misinformation, and this is because, although the exports of crude oil and oil products of Russia have increased, the revenues obtained are lower. The main reason is the drop in crude oil prices, which is greater than the increase in exports.
In conclusion, the narratives are just another part of the Kremlin's arsenal of manipulating information and promoting disinformation about the invasion of Ukraine, with the aim of destabilizing the European Union and its member states. Although in the short term, their impact can be perceived as negative, in time, they will prove their effectiveness. In addition, all sanctions fully respect the obligations arising from international law, including human rights and fundamental freedoms. Publication / Media:

In reality, minors are prohibited from donating blood in Ukraine, but the authors of the false narrative made other errors that show that we are dealing with an invention.
NEWS: ""In a Ukrainian school in the Cherkasy region, children are forced to donate blood for the government army of Kiev. An announcement from the school management asks students from grades 6-12 to come to the nurse's office to donate blood. Each class has a reserved period in the schedule. The students were told to have the report card, water and a chocolate with them to keep in shape after the procedure.
[...]
After the EU announced that the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost 100 thousand soldiers in the war, a decline in morale is felt in the Ukrainian camp, according to military correspondents and Russian troop commanders"".
NARRATIVE: The losses of the Ukrainian army are so great that the students are forced to donate blood for the soldiers.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The photo published by the Russian press as proof of the existence of an announcement of blood donation by students for the army contains a series of technical inaccuracies that prove that it is a false narrative. First of all, in schools in Ukraine there is no 12th grade, only 11th grade. The Education Law of 2017 introduced the 12th grade, following the European model, starting with the 2018-2019 school year, which means that for the first time the 12th grade will exist in Ukraine in 2031. So, normally, an announcement this way it should be addressed to students from grades 6-11.
Secondly, another condition of the announcement cannot be fulfilled, according to which the student must have the report card with him. Identity documents are issued starting with the 10th grade, the other students only having birth certificates.
In addition, according to Ukrainian legislation, blood donation by minors is prohibited. According to a regulation, adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in 2021, people who have reached the age of 18 and whose body weight is more than 50 kilograms can be blood donors.
Ukrainian television stations encouraged citizens in the spring-summer of the current year to donate blood for the needs of the army, as sufficient blood reserves have been accumulated.
The Russian government press also cited a statement from the European Commission, in which in the initial version it was said about 100 thousand Ukrainian soldiers killed. The number was later corrected, stating that a mistake was made in the EU communique. On December 1, the Presidential Administration of Ukraine reacted, emphasizing that it cannot be a question of such a large number of victims among the military, offering a much smaller balance sheet, of 13 thousand.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aimed to demonstrate that the Ukrainian army only suffers losses, while the Russian army is supported by the local population and occupies more and more territories. The Russian press wrote that the leadership of Ukraine wants war to make money and does not care about the suffering of civilians, while only Russian speakers from the east are mobilized because they want to exterminate them. According to Russian propaganda, unemployed people from Ukraine will be drafted into the army and sent to the front, and Kiev gives money to those who trick their friends into enlisting.

In reality, the war in Ukraine is a military aggression by Russia, condemned by the international community, against a neighboring state and people.
NEWS: ""The international press is trying to convince the Russians and the Ukrainians that they are two different peoples, which is not true,"" says the deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, the representative of the United Russia party, in an interview with Ukraina.ru , the first deputy of the head of the committee for tourism and tourist infrastructure, Nicolai Valuev.
""It's a special operation (actually, it's not really a correct name, it's more of a bigger civil war). No matter how much they try to convince us that we are different, in fact we are one people,"" said Valuev [...]
The inhabitants of the planet are told that the special operation is a clash of two peoples, nations, states. In reality, we are talking about one people, and the conflict is a civil war, said the parliamentarian.
NARRATIVE: The armed conflict in Ukraine is a civil war because Russians and Ukrainians are one people.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russian propaganda returns to the narrative regarding the unity of the Russian and Ukrainian people, promoted around the invasion of Ukraine in order to justify the ""special military operation"". This time, the narrative is used to distance Russia from the image of the aggressor - being a civil war, it is an internal conflict, not an inter-state one. Therefore, the other states must not get involved in this conflict. The propaganda narrative manipulates public opinion, selectively using various political, historical and legal arguments , which justifies the military aggression and masks the war crimes committed by Russia on the territory of Ukraine.
The article is based on the metanarrative, ""Ukraine is an artificial state"". In the last two years, the Russian press has shown the reader that the two ""sister states"" are closely related to each other, and the efforts of the West to ""separate"" these former Soviet republics will not succeed. ""Ukraine cannot exist without Russia, being a creation of the USSR, and the Ukrainian language is, in fact, a dialect of the Russian language,"" according to a fake news from 2021.
On July 12, 2021, an article signed by Vladimir Putin himself was published on the Kremlin website, entitled ""On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians"". The disinformation narratives that were disseminated after the publication of this article aligned with political theses of the Kremlin leader. The article repeats the classic narrative about Ukraine as a ""fake state"". For Putin, the Europeanized Ukraine is anti-Russia, which the Russian president wants to combat in his article. Vladimir Putin considers that Russians and Ukrainians are close from a historical point of view or even they are the same people.
In reality, Ukrainians and Russians are not one people. The two languages ​​are not identical, but they are similar in proportion 62%, according to studies; the Ukrainian language is more similar to Belarusian and Polish.
After the invasion of Ukraine, the hatred of Ukrainians towards Russians and Russia reached maximum heights, and the decommunization process was completed with a policy of de-Russification and cultural decolonization.
Russia recognized the independence of Ukraine, offered security guarantees through the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, and undertook to respect its political borders. It violated its own commitments and treaties to which it is a signatory by invading and illegally annexing Crimea, financing the war in Donbass and the invasion of February 24 BC. According to international law, the war in Ukraine is a military aggression. The member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine, a series of mechanisms being launched at the international level to designate Russia as a state that finances terrorism. In November of this year, the European Parliament declared Russia a ""state sponsor of terrorism"", the Kremlin's actions being criticized for violating the norms of international law and destroying the foundations of global security.
The UN General Assembly also voted a resolution in favor of creating a compensation mechanism for the destruction - of a human and material nature - caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives regarding Russia's ""historical right"" to invade the Ukrainian state. The Russian press wrote that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, to push it to war against Russia, and because of the neo-Nazi propaganda of Kiev, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated by Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion in 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself from a NATO aggression, having to save Donbass from genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

In reality, Ukraine showed itself willing to hold peace negotiations, but gave up the idea because of Russia's ultimate demands and its attacks on civilian targets, but also against the background of the victories achieved by the Ukrainian army in the field.

[...]
The president of the Servant of the People parliamentary group, David Arahamia, announced a new condition necessary for the resumption of negotiations with the Russian Federation, which consisted in Moscow's voluntary renunciation of its nuclear arsenal, Gazeta.ru recalls.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine is interested in prolonging the war, being indifferent to the suffering of civilians.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Russian-Ukrainian military conflict cannot be in the interest of Ukrainian politicians, who are fighting hard to overcome the effects of war fatigue, caused by the destruction of the energy infrastructure, the killing of civilians, the impoverishment of the population and permanent mobilization. The false narrative also appears under the title ""The Government of Ukraine continues to benefit from the war"" or ""The press found out the real reason for Kiev's refusal to negotiate with Moscow"". An opinion article from the German newspaper ""Junge Welt"" is cited, presented as the point of view of the entire society.
The newspaper is considered to be of the extreme left, of Marxist orientation, continuing the German communist and socialist traditions. After the invasion of Ukraine, Junge Welt also published a series of articles that copied the false narratives of Russian propaganda. It is a newspaper cited by the Russian government media to illustrate their own propaganda narratives or to present them as an independent point of view. At the end of November, Ukraina.ru, quoting Junge Welt, wrote without providing any concrete evidence that Ukrainian refugees were beating the residents of Berlin who speak Russian.
In reality, the losses of society, of the Ukrainian political and economic elite following the war are enormous. The infrastructure is destroyed, the state's debts increase, and everyone's income decreases. The economic potential of the state is less and less. Large factories, refineries, enterprises of the Ukrainian oligarchs were destroyed or seriously affected, a number of economic fields stopped their activity. Economic life is put on hold. According to estimates, the destruction in Ukraine caused by the Russian bombing exceeded 137 billion dollars, increasing by 31 billion monthly. The cost of the unprovoked invasion of Russia is enormous and cannot in any way be in the interest of the government in Kiev, which is trying to maintain control over the critical situation in the country.
Also, Kiev is accused of indifference to the suffering of civilians because it refuses to negotiate with Russia. In reality, the suffering of civilians is only caused by Russia's energy terrorism and the bombing of non-military infrastructure. Russia is the one that shows indifference to the lives of civilians, creating increasingly complicated living conditions for them in the hope that they will ask Kiev to give in, which is not happening. The resistance message of the Ukrainians, valid for the winter period, became more and more popular: ""Better in the cold, but in freedom"". In addition, at this moment both sides hope to win on the battlefield, so neither is interested in serious negotiations.
Regarding the proposal of the president of the parliamentary group ""Servant of the people"" David Arahamia to Russia to give up its nuclear arsenal, this took place in a special context - around the 28th anniversary of the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, when Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from Russia and other states, which Moscow has violated.Trying to remind Russia that it is not keeping its own promises and agreements signed in the past, another member of the Zelenski team, the presidential advisor Mihailo Podoliak, said: ""Ukraine is willing to guarantee the security of the Russian Federation in exchange for the complete renunciation of nuclear weapons. We can sign an agreement in the same town - in Budapest, Hungary"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media about the nature and true causes of the war in Ukraine. Russian propaganda claims that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. Also, the Russian press wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. According to the false narratives of the Kremlin, Russia shows restraint in the war in Ukraine, especially when it attacks civilian targets and aims to defend all Russian speakers from the genocide committed by Ukrainians.

It quotes a controversial American political scientist, known for promoting numerous conspiracy theories and enthusiastic support for Vladimir Putin.
NEWS: ""The strikes on Ukraine's infrastructure have shown that Russia can destroy this state in a short period of time,"" writes the American political analyst, former collaborator of the White House during the Ronald Administration, in an article on his website on November 25 Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts. He claims that Russia shows restraint towards Ukraine because of the historical unity of the two states.
It seems that the Russians do not want to destroy everything... Russia could turn Ukraine into ruins in a single day without the use of nuclear weapons. The Kremlin's restraint has a number of explanations. Ukraine and its population have been part of Russia for centuries. There are many mixed marriages. The majority of Ukrainians do not support the neo-Nazis who have ruled Ukraine since 2014, when the US organized a coup d'état in Kiev... The Kremlin does not want to have a poor and ruined state near its borders and then be responsible for rebuilding the Ukrainian infrastructure "".
NARRATIVE: Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russia has launched an intense bombing campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure targets since October.
On October 10, Russia launched 84 missiles and 24 drones at Ukraine, with a total average value of 700 million dollars, according to Forbes. More than half of the missiles were shot down by the anti-aircraft defense system, according to Kiev. On November 15, Russian forces fired about 100 missiles at Ukraine, hitting several essential energy infrastructures in different regions, several Ukrainian cities were left without electricity. It was the most massive missile attack in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The initial pretext for the attacks was that Moscow was responding to the explosion that damaged the bridge over the Kerch Strait, although the nature of the first bombing clearly shows that it had been prepared in advance, a few days before the explosion on the bridge. Later, Moscow claimed that it was bombing the civilian infrastructure to reduce the capacity of the Ukrainian army, then the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, explicitly said that Ukraine can ""end"" the suffering of the population (and the bombing of the infrastructure) if it accepts Moscow's demands; finally, the Russian ambassador to the UN claimed that, in fact, the infrastructure was not damaged by Russian missiles but by Ukrainian anti-aircraft.
Moreover, Russia did not show restraint from the beginning of the war, but it kept trying to convince its citizens that it was saving Russian-speakers in Ukraine from Nazism and that it had launched the ""special military operation"" to protect the peaceful Ukrainian population. In fact, it still since the beginning of the war, civilians have repeatedly been the target of Russian attacks, notable cases include the bombing of the theater in Mariupol, the railway station in Kramatorsk, the convoy near Zaporozhye, the killing of civilians in Kiev, Lvov and other cities. add the numerous Russian attacks on residential areas, educational and medical institutions, the thousands of war crimes. Several mass graves, torture centers, citizen filtering centers were discovered, which indicate the existence of a Moscow-level strategy of intentional destruction of civilian targets to achieve military-political goals.
In the article published on Ukraina.ru, an American political analyst is quoted who illustrates the propaganda theses of the Kremlin. In fact, Paul Craig Roberts is not an independent political scientist, but an ardent supporter of Russia who, in addition, has been accused of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial, as well as promoting numerous conspiracy theories, including about the attacks by on September 11 or the assassination of American President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. In 2016, according to Russian media, Roberts applied for Russian citizenship.
In the years 2014-2022, he is the most cited American political analyst by the Russian press, promoting the Kremlin's official narratives: the US organized a coup d'état in Ukraine, neo-Nazis are in power in Kiev, Ukrainians are part of the Russian people, the press the American one misinforms the public opinion, and the Russian one tells the truth. Like other influential agents of Russia in the Western countries, Paul Craig Roberts confirms all the propaganda theses of the Russian media.
Roberts also took up the topic of Ukrainian neo-Nazism, about which Veridica recently wrote, dismantling another similar false narrative, amplified by the Polish political scientist Konrad Rekas. In reality, the Ukrainian authorities cannot be compared to a Nazi regime, and Russia's war is one of invading a territory, an unprovoked act of aggression condemned by the international community.
In July 2015, Ukraine prohibited by law any public manifestation of communist and Nazi ideology, so the statement that this state must be ""denazified"" is meaningless. In addition, the Ukrainian military participated in the Soviet army's victory over Nazism. Nazism and communism are prohibited on the territory of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media, according to which the inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region are waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince the Russian society without any evidence that the nationalist leader Stepan Bandera was canonized in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

In reality, the Dutch court recognized Russia's involvement in this crime against civilians.
NEWS: ""The Hague Tribunal did not directly link the use of the Buk anti-aircraft defense system against flight MH17 with Russia in the investigation into the 2014 Malaysian Boeing crash in eastern Ukraine, following the catastrophe that killed 298 people , reports RIA Novosti, referring to the announcement of the verdict in the courtroom.
Previously, the court found guilty the Russians Igor (Strelkov) Girkin, Serghei Dubinski and the Ukrainian Leonid Harcenko for shooting down the plane and killing 298 passengers. [...] The Dutch court decided that the culprits will have to pay the families of the victims a total of 16 million euros.
The press agency mentioned that during the hearing, the president-judge Hendrik Steenhuis spoke exclusively about the responsibility of the four defendants, without touching on the subject of Russia's involvement in this incident, although the court's opinion was expressed that Russia then had control over the Donetsk People's Republic "" NARRATIVE: The Hague Court recognized that Russia was not involved in the downing of the MH17 plane in 2014.
CONTEXT: The Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down on July 17, 2014 in the territory controlled by the separatists in the Donetsk region. All 298 people on board were killed. Most were citizens of the Netherlands. A joint international investigation, with representatives of the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, concluded in 2021 that the plane was shot down by a Russian-made Buk missile belonging to the 53rd Air Defense Brigade of the armed forces Russian from Kursk, near the border with Ukraine.
Since 2014, Russia has launched a series of false narratives about the downing of this plane. According to one version, the plane was shot by the Ukrainian army, assuming that President Vladimir Putin was on board. In Moscow, they stated that the missile is part of the 9M38 production series with which a military unit from the Ukrainian region of Ternopil was equipped. Moscow's representatives accused Ukraine of being involved in the downing of the plane and of falsifying the evidence.
OBJECTIVE: Manipulating public opinion and hiding the truth in Russian society about Moscow's involvement in the downing of the Malaysian plane.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, if we carefully read the Hague Court's verdict, published in English and Russian, we notice that the investigation presented a series of evidence regarding Russia's involvement in the downing of the aircraft. The actual text of the court decision dismantles the disinformation narrative launched by the Kremlin in most government media institutions. The president of the court, judge Hendrik Steenhuis, mentioned during the verdict that the Russian Federation had overall control over the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), which means that Moscow was responsible for that territory at the time of the downing of the plane.
It was mentioned that many separatist leaders had Russian citizenship or extensive experience in the army of the Russian Federation. ""Some DNR leaders had close ties with the Russian Federation. For example, the intercepted conversations often mention contacts with high dignitaries from the Russian Federation,"" said the judge. Hendrik Steenhuis also mentioned Russia's regular sending of weapons to the DNR and the training of the rebels. Moscow is also accused of naming the heads of the self-proclaimed bodies leadership of the DNR, coordinating the military activities directed against Ukraine.
One of these Russian-appointed leaders was Igor Girkin, a former colonel in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), who at the time of the downing of the plane was Minister of Defense and commander of the armed forces of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk.
According to the verdict, the ""Buk"" missile, which was of Russian manufacture, was brought from Russia to the Donetsk region, and after the air disaster - the installation was transported back to hide the evidence. In other words, the court's verdict shows the direct involvement of Russia in shooting down the plane Based on the preliminary investigation, in March 2022 Australia and the Netherlands officially accused Russia of shooting down the plane, their position being supported by the EU.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the downing of this plane, launched by the Russian government media in recent years. In July 2021, a false Kremlin narrative was launched, according to which Ukraine's fault for the downing of flight MH-17 continues to be hidden from the West. In August 2021, the Russian press indirectly accused Ukraine of shooting down the plane, mentioning that the Taliban are much more concerned with flight security than Ukraine. Publication / Media:

According to him, the business would also suit Romania, which will be able to control the mouths of the Danube. Soon this will become the most urgent problem in the region, according to the politician""
NARRATIVE: The Republic of Moldova is ready to violate its status of neutrality and get involved in the war on the side of Ukraine, exchanging territories to give it access to a military depot
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Transnistria was attached to the former Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic during the USSR, in exchange regions from the south and north were handed over to Ukraine. With the disintegration of the USSR, Transnistria declared its independence, and in 1992 an armed conflict was reached. On the territory of the separatist enclave, supported by Moscow, there is also a military warehouse with approximately 20,000 tons of ammunition, guarded by a Russian military contingent. Its presence is considered one of the main impediments to the settlement of the frozen conflict in the region.
The Russian military presence in western Ukraine and the existence of a pro-Russian regime in the separatist region returned to the attention of the international community with the start of the war in Ukraine, and since then the idea of ​​a possible exchange of territories began to be promoted more intensively, a possibility that is not discussed official from Chisinau and Kiev. Also, some voices from Bucharest allude to territorial claims that Romania, as well as other states, could present to Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: To resume the accusations promoted by the propaganda from Moscow that the pro-European authorities from Chisinau are involved or are ready to be involved in the war in Ukraine on the side of Kiev. To bring back into discussion the subject of a possible exchange of territories between the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, in order to cause uncertainty and phobias among the population. Indirectly, to bring back into discussion the theses promoted by Moscow that Ukraine is not a national state.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: In 1992, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine signed the bilateral treaty in which they recognize each other's borders. However, the subject of a transfer of territories appears regularly in the Russian press or from Chisinau, apparently to incite the spirits, since there is no intention of Chisinau and Kiev regarding a possible exchange of territories.
Chisinau opts for the peaceful settlement of the Transnistrian conflict and considers the region part of the Republic of Moldova, as provided for in the Constitution, and the possibility of exchanging territories has never been discussed at the official level.
On the other hand, a former Minister of Defense from Chisinau, Vitalie Marinuta, told NG that the ammunition from Cobasna is out of use, but his statements are not taken into account by sm.news and eadaily.com.
The subject seems to be promoted by the Russian press and to refuel another thesis promoted by Moscow regarding the fact that Ukraine is not a national state and its neighbors would have the right to parts of its territory. This thesis is also used to reduce the sympathy and support of the international community for Ukraine in the context of its war of defense against Russia. Publication / Media:

She argues her thesis by citing a single far-right politician.
NEWS: ""In recent months, the standard of living in France has dropped critically, and the assistance given to Ukraine at the expense of the country causes dissatisfaction among the French. This opinion was expressed by a French politician, the leader of the Popular Republican Union party, Francois Asselineau, quoted by RIA Novosti.
On his Twitter account, he asked a simple, but very widespread question, if the sanctions against Russia are worth continuing?
It should be noted that the French regularly criticize the authorities for the policy of sanctions. The president is also criticized. The French are sure that the leader must take into account first of all the interests of the citizens of his country"".
NARRATIVE: The French reject the policy of sanctions against Russia and the assistance granted to Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media built this propaganda narrative based on a classic method of generalizing the opinion of a pro-Kremlin politician to all citizens of a state. Francois Asselineau is quoted, who is a far-right politician, a supporter of the Putin regime, but also a follower of France's exit from the EU and NATO.
The Republican People's Union Party has never had members in parliament or local councils, and Francois Asselineau was voted in the 2017 presidential elections by only 0.92% of voters. After this failure, he did not participate in the presidential elections of 2022. His point of view and that of his party is not representative of French society. This politician distributed various false narratives of the Kremlin on his Twitter account, writing, for example, in October that Zelensky is the author of a genocide against Russian speakers and criticizing Macron for supporting ""a Nazi regime"".
Starting from these opinions of Asselineau, close to the pro-Kremlin narratives, the Russian press wrote that all the French criticize the authorities and do not understand why the anti-Russian sanctions are continued and why Ukraine enjoys support. In reality, one of the electoral messages of President Emmanuel Macron, re-elected this year, was the support of Ukraine and the non-allowance of the expansion of the war launched by Russia. Also, according to a survey published at the end of September, 62% of the French support the policy of sanctions against Russia in the context of the war in Ukraine.
The thesis that governments should do more for their citizens than for Ukrainians is not new; In fact, Veridica identified her in the first days of the war in an online campaign against Ukrainian refugees that took place in the Republic of Moldova.
Veridica also dismantled a series of false narratives that aimed to manipulate public opinion and present positions critical of Russia as supporting and solidarity with it. In July, Russian propaganda ""proves"" that American scientists support Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. In October, the Russian press wrote that foreign diplomats are withdrawing from Kiev for fear of a Russian offensive. Various fake news about the Government in Kiev were also launched , who expressed his distrust in the partners from the West, or about the terrorists trained in the EU, who will act against civilians in Donbass.

In reality, units of the partner armies are constantly invited to the parade, not only from NATO, but even from the ex-Soviet space.
NEWS: ""The military parade on Romania's National Day will no longer be Romania's. MApN decided to invite 600 foreign soldiers from NATO, to march in place of the Romanian Army. The representatives of the reserve officers say that it is a mockery of the citizens and that this means that Romania no longer has an army, being also a clear signal that the territory of our country has been made available to NATO.""
NARRATIVE: Left without resources, capital, labor and independent justice, Romania lost the last bastion of sovereignty, the army.
CONTEXT: Since the days preceding the Russian invasion in Ukraine, several disinformations regarding the Romanian army (it is preparing for war, mobilizing its reservists), as well as false narratives related to the defensive capabilities of the Romanian state (it has a weak army) have been released into the public space , equipped with outdated equipment, etc.). Their intensification is, in fact, meant to discredit NATO and undermine confidence in it. Most of them were dismantled, in an interview for Veridica, by the head of the Directorate of Information and Public Relations of the MApN, Brigadier General Constantin Spinu. The information under discussion now is no exception, being just another piece in the disinformation puzzle originating in Moscow.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting sovereignist and anti-Western discourse, undermining trust in NATO.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The December 1st military parade is a constant in the events that Romania celebrates its National Day, with the exception of 2020, when, due to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, it was cancelled. With the accession to NATO and the signing of other treaties and bilateral military partnerships, along with the Romanian armed forces, foreign soldiers also participate in the parade, in an approach based on reciprocity. It is obvious, however, that the number of soldiers participating in the parades of other countries is lower than that of the foreign soldiers who parade in Romania, because we are talking about the comparison between the forces generated by several states and the forces of a single country. The fact that ""we no longer have troops"" is obviously false information, currently the Romanian army numbers approximately 75,000 active soldiers, to which is added a number of approximately 55,000 paramilitaries (mainly gendarmes), and the military forces in reserve are estimated to 50,000 people. The statement ""[...] Americans, French, Poles and those who are still in the country, that there are more than us"" is equally absurd, the number of foreign soldiers present on the territory of Romania being no greater than 5,000 people, and this in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. Before February 24, there were approximately 3,300 foreign soldiers in Romania. Poland, one of the states preferred as an example of independence by nationalist propaganda, hosted 10,500 foreign soldiers, but this fact did not seem to destroy Polish sovereignty at all in the eyes of Romanian patriots. Last but not least, the Government Decision referred to in the article under discussion approves the invitation of a maximum of 600 people who will be part of the military detachments of NATO member states and partners. It is quite clear, we appreciate, that the imposition of a limit does not imply reaching it. And, since we are still talking about hundreds of people, we have as an example the parade from 2019, in which 500 soldiers from 21 allied or partner states participated. It is true, however, that at that time, not faced with either the pandemic or the war, the nationalist propaganda had somewhat lost its momentum: in the absence of Russian aggression, three years ago there was no question that ""we became a visible target for the Russians"" and neither that the parade some NATO soldiers in Romania would represent a challenge for Moscow.
Regarding the status of ""territory occupied"" by NATO forces, here we are dealing with a thesis promoted intensively by Russian and pro-Russian propaganda and it is a direct continuation of the Cold War theses regarding the usurping and exploiting West. Romania is the one that requested to be accepted in NATO and made the commitment that, as a member, to accept and adopt the common rules for all member states. Although the military and political strength of Romania is not as great as that of the majority of member states (which can translate into less influence at the NATO level) it is, legally, a member that has exactly the same rights and obligations as the others. It can be argued that, once it enters NATO, all countries have ceded part of their territory to the NATO armies, but this is a voluntary act and not the consequence of a territorial invasion.

In reality, both the Ukrainian army and the leaders from Kiev were greeted as liberators, and with the departure of the Russians, information regarding war crimes committed by them began to appear.
NEWS: ""The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, visited the city of Kherson. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are preparing to execute by shooting the civilians in the city. [...] This became possible after the Russian troops regrouped on the left bank of the Dnieper.
Ukraine will start actions to clean up civilians in Kherson, said the deputy governor of the Kherson region, Ekaterina Gubariova. She mentioned that the inhabitants of the city of Kherson should not visit the center because of this danger. Previously, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Maria Zaharova, stated that there will be executions and massacres of civilians"".
NARRATIVE: Volodymyr Zelensky visited Kherson to launch the massacre of civilians.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Kherson on November 14, after this city was liberated by the Ukrainian army following the withdrawal of Russian troops on the left bank of the Dnieper.
Zelenskiy posted on his Telegram channel various information about the situation in Kherson, mentioning the progress made for the supply of electricity, the restoration of Ukrainian mobile telephony, the provision of medical assistance. From the neighboring region, Mikolaev, 25 tons of food products, 3 tons of hygiene products and an ambulance were brought to Kherson. The President of Ukraine thanked the Ukrainian military for having managed to bring normalcy to this city in the south of Ukraine. In liberated Kherson there was no water, no electricity, no internet. Social networks were flooded with images about how the Ukrainian army was received by the citizens. Information also appeared about how Russian forces behaved with civilians, and the international press wrote how Russian soldiers could enter homes at any time, stealing, kidnapping or torturing.
In Kherson, pits with corpses of civilians were discovered, as well as real torture centers, used by the occupying army to destroy the resistance of the inhabitants, who protested against the occupation from the very beginning. Therefore, the Ukrainian army did not come to execute the population, as Russian propaganda says, but to save it from Russia's war crimes.
Ekaterina Gubariova, presented by the Russian press as a deputy governor of the Kherson region, does not represent the legitimate Ukrainian authorities, but an occupation body created by the Kremlin and legitimized in the internal Russian legislation by the act of annexation, signed by Vladimir Putin on September 30.
Gubariova would have forbidden the inhabitants of Kherson to visit the city center in order not to be executed by firing squad, a fact confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
In reality, Ekaterina Gubariova has no control over the city, and her message is addressed especially to the domestic Russian public to demonstrate that there is a certain communication between the occupation authorities, called legitimate, and the residents.
Veridica showed, in a dialogue with a Ukrainian military man of Romanian origin, that the Kiev troops are seen by civilians as liberating forces, and in the localities where the Russian troops were driven out, life is returning to normal, the changes being felt over the course of several weeks.
Also, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the pro-Kremlin media, which aimed to demonstrate that Ukraine is massacring Russian speakers in the east and south of Ukraine. The Russian press wrote in June that the Ukrainian army is massacring Russian-speakers in Donbass, after in May, according to false narratives launched by Moscow, Kiev developed a plan to organize a genocide of civilians in Kharkiv. Russian propaganda kept trying to prove to public opinion that the news about the massacres committed by the Russian military are not true. In April, the Russian press wrote that the Ukrainian army is bringing corpses to Lisiansk to stage a new massacre, after reporting that the murders in Izium or Bucea were fabrications.

The false narrative is picked up by Politnavigator, a website affiliated with the Kremlin.
NEWS: ""Deploying their troops in Romania, the Americans are thinking first of all about an attack on Transnistria, whose supply lines have been cut, said political scientist Marat Basirov in an interview with the channel ""Vashi Novosti""
""This scenario aims to occupy Transnistria. We have armed forces there, but there are several thousand and they do not have access to the supply routes"".

""The only power plant in Transnistria supplies energy to this republic (Transnistria) and Moldova. That is, they bring the army to Romania intending to solve the transport, energy and military problems. If we had conquered Odessa, everything would have been simple""
NARRATIVE: The United States is preparing an attack on Russian/pro-Russian forces in Transnistria.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Narratives regarding the danger posed by NATO, the most important defensive military organization, for the Russian Federation have been among the most frequently invoked by Russian propaganda lately. This is also one of the reasons why Russia claims to have attacked Ukraine.
In recent months, Russian propaganda, but also politicians and the pro-Russian press from Chisinau have launched several falsehoods about the Republic of Moldova's approach to NATO, the massing of Romanian military troops in the Republic of Moldova or plans to attack Transnistria by the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and /or NATO/Romania.
The new narrative, in which the main target becomes the Cuciurgan Power Plant, is launched in the context in which this structure, controlled by a Russian company and the Transnistrian separatist authorities, stopped the supply of electricity to the Republic of Moldova (right bank) after Gazprom reduced the volume of natural gas.
OBJECTIVE: To further fuel the idea of ​​the danger that NATO presents to Russia/the Russian world and thus to justify the war launched by the Kremlin against Ukraine.
 
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Marat Basirov, the one who promotes theses about NATO preparations to attack Transnistria, is the political scientist who in February talked about a war that should have started in 2023-2024. It refers to the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army, recently located in Romania. Its purpose is to fortify NATO's eastern flank in the context of Russia's war in Ukraine and it has no war missions.
NATO leaders have repeatedly declared that they are ready to defend the member states, including Romania, in case of attacks from Russia, but they have specified that they do not intend to attack Russia directly.
Also, the authorities from Chisinau have repeatedly stated that they do not intend to attack the separatist region in the east of the country and continue to opt for the identification of a peaceful solution, even if officials from Kiev have stated several times that the Ukrainian army could eliminate very easily the military and paramilitary structures on the left side of the Dniester.
The thesis related to the attack on the Cuciurgan Power Plant seems even less likely given that its destruction would also leave the right bank of the Dniester without energy. Even if it no longer supplies electricity, the energy that the Republic of Moldova imports from Romania still passes through the respective plant
TRUTH: Elements of the US Army's 101st Airborne Division, nicknamed ""The Screaming Eagles"", were sent to Romania to support NATO's eastern flank. Publication / Media:

In reality, in the register of draft laws that will be examined or that have been adopted, we do not find such an initiative.
Moreover, the words of President Volodymyr Zelensky, which illustrate the news, are not taken out of context, as Russian propaganda often does, but are simply invented. At no bilateral meeting with representatives of the Polish state did the president of Ukraine speak about any union or association.
At the same time, on September 16, a law came into force that offers Polish citizens in Ukraine additional social, legal and economic guarantees. As a sign of gratitude for supporting Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees during the war, Kiev decided that Polish citizens can engage in work and stay on the territory of Ukraine for 18 months. The law says nothing about territorial changes, the association of some Ukrainian regions with Poland, etc. The false narrative about the annexation of the Lviv region to Warsaw appeared 2 weeks after the entry into force of this law, adopted by the Kyiv Parliament in July.
Also, Poland amended its legislation in March to offer as many opportunities as possible to Ukrainian refugees to integrate into the social and economic structure of Polish society.
The propaganda narrative was launched after the Russian state media published the news about the organization of a referendum on joining Poland in the Lviv region, fabricating information about the ballots stamped by the Polish authorities and Zelenski's promise to allow the annexation.
Poland became a target of Russian propaganda because it was the most vocal of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. Warsaw's actions are determined not least by the fear that Poland will be the next target of Russian aggression. According to a sociological survey, 74% of Poles believe that Russia could attack Poland in the near future.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding Poland's ""desire"" to annex Ukrainian territories. In addition to the false information about the referendum in Lviv, the Russian media also wrote that Warsaw will start a war against Moscow in the next 10 years , while the majority of Poles support the invasion of the western regions of Ukraine. Poland has been accused of wanting to take over its ""historical territories"" from Ukraine, using the weakening of the Ukrainian state. According to Russian propaganda, the President of Poland admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories, and Kiev would have allowed 10 thousand soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country.

In reality, there is no such government order, both producers have ongoing contracts, which must be honored.
NEWS: ""The population and the economic environment in Romania were sacrificed for the sake of Maia Sandu. Hidroelectrica and Nuclearelectrica no longer sell energy in the market, not even for next year, they received orders from the Government to reserve the entire amount for the Republic of Moldova. In this context, President Maia Sandu urged the Romanians to save energy so that it reaches the Republic of Moldova. Someone said that, for how many billions of lei the Republic of Moldova received from us, not even a thank you was heard from the officials across the Prut. Moreover, President Maia Sandu came to Romania not to thank for the help, but to ask for more energy and, above all, to ask us to save energy, so that we can give it to the Moldovans. It's just our obligation. It is certain that the visit achieved its goal. And now the energy suddenly disappeared from the market, and the state companies were ordered to reserve it for the neighboring country.""
NARRATIVE: The Romanians will not have electricity in the winter because of the Moldovans.
CONTEXT: The Republic of Moldova, a country without its own energy resources, is completely dependent on imports of fossil fuels and electricity. Before the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the Moldovan state buys its electricity from Ukraine (about 30% of what is needed) and the rest from the Cuciurgan power plant, located on the left bank of the Dniester, on the territory of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria. In October, the Russian bombings mainly targeted the Ukrainian energy infrastructure and, for this reason, Ukraine's exports to the European Union and Moldova were stopped. That is why the Chisinau government had to buy the entire amount of electricity needed from the Transnistrian plant, which is under the exclusive control of Russia. The separatist leaders from Tiraspol, encouraged by the Kremlin, took full advantage of this situation and, from November 1, stopped electricity deliveries to the right bank of the Dniester, blackmailing Moldova to receive more gas. The bailout comes under the conditions that the Transnistrian region has not paid for the gas consumed in the last 31 years, accumulating a debt of over 8 billion dollars. In this context, the reaction of our country was a prompt one, and the Moldovan electricity needs are provided, at this moment, in a proportion of 90%, by Romanian companies. At the same time, the Bucharest government also approved aid for the supply of fuel oil and firewood. At the same time, through diplomatic channels, Romanian officials are appealing to the international community to grant grants to the Republic of Moldova so that it can buy energy on the free market.
OBJECTIVE: Weakening Romanians' trust in the authorities, inducing the feeling of fear that they will freeze in their houses in winter, enmity between the two Romanian countries on the banks of the Prut.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The article appeared on a well-known website promoting fake news (many similar to those promoted by Moscow) does not provide even an official source or a document attesting that the Romanian government ordered that the production of Hydroelectric and Nuclear to be reserved exclusively for Moldova. At this moment, Moldova buys electricity from Romania, from OMV Petrom and Nuclearelectrica. There are contacts for signing a contract with yet another Romanian producer, but this does not imply exclusivity conditions at all, the producers being involved, obviously, in other contracts already signed and in progress. There is, indeed, an article in Ordinance 138/2022, which obliges all electricity producers in Romania to sell energy to suppliers and traders from the Republic of Moldova at a capped price, but it does not refer to certain producers nor does it oblige them for them to reserve the entire production for export across the Prut, but only ""within the limit of the available quantities"". Moreover, the respective article invokes exceptional situations caused by the war in Ukraine and refers exclusively to the needs of Moldovan final consumers. In support of the presented ideas, the material in the discussion, he also invokes a statement by the executive director of the Romanian Energy Suppliers Association, Ion Lungu, who states that the suppliers are complaining that they no longer have anywhere to buy energy and that, on the wholesale market, no more transactions are made. in fact, the statement of the director of AFEER says the same things that the president of AFEER, Laurentiu Urluescu, said on October 14, so more than two weeks before the outbreak of the crisis in Moldova. The statements invoke the very bad legislation (n.r. - in the opinion of AFEER members) that currently regulates the energy market in Romania, unrelated to the situation in Moldova. Probably unnoticed by the author of the article on national.ro, there is even in Ion Lungu's statement a remark that confirms the fact that there is absolutely no government provision related to the exclusive reservation of electricity production for the Moldovan state: ""And then the producers, which are state companies, wait, lest they be forced by the Government to give to the Republic of Moldova and have nowhere to turn.""
On a different note, speculating on a personal note, we cannot help but notice the enormous chance that has now appeared for Moldova to get rid of its energy dependence on Russia and the Kremlin's political blackmail, together with the rest of Europe. Romanian-Moldovan diplomatic efforts are starting to give more than encouraging results. Already, Prime Minister Ciuca declared that Romania can give the Republic of Moldova 5 million cubic meters of gas per day, more than enough for the consumption across the Prut, including during the winter, but at the moment no official act has been signed in this sense. The United States will provide financial aid to the Chisinau authorities for connecting the key elements of the Moldovan energy sector to the European systems, as well as for attracting investments in local production. And the President of the European Commission, Ursula von de Leyen, announced that the European Union will help Moldova ""to face its immediate needs for gas and electricity"". Also, there is already a project financed by the United Nations Development Program , intended, among other things, to create and strengthen effective mechanisms for addressing and preventing the risks caused by the recent energy crisis and other potentially future ones. The divorce of Moldovans from Russia will not be easy, but it has begun. The first step is to get through this winter with good, together. Publication / Media:

In total, according to some sources, Moldovagaz could have hidden approximately 140 million cubic meters of gas. From November 1, after the amount of gas delivered to Transnistria was reduced, these volumes could have increased. Part of the stolen gas is stored in warehouses on the territory of Ukraine, as well as in the Iasi-Chisinau gas pipeline.
There is an assumption that Moldovagaz sells gas to Ukraine at the market price, violating the provisions of the Moldovan-Russian contract that prohibits re-export to third countries""
NARRATIVE: The Republic of Moldova steals natural gas destined for Transnistria and sells it to Ukraine, violating the contract with Gazprom and endangering the lives of the residents (including Russians) of the separatist region.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is facing a complex energy crisis, deepened with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Being dependent on imported energy resources and having citizens with the lowest purchasing power in Europe, the increase in prices for this category of products affected the Republic of Moldova both economically and socially. Since the beginning of the year, gasoline has become more expensive by approximately 30%, and diesel by 60%, while the tariffs for gas and electricity have increased several times.
Starting this autumn, in addition to high prices, the Republic of Moldova is also facing a gas and electricity deficit. From October 1st, Gazprom started to deliver only 70% of the gas volume stipulated in the contract, and from November it covers only about half. Since October 11, Ukraine has stopped exporting electricity. Until then, the Republic of Moldova imported approximately 30% of consumption from this market. From November 1, the Cuciurgan Power Plant, located in the separatist region on the left side of the Dniester, but which belongs to a Russian company, suspended electricity deliveries to the right of the Dniester. The plant covered 70% of the energy requirement.
Most of the electricity needed is currently provided by Romania, but the price has increased, so that since November the rates have been increased again.
After the separatist authorities in Transnistria stopped the supply of electricity, the Republic of Moldova reduced the volume of gas for the left bank of the Dniester, and Tiraspol complained to Moscow.
At the end of October, the representatives of Chisinau and Tiraspol had a round of discussions focused on the energy issue, but without much results, as the Deputy Prime Minister for Reintegration, Oleg Serebrian, later commented.
OBJECTIVE: To inoculate the idea that the government in Chisinau makes money at the expense of Russian citizens from Transnistria, violating the provisions of the contract with Gazprom.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: Even if Moldovagaz has reduced the volume of gas for the left bank of the Dniester, the remaining amount covers only 80% of what is needed, so that Chisinau was forced to procure over 150 million cubic meters of gas, which he stored them in Romania and Ukraine. It is logical, as an official from the Ministry of Infrastructure and Regional Development told Radio Moldova, that the Republic of Moldova does not sell, since it has to buy.
Also, the director of Moldovagaz, Vadim Ceban, stated that on the one hand the company does not have the right to sell gas on the foreign market, and on the other hand the quantities of gas that the Republic of Moldova stores in Ukraine cannot be used by it for the needs its. ""Moldovagaz, first of all, cannot sell to anyone outside the domestic market, according to the contract with Gazprom. The gases that are now stored in Ukraine, in the underground warehouses, are the property of Energocom and will be able to be used in case of emergency, but all operators are governed by European rules, which prohibit the use of gas quantities for their own purposes"", explained Vadim Ceban .

""All the unemployed in Ukraine will be sent to the front"", writes the former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mikola Azarov from the time of the pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in a post on Twitter, quoted by the pro-Kremlin press and Telegram channels in Russia.
NARRATIVE: The unemployed from Ukraine will be enlisted in the army and sent to the front
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Starting from a post on Twitter by the ex-pro-Russian Prime Minister of Ukraine Mikola Azarov, who fled to Russia after the outbreak of the military conflict in Donbass and the annexation of Crimea in 2014, pro-Kremlin media and Telegram channels from Russia distributed a false narrative about sending unemployed Ukrainians to the front.
If Azarov tries to convince the public opinion that the unemployed will be sent to the front by the Ukrainian Government, the press writes that ""for now"" they will be enlisted in the ""Recovery Army"", implying that they will be sent to the conflict zone later.
The propaganda narrative exploits to the maximum the name of the Ukrainian government project ""Recovery Army"", which is not a military unit. The Ukrainian Minister of Economy, Yulia Sviridenko, even emphasized that it is a non-military structure: ""At the moment we have two armies in the country - the first defends the country on the front, and the other - works"". The Ukrainian governor emphasized that no one will be forced to participate in this project, and those who will work will benefit from remuneration at the level of the minimum wage in the economy.
Taking into account the manipulations launched by the pro-Kremlin media on this topic, most of the Regional Military Administrations in Ukraine have published on their official pages explanations regarding the functioning of this governmental project. Therefore, the Ternopil Regional Administration writes that in Sumi people will take care of cleaning the riverbeds and repairs in various buildings, and in Chernihiv - the redevelopment of landfills and the repair of social spaces. These regions are far from the front area, and the works described are not military activities. According to the Government's explanations, participation in the ""Recovery Army"" is not mandatory, and by Article 43 of the Constitution of Ukraine, forced labor is prohibited even under the conditions of marital law.

NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian army gives money to those who trick their friends into enlisting.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there were no such ""offers"" or ""promotional contests"" at the level of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Russian press, Telegram and Twitter channels cite the official pages of the Ukrainian army, but without including hyperlinks. There is no such announcement, presented in the form of a video clip by Russian propaganda, on any official page of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Armed Forces or relevant departments. Therefore, the information about the monetary prizes offered to people who bring their friends to the military commissariat is an invention of the Russian press, because the announcement cannot be found on the official pages of the Ministry of Defense or the Ukrainian army, and the Russian press does not present any evidence. Once again, false citation is used as a method of creating propaganda messages, to which the Russian government press increasingly resorts in the last months of the war.
The process of military recruitment or mobilization during martial law is described in small details by Ukrainian legislation, and the offering of monetary prizes or any other relations of this kind between the military commissariat and citizens are illegal. There is no legal mechanism for offering prizes or remuneration in the context of the general mobilization determined by the war. Art. 15 of the 1993 Mobilization Law describes the mobilization process. During the period of mobilization, the enlisted person keeps his job and salary until mobilization. Those who need to be mobilized, especially men between the ages of 18 and 60, and refuse to do so will be penalized and judged, according to the law.
The Center for Countering Disinformation, which operates alongside the Government of Ukraine, wrote on its Telegram channel that Russia, through various propaganda messages, discredits the mobilization campaign in Ukraine, as it is a wider informational-psychological operation, the purpose of which is to discourage Ukrainian resistance in this war.
In addition, it is Russia that has been intensely criticized for the methods used to restore its forces decimated by the war - from the recruitment of prisoners among the Wagner mercenaries, to the forced mobilization, ""with the arcanum"", of thousands of people.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the mobilization process in Ukraine. In May, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine is mobilizing a million soldiers, paying with human beings for Western loans. Other propaganda narratives followed, according to which the EU will deport refugee men to Ukraine to be conscripted into the Ukrainian army, while volunteers enroll in pro-Russian battalions that will defend the country's southeastern regions from the Ukrainian army.

So it does that for about two weeks. When we enter Schengen , the entrance gate to Schengen is the port of Constanta. And then it is much simpler for the one from Frankfurt to send the goods to Constanta, which at some point goes to the Black Sea from this point of view. And then, it is a trick to the Dutch lobby, as we also have internally, the Dutch have a lobby, parenthesis: few people remember that before '89 the nest of Western spies was the ambassador of the Netherlands; we had been surrounded from an informational point of view, he went over everything; and it was for a long time after '90. This is one of the causes, Schengen no longer means customs."" (Ion Cristoiu, at the Marius Tuca show, from 23:50)
NARRATIVE: The Netherlands will not accept Romania in the Schengen area, because the port of Constanta will compete with the Dutch port of Rotterdam.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: Romania and Bulgaria should have been admitted to the Schengen area in March 2011, according to an agreement at the level of the European Union. However, the entry was postponed, the reasons cited by the opposing states being corruption and the lack of real justice reforms in the two countries. Mainly, Germany, Finland and Austria were the most vehement, but France and the Netherlands also showed some reluctance. Surprisingly, in the fall of 2011, the Netherlands accentuated its opposition, invoking, together with Finland, the danger of illegal immigration from Turkey through Bulgaria and Romania into the community space. Bucharest's diplomatic attempts to solve the problem did not have the expected success, and the position of the Netherlands remained unchanged.
Immediately, associating the information with the 2012 parliamentary elections, Vocea Rusiei launched in the Romanian media the theory of Dutch interests regarding the port of Constanta and their connection with the refusal to accept our country in Schengen. It was quickly taken over and disseminated by various politicians and maritime transport experts. It is enough to say that Vocea Rusiei is the former name of the Sputnik agency, Russia's main propaganda tool and fake news launcher, so that we have a clear picture of the veracity of the arguments that make up this theory. Since then, it reappears sporadically in the news streams, whenever the sovereignist propaganda runs out of current topics.
In the context of the war in Ukraine and amplified by the increase in European solidarity against the backdrop of the resulting crisis, Romania's chances of joining Schengen have increased considerably. The leaders of Germany and France, as well as the institutions in Brussels, explicitly support this, the only still hesitating opinion being that of the Netherlands. As a result, the Rotterdam-Constanta topic was brought back into the public space by Ion Cristoiu in a series of statements made in the online broadcasts of some journalists at least as controversial as him.
OBJECTIVE: Weakening public opinion's trust in the European Union, undermining European solidarity, inducing the idea that the West considers us to be inferior citizens and that for equal rights we will have to give up sovereignty and economic independence.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: An objective analysis to show the possible advantages of one of the ports over the other must take into account not only the geographical position, but also aspects of the port infrastructure, the land network of access roads and, not in lastly, the socio-economic and political situation of the analyzed areas. Currently, Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe, the amount of goods passing through the Dutch port being greater than the combined amounts of the next two, Antwerp and Hamburg. The Port of Constanta is rather an isolated port, any maritime transport in connection with it having to pass through two straits, which implies higher costs and delivery times, as well as some size limitations. It is becoming more and more irrelevant in trade relations with Asia and especially China for two reasons:

The new Silk Road is becoming a reality every day that excludes a maritime route through the Black Sea. For several years, a freight train has been running directly between the east coast of China and London, passing through Rotterdam and Hamburg as well. Moreover, the land transport infrastructure (railways and highways) in Central and Western Europe is much more developed than in Romania, where transport from Constanta Port to the west represents an eternal problem. However, we must mention that, in the current context, crossing the Russian-Ukrainian war zone by land can become problematic.
Although not without controversy, the acquisition by the Chinese of the port of Piraeus brought a new regional hub to the forefront of commercial routes. Compared to the investments and profits registered by the Chinese in Greece, it is expected that their interest will not increase at all in the sense of relocating some of the operations to the Black Sea. Much closer to the exit to the Mediterranean of the Asian commercial route, Piraeus has real chances to become perhaps the most important Mediterranean port, a fact that will lead to the diminishing and thus decreasing role of the port of Constanta.

In addition to the geographical disadvantage, Constanta also faces technological, bureaucratic or financial problems. The port of Rotterdam is fully automated, being from this point of view the most technologically advanced port in the world. In contrast to this, the technological level of the port of Constanta not only stagnates, but seems to decrease with the passage of time. The lack of equipment is felt to the full when it comes to activities related to the port, such as sanitary-veterinary inspections. If in other European countries, through whose ports goods from outside the EU space are transited, an analysis takes a few hours, in Romania it can take several days. In addition, the access fees in the Romanian port are huge, probably justified only by the large number of salaries that must be paid to the employees. Their number is almost equal to that of the employees of the port of Rotterdam, with a volume of activity more than 25 times higher in favor of the Dutch.
The truth about the Dutch hesitations regarding Romania's accession to Schengen essentially lies in the internal policy of the Dutch government. More concretely, it is related to the fragility of the majority on which the government led by Mark Rutte is supported in the parliament. Invested almost 300 days after the legislative elections, the current government relies on a coalition made up of four parties. Among them, the Christian Union, a conservative party, which has only 9 members in parliament, 5 deputies out of 150 and 4 senators out of 75. This political formation strongly opposes immigration, especially the Islamic one from Central Asia and the Middle East. Fearing that the borders of the Schengen area will no longer be as well secured as before, this party is blackmailing the governing coalition with the breaking of the protocol, in case, in Brussels, the Netherlands will vote for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. Last but not least, our country's accession will not be possible without Bulgaria's, for both political and strictly geographical reasons. Unfortunately, our southern neighbors do not seem to be as ready for accession, which is why, regardless of Romania's situation, for the moment, the Schengen area stops at Nadlac customs.

In reality, there has never been a massive anti-NATO or anti-Ukraine demonstration in Romania, and on the published recordings no chants are heard and no placards are seen to suggest that it was such a protest. Moreover, the images that should illustrate the protests are from another season or even another country.
NEWS: Shame! As long as we can feed Ukraine, chant the Romanian protesters who do not support the policy of supporting Ukraine by the Romanian authorities.
""Romanians have been protesting for many years, but I have never seen anything like this before. I have never seen such great intolerance. People are against the redeployment of NATO troops on their territory. Here came the reply of the population. They started with slogans like ""we are not a bridgehead"", ""we can no longer feed Ukraine"", ""shame"" etc. and ended with street clashes. The authorities hid the truth about this event, nowhere was said about this protest"", informed a reader of the Telegram channel ""War Correspondents of the Russian Spring"".
NARRATIVE: Romanians protest en masse against NATO and the support policy for Ukraine.
CONTEXT: In recent years, the Russian government press promoted a series of false narratives about the desire of the peoples of Eastern Europe to leave NATO and the EU. The Russian press wrote that after joining the European and Euro-Atlantic structures, the Romanian state became poor, depopulated, controlled by Washington or Brussels, and the political elite from Bucharest makes decisions against the will of the people. These narratives have a double purpose: on the one hand, to show public opinion in Russia that the rapprochement with the West is a real catastrophe, and on the other hand, to sow Euroscepticism in Romanian society. After the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 a.c. the anti-NATO narratives are closely related to the anti-Ukrainian ones. NATO states are criticized for supporting Ukraine's defensive efforts, supplying it with weapons, ammunition, equipment and humanitarian aid.
OBJECTIVE: To show that NATO does not enjoy support in Romania and the citizens want the exit from the Alliance. To induce the idea that Ukraine does not enjoy support.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Demonstrations are a constant in Romanian public life. Only in the last decade have there been anti-austerity demonstrations, in 2012, to block exploitation in Rosia Montana, against corruption after the Colectiv tragedy, protests against GEO 13 or, during the pandemic, against the measures taken to stop the spread of Covid -19 etc. For several weeks, another wave of rallies and protests has been recorded. Some protesters demanded higher salaries and better working conditions, others requested the complete delimitation, diplomatically and economically, of Romania by the Russian Federation in the context of the invasion of Ukraine. There have also been protests by those dissatisfied with the ever-increasing energy prices or solidarity marches with the women of Iran. However, there were no significant anti-NATO or anti-Ukraine demonstrations; and if there were protests, their magnitude was so small that they went unnoticed by the press or the public. The clips posted by the Russian press or Telegram channels do not include any evidence of when they were filmed, representing a fragment of a protest, most likely in Bucharest, but without including evidence of the existence of anti-NATO or anti-Ukraine slogans. In fact, video footage can be used to illustrate any propaganda narrative.
The news was picked up by some portals from the Republic of Moldova, which published the video clip, citing ""a series of international publications"". In fact, only one source is cited - the online newspaper Pravda from Russia.
Moreover, the news is based on a comment by an anonymous reader who stated that the protests have a large scale, with great intolerance and that ""he has never seen anything like this"". At the same time, no one knows, according to to the Russian press, about these protests because the central press ignored them at the request of the authorities. From this it appears that there was an unprecedentedly large protest in Romania against NATO and Bucharest's policy of supporting Ukraine, with street clashes, but no one heard of him!
Another publication, the Ghall portal, publishes this news, illustrating it with two photos from the Bucharest protests in 2018. One of the photos clearly shows ""Down with PSD"". The pro-Kremlin publication Regnum writes about the protests in Romania, publishing a photo of protesters on the streets of Bucharest, in which some have umbrellas, and it is snowing outside. At least until the date of publication of this information, it did not snow in Bucharest, and the autumn turned out to be quite warm and without significant precipitation. The newspaper Izvestia de in Moscow he wrote about the anti-NATO protests in Bucharest, illustrating the information with a video report, but not from Romania, but from Germany. If in the text it is said about Romanians' dissatisfaction with the position in the context of the war in Ukraine, the video clip, taken from REN TV Moscow, reports about another protest in Berlin. Therefore, no Russian source has any evidence to prove that such protests took place in Romania.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian government media regarding the EU, NATO or the policy of some member states of these organizations. In June, the Russian press wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace. In May, Russian propaganda distributed information about the EU's fear of tuberculosis originating from NATO laboratories in Ukraine. In April, the pro-Kremlin press accused Ukraine of wanting to join NATO in order to attack Russia. Russian propaganda tries to convince the public opinion that half of the soldiers of the Ukrainian army are foreigners, which means that NATO is participating in the war. Publication / Media:

In reality, the politician's words were taken out of context, and Israel's refusal is determined by other reasons.
NEWS: Any weapon offered to Ukraine will end up in the hands of Iran, the former Prime Minister of Israel, who is currently the leader of the opposition, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in an interview for the American television station MSNBC.
""As far as weapons are concerned, I do not rule out that it will happen as it has happened more than once - the offered weapons will end up in the hands of Iran and will be used against us,"" the politician declared.
Netanyahu commented on Israel's current policy of supporting Ukraine, calling it ""a wise one"". Israel now accepts refugees (but in a limited number) and offers humanitarian aid.
[...]
We remind you that Israel's Minister for Diaspora Affairs, Nachman Shai, wrote on Twitter that ""there is no doubt about Israel's choice to support one side of the conflict"", considering the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev.
NARRATIVE: Israel will not deliver weapons to Ukraine so that they are not stolen or sold to Iran.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, in the interview given to the American television station MSNBC by the former prime minister of Israel, Ukraine is not accused of stealing or selling weapons from the West. Russian propaganda linked two different theses from Benjamin Netanyahu's interview to prove that Kiev is a partner of distrust.
The Israeli politician analyzed Israel's traditional reluctance to supply weapons to other states. ""On the Golan Plateau, where we tried not to allow Iran to create a second Lebanese front against us, another second terrorist front, we found weapons produced by Israel"", argued Benjamin Netanyahu, showing when and from where appeared this reluctance for the first time, without referring to Ukraine.
Then, Netanyahu declared that the decision to provide weapons to Ukraine or any other state is very complicated and atypical for Israeli politicians. The Russian media added that Ukraine traditionally steals and sells western weapons, and Netanyahu would have confirmed this in this interview. Various Russian news portals such as Ruskaia vesna, Eurasia Daily, News.ru and others wrote that Netanyahu directly accused Ukraine of stealing and/or selling foreign weapons to other states, the statement being a propaganda invention. Moreover, the press headlines say that Israel accused Ukraine at the state level. However, Netanyahu does not represent the authorities of his state, being an opposition politician.
In another interview with USA Today, quoted by The Jerusalem Post, the former prime minister said that he will ""analyze"" whether or not Israel will supply weapons to Ukraine if he returns to power after the upcoming elections. He also said that he expects to he is asked to be a mediator for the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. ""If I become prime minister, it is assumed that this matter of mediation will come up again,"" he said.
In fact, Israel seemed quite close to making a decision to supply weapons to Ukraine. However, after the former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the number two in the Russian Security Council, warned Israel not to deliver weapons to Ukraine because this would ""destroy"" its relationship with Russia, an Israeli official refused. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz reiterated that the country will not supply weapons to Ukraine, despite a new official request from Kiev for air defense systems. ""Israel supports and stands with Ukraine, NATO and the West. That said, I would like to emphasize that Israel will not deliver weapons systems to Ukraine due to a series of operational considerations. We will continue to support Ukraine within our limits, as we have done in the past,"" said the minister. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Israel has an interest in maintaining good relations with Russia because Israeli air activity in Syria requires Russia's consent.
The suspicions regarding the relations between Ukraine and Iran are an invention of the Russian media in the context of the deterioration of the relations between the two states. The MFA in Kiev directly accused Iran of supporting Russia, which commits war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba requested the Western states to impose additional sanctions on Iran. According to the head of Ukrainian diplomacy, the Tehran regime supplied Iranian drones to Russia, ""while telling us that it is against the war and that it does not support any of the parties"". the current context of degraded bilateral relations seem disconnected from reality.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media that aimed to present Ukraine as a vulnerable, unstable and dangerous international partner. The Russian government press wrote that because of Kiev's propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated by Russia, not occupied, while American scholars support Putin's ideas about Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to seize part of Ukraine, and various mercenaries from Israel are fighting against Russia alongside the soldiers of the ""Azov"" group.

In reality, digital identity can be used to obtain various public and private services even now, and digital currency represents another form of existence of money.
NEWS: The Deputy Director General of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently explained how Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) can be programmed to determine what people will or cannot buy and insisted that they should be used together with a Chinese-style social credit system. Unlike cryptocurrency, which is private, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will be issued and controlled by the central banks themselves. In many ways, they will be the same as banknotes, but each transaction will be monitored to track compliance.""
NARRATIVE: The world occult will bring humanity under control by imposing digital currencies and digital identity.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The theory of total control of humanity by elites is not new. It is constantly adapted, depending on the ongoing events, sometimes the narratives even end up contradicting each other. Many of them are maintained, in recent years, by propaganda from Russia and amplified through social networks and media institutions that promote conservative themes and support radical movements and those of nationalists, sovereignists or anti-vaxxers. In order to better understand the success enjoyed by this policy of Russia, it is good to know that, during the Covid19 pandemic, for example, 66% of Romanians believed the conspiracy theories that promoted the connection between the pandemic and the ""world occult"". Theories of the related conspiracy talked about imposing control through the digital passport, inventing the Omicron strain to impose global dictatorship, or using vaccines for evil purposes.
As, at present, the energy crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine will ultimately lead to a financial crisis, the topic of individual finances has become for some time the main narrative promoted by conspiracy theorists. In mid-October, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference took place with the title: ""Digital currencies of central banks for financial inclusion: risks and benefits"". The well-known conspiracy site The Expose brought to the attention of the public its own interpretation of the speeches of the guests , and a translation of the article was published on activenews.ro, which wrote that, soon, we will be able to use our own money only if the government allows us and we will be able to buy only what we are allowed to. Activenews is one of the most famous sources of fake news in the Romanian online, over time Veridica dismantled several conspiracy theories promoted on this site, just as the international press did with the false narratives promoted by the British counterpart, The Expose.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing the idea among public opinion that advanced technology in the financial field and the introduction of digital currencies are aimed at controlling occult forces over people.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The dialogue at the conference mentioned above was focused on increasing financial inclusion globally with the help of digital currencies issued by central banks. Financial inclusion is a concept through which people and businesses can access payment services and other safe, efficient and convenient financial services. For this purpose, the digital currency issued by a central bank (Central Bank Digital Currency - CBDC) does not have the role of replacing cash, but of complementing it. In financial language, we are talking about an electronic form of money, complementary to the other existing forms (cash and bank accounts) used for making fast and safe payments. A digital currency is money of a central bank. This means that it would be supported by a central bank, which has the responsibility of maintaining the value of money, regardless of its form, physical or digital. In terms of financial inclusion, a digital currency means that those who do not have a bank account can have easier and safer access to money and cashless payments. CBDCs are more profitable than physical money, because they have lower transaction costs and transfer times. They also reduce printing costs, because instead of printing money, the central bank issues electronic coins. Moreover, banking operations with CBDC are available 24/7, as they are not limited by bank schedules.
Returning to the narrative of the total control imposed by the ""occult"" through local governments, we must agree that the election of the former deputy governor of the Central Bank of China and current deputy director of the IMF, the Chinese Bo Li, to exemplify the way the entire financial system works digitally, she was not the happiest. But what the Chinese official stated has absolutely nothing to do with violating the right to private life or restricting any freedom. Targeting payments for social assistance, consumption coupons, meal vouchers, vacation etc. is already a real fact. Even in Romania, thousands of social cards have been cancelled, because they were used for completely different purposes than the one for which they were issued. As a principle for allocating social funds, their exact direction to the destination and recipients established from the start cannot be something imputable to the authorities, even against it.
Another objection brought by conspiracy theorists to the new technologies is the verification of digital identity, considered essential for the functioning of CBDCs, especially in international transactions.
Digital identity already exists and is becoming more and more relevant with each new loyalty card registered for cheaper drugs and cigarettes, with each free pack of cigarettes accepted in exchange for a phone number, and with each engagement on social media. It is not imposed on us, we build it ourselves. Also, the use of behavioral models deduced by a computer following the analysis of financial transactions is not a new thing. For years, our activity has been analyzed in real time by increasingly intelligent algorithms, and data about us is stored to personalize online experiences. The transaction of said data to third parties would not be something new, unfortunately, it has already happened, at incredibly high levels. But behind these illegal and immoral practices are not some occult minds, but normal people who are usually caught and punished. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: The embassies of the countries of the world withdraw from Kiev for fear of the Russian offensive
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media writes simultaneously about different topics to manipulate public opinion: the recommendations of the states for their citizens not to travel or to leave Ukraine as much as possible, in the conditions where Russia is bombing Ukrainian infrastructure targets and cities on a daily basis , and the decision of the embassies to withdraw from Kiev. For example, on October 10, the US Embassy in Kyiv urged American citizens to leave Ukraine, but American diplomats were not evacuated. And other states did the same. The embassies of the EU member states, including Romania, but also that of Great Britain, continue to operate in Kiev. On October 11, the British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, wrote on Twitter that the diplomatic representative is in Kiev and will continue to work there.
As for Serbia, this country withdrew its diplomats from Kiev in March and since then they have not returned to Ukraine. An undated announcement regarding the functioning of the diplomatic institution in Belgrade appeared on the embassy's website. The Serbian Embassy did not withdraw now, and not because it was informed about a major Russian offensive, but it has been in Belgrade for more than 7 months. Therefore, the narrative in question is built on the basis of false information.
To give this false information more credibility, the Russian press quotes two so-called experts: one Russian and another European. The Russian is, like all his fellow citizens accepted in the official media, obviously pro-Kremlin and a vector of its propaganda. The ""European expert"" is neither independent nor from any EU state. It is about Anatolii Sarii, a citizen of Ukraine who fled the country and was pursued by the Security Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, being accused of treason state. Over the course of several years, Sarii promoted Russia's propaganda narratives on the territory of Ukraine, founded a pro-Russian party, being a tool of the Kremlin in the Ukrainian political environment. After Sarii fled the country and hid in a European state, the Russian press invites him to broadcasts and quotes him in online publications, presenting him as an independent European expert.
The purpose of the propaganda message is to sow panic and disorientation within the Ukrainian society, but also to convince the public opinion in Russia that the ""special military operation"" is taking place successfully.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the duplicity of the West in the war in Ukraine and Russia's enormous military force. The Russian government press wrote that the Government in Kiev expressed its mistrust in its partners from the West, adding that terrorists are being trained on EU territory who will act against civilians in Donbass. Propaganda tried to convince public opinion that the West is asking Kiev to give in to Moscow, while Ukrainian refugees are housed in former Nazi concentration camps. Publication / Media:

1318,Russia withdrew from PACE because it did not want gays in the State Duma,['Russia withdrew from the APCE because it did not want gays in the State Duma'],False,[],"{'GPE': ['Russia'], 'ORG': ['PACE']}","{'WORK_OF_ART': ['State Duma'], 'PERSON': ['Vyacheslav Volodin'], 'NORP': ['Russian', 'russian'], 'GPE': ['Russia', 'lgbt'], 'ORG': ['APCE', 'the council of europe'], 'DATE': ['October 17']}",,,,,,,https://ukraina.ru/20221017/1039825550.html,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-rusia-s-a-retras-din-apce-pentru-ca-n-a-vrut-gay-in-duma-de-stat,,18.10.2022,,,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-rusia-s-a-retras-din-apce-pentru-ca-n-a-vrut-gay-in-duma-de-stat,,"Russia withdrew from PACE, in March 2022, because it does not have gay parliamentarians, although this is mandatory for the member states. The false narrative was launched by the president of the State Duma in Moscow, Viaceslav Volodin. In reality, Russia withdrew because it was going to be excluded from PACE due to the invasion of Ukraine. The subject was resurrected because PACE designated Russia as a terrorist state.
NEWS: ""The President of the State Duma Viaceslav Volodin declared that the absence of homosexual men in the Russian parliament was one of the reasons for Russia's withdrawal from the PACE. The statement was made on October 17 during the parliamentary hearings. According to Volodin, the vice-president of the State Duma, Piotr Tolstoy, received a form at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, according to which the lower and upper chambers of the Russian parliament must send representatives of the LGBT community to a joint meeting as a matter of priority. We don't have such representatives, that's why we didn't fill out the form [...].
Volodin stated that he received many addresses regarding the adoption of the law on the protection of traditional family values"".
NARRATIVE: Russia withdrew from PACE because it has no gay parliamentarians.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: For several years, the Putin regime has been trying to present Russia (for the external public and, especially for the internal public) as a besieged fortress, a space of traditional values ​​and morality that is in antithesis to ""Gayropa"". a space of depravity in which not only homosexuality, but also pedophilia are tolerated and encouraged. The West would be behind a real assault aimed at imposing the LGBT ideology in Russia.
The invasion of Ukraine isolated Russia internationally. The unjustified and unprovoked attack on an independent country, the brutality of the Russian army and the war crimes committed by it, from the bombing of civilian targets to summary executions, torture and rape, the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions, etc. they were condemned not only by the West, which became the main supporter of Ukraine, but also by NGOs specialized in human rights and international organizations (UN General Assembly, OSCE, APCE). Russia's response to this wave of condemnations caused by its aggression and crimes was to victimize itself and invent various pretexts and justifications, many of which have been used by Kremlin propaganda for years: that its values ​​are threatened, that it is fighting Nazism, that it is surrounded and attacked by the West, that it is the target of terrorist attacks, etc.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the delegations of the states in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe are not formed according to the ethnic principle, race or gender. APCE aims to defend human rights and promote diversity and tolerance. The state delegations to the PACE are composed of parliamentarians elected in free elections, and the Council of Europe cannot intervene or influence the citizens to choose certain candidates. Viaceslav Volodin's statement has no legal basis, and the non-representation of sexual minorities in parliament is not a reason for exclusion from the Council of Europe, nor for the withdrawal of the delegation. In fact, PACE decided to exclude the Russian Federation from the Council of Europe after the invasion of Ukraine, and the adopted document provides for the termination of membership for the Russian delegation due to its incompatibility with the organization's principles.
""There is no place for an aggressor in the common European home. The Committee of Ministers should request the Russian Federation to withdraw from the Council of Europe. If the Russian Federation does not comply with the request, the Committee of Ministers must consider the immediate possible date from which the Russian Federation ceases to be a member of the Council of Europe"", according to the APCE opinion.
Volodin claims that Russia was not excluded, but that it withdrew. In fact, knowing that the Russian delegation will be excluded from the organization, the representative of Moscow, Piotr Tolstoy, submitted an official letter of withdrawal from the Council of Europe in time. Therefore, Russia withdrew from the Council of Europe before being excluded. In the Russian press, there was no information about the exclusion of Russia, but about the withdrawal of the Russian delegation. The truth is hidden from Russian citizens in order to maintain public opinion in the internal informational space in which the need to carry out the ""special military operation"" is justified on a daily basis.
The false narrative was not picked up by accident. On October 13, PACE designated Russia as a terrorist state by adopting a resolution entitled ""The escalation continues in Russia's aggression against Ukraine"". 99 members of the assembly voted for the resolution, and one abstained. Russian propaganda tries to demonstrate to public opinion that this resolution has no value, it is not representative, arguing that Russia intentionally withdrew from there.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the positions of international organizations regarding the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that the referendums on the annexation to Russia of the territories in the east and south of Ukraine respect the UN Charter, and the UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control Ukraine's seaports.
According to some propaganda narratives, the OSCE collaborates with the ""Azov"" regiment in Mariupol and provides it with information from the very beginning of the conflict in Donbass, while the West investigates the atrocities committed by Ukrainian nationalists on the territory of Ukraine.

NEWS: ""The Commission for Exceptional Situations of the Republic of Moldova prohibited the organization of protest actions on working days. And during rest periods, their duration cannot exceed four hours. Also, on working days, demonstrators do not have the right to block transport arteries and access to public institutions""
NARRATIVE: The pro-European government in Chisinau has turned into an authoritarian regime that prohibits anti-government protests.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In Chisinau, protest actions organized by the Sor Party, led by the fugitive oligarch Ilan Sor, convicted in the first instance for the bank robbery of approximately one billion dollars in 2014, have been taking place in Chisinau for a month. These are taking place in the context of a deep economic and social crises caused by inflation and the war in Ukraine.
The demonstrators set up tents in the center of Chisinau, and on October 9 they blocked Stefan cel Mare boulevard, the city's main road, making traffic difficult and causing traffic jams on Monday morning, until the police removed the tents. Later, the police announced that they found prohibited items in the tents.
OBJECTIVE: To present the pro-European government in Chisinau as authoritarian and anti-democratic.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The authorities did not ban protests on weekdays, as the Russian publication writes, but blocked the streets on those days. ""The holding of meetings with the blocking of traffic lanes, transport arteries or access and evacuation routes to public institutions will be prohibited on working days. On days off, these meetings can be held for a maximum of four hours"", according to the CSE decision.
It should be noted that a state of emergency was decreed in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis caused by it, a valid measure, following several extensions, including the current period. During the state of emergency, protests are prohibited. Some political scientists recommended the government to make use of this provision, but the representatives of the executive stated that they will allow peaceful protests to take place.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: After the demonstrators of the Sor Party blocked the Stefan cel Mare boulevard in Chisinau, the Commission for Exceptional Situations really imposed certain prohibitions related to the organization of protests. Publication / Media:

In reality, the massive attack killed dozens of civilians on the territory of Ukraine, and rockets hit houses, parks, critical and social infrastructure, Russia being accused of terrorism.
NEWS: ""Russia's recent attack on Ukrainian infrastructure was a ""symbolic"" one. Russia must not fight with half strength if it wants to defeat Ukraine, the Polish publicist and political scientist said in an interview for Ukraina.ru Konrad Rekas [...].
You will not succeed in building a new world order if you have mercy and fight with half power. If you don't have the necessary will to fight - you have to make peace. If you want to be victorious - you have to fight much more seriously"", writes Ukraina.ru, quoting Rekas.
In another article, Ukraina.ru mentions that ""the Kiev regime systematically organizes terrorist attacks on Russian citizens"", and Moscow is forced to respond and liberate all regions of Ukraine. The Polish political scientist is again quoted: Stalin didn't just drive Hitler to the former borders of the USSR. He didn't tell Rokossovski on the Bug: ""Enough, it's not our territory anymore, stop the denazification! Organize a referendum there and go home! Don't bomb the no one there because the media from the West will write badly about us"".
NARRATIVE: Russia showed restraint when it launched the massive attack by which it reacted to the bombing of the Kerchi bridge.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: On October 10, Russia launched 84 missiles and 24 drones at Ukraine, with an average total value of 700 million dollars, according to Forbes. More than half of the missiles were shot down by the anti-aircraft defense system, according to Kiev. On October 11, Russia launched 28 missiles at Ukraine, of which 20 were allegedly shot down. Also, 13 Iranian drones were shot down, as Kiev claims. If all the missiles hit the target, the destruction in Ukraine would have been at least 2-3 times greater and many more civilians would have been killed.
The official explanation was that the bombings represent Russia's response to the explosion that damaged the Kerch bridge, illegally built by Russia to make a land connection with the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, invaded and illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014. Ukraine has not admitted any responsibility in the explosion that damaged the bridge, which for Vladimir Putin has a great symbolic significance. The bombings also took place against the backdrop of Ukrainian victories on the front both in the east of Ukraine and in the south. It should be noted that the targets were civilians - either residential areas or infrastructure elements (30% of the energy sector was damaged) - without any military value, which shows that the civilian population was the target, aiming to demoralize and terrorize it .
Finally, it should be noted that since the beginning of the war, civilians have repeatedly been the target of Russian attacks, among the notable cases being the bombing of the theater in Mariupol, the station in Kramatorsk, the convoy near Zaporozhye, etc. To these are added the numerous Russian attacks on residential areas, educational and medical institutions, the thousands of war crimes, from summary executions, torture and forced displacement to rapes, documented by international organizations and the Ukrainian prosecutor's office. They all point to a strategy that includes the intentional attack of civilian targets, in no case can it be said that the Russians are making efforts to avoid such targets.
The international community condemned the latest attacks (as it did before, in similar situations), and a spokesman for the EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy Josep Borrell, Peter Stano, said that Russia's actions appear to be, ""war crimes"", and those who are guilty of them must ""account"".
On October 13, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) designated Russia as a terrorist state by adopting a resolution entitled ""Continued escalation in Russian aggression against Ukraine"".
Despite these reactions of the international community, the Russian press tries to justify the missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, quoting a Polish political scientist known for his radical pro-Russian positions and in favor of aggression against Ukraine, who collaborated in the last 10 years with various television stations and newspapers from Moscow. Konrad Rekas was a member of various Polish nationalist parties, he was a columnist and correspondent of Pravda newspaper from Moscow. The Polish political scientist is also a member of the European Center for Geopolitical Analysis, based in Poland and which has branches in Russia. This center, according to the Russian media, sent observers to various elections in separatist regions such as Ossetia, Abkhazia or Transnistria.
Rekas does not represent Polish academia, most of the time illustrating Russian propaganda narratives like many other experts from abroad who collaborate with the pro-Kremlin press.
Based on the statements of Rekas, the Russian press is trying to convince the public opinion that the attacks did not affect the lives of civilians in Ukraine and that Russia's war is a fair one, with a human face.
The same Konrad Reka calls the Russian army to be tougher and to ""denazify"" all Ukrainian regions, making false allusions to the history of the Second World War.
In reality, the Ukrainian army cannot be compared in any way to the Nazi troops, and Russia's war is one of invading a territory, an unprovoked act of aggression condemned by the international community.
In July 2015, Ukraine banned by law any public manifestation of communist and Nazi ideology, so the statement that this state must be ""denazified"" is meaningless. In addition, Ukrainian soldiers participated in the Soviet army's victory over Nazism.
141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine and that it is a terrorist state.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media, according to which the inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region are waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince the Russian society without any evidence that the nationalist leader Stepan Bandera was canonized in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

The information was subtly slipped in at the beginning of the dialogue by Lazarus and later developed by Diana Sosoaca.
Declared the political personality of the year 2021 by sputnik.md, Senator Diana Iovanovici Sosoaca has been noticed over time through various scandals in which she was involved, but also through the promotion of theses, false narratives and disinformation very similar to those launched in Russia. Initially visible by participating in the protests against the so-called ""medical dictatorship"", whose central figures were close to the embassy of the Russian Federation in Bucharest, Diana Sosoaca spread some disinformation and fake news regarding the coronavirus and the anti-Covid vaccine (see , for example, the narrative dismantled by Veridica according to which the vaccine would cause sterility for three generations), and made efforts to combat the vaccination campaign. At the same time, he promoted sovereignist and anti-EU theses (including the denial of the existence of the war in Ukraine) which , have also appeared over time in numerous disinformation and false narratives originating in Russia.
In the narrative regarding Hidroelectrica, the name Rotschild is also circulated. For generations, this family has been the target of conspiracy theories that are, in essence, anti-Semitic; most recently, there was talk about Rothschild in the context of the war in Ukraine: a conspiracy theory, also promoted in Romania by Cozmin Gusa, says that Rothschild would have bought the entire debt of Ukraine; the thesis regarding the intention of the Rothschild group to seize the assets of Romania and the Romanians is a similar one.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the authorities and the entire political class, as well as promoting the sovereignist, anti-Western discourse.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In her characteristic style, Senator Sosoaca presents truncated real information, in order to distort the overall picture. Indeed, The Bank of New York Mellon currently owns shares in Fondul Proprietatea, but only 14.20% of the shares. The percentage held is decreasing compared to the beginning of the year when BNY Mellon held 16.63% of the shares. In 2018, for example, the same financial institution held 28.90% of the fund's shares. It is also true that the two private pension funds mentioned (NN and Allianz-Tiriac) are shareholders of the fund, but that is only because they bought shares from the free market. The purpose of any pension fund is to make a profit, in its own interest and that of the depositors; we do not see how the Romanian state could have prevented the purchase of the respective shares by any investor on the stock exchange in a free market.
The statement ""Fondul Proprietatea no longer belongs to the Romanians"" is invalid from the start, as the respective fund never belonged to the Romanians, but only to the Romanians who own shares in this fund. But, even so, currently, the FP shareholding structure is presented as follows: 72.47% - Romanian institutional shareholders + Romanian natural persons + Ministry of Public Finance + FP own shares and 27.53% - BNY Mellon + Foreign institutional shareholders + Non-resident natural persons. Regarding the chairmanship of Fondul Proprietatea and the former American ambassador Mark Gitenstein , Diana Sosoaca uses another truncated truth, that, indeed, the American diplomat was part of the Committee of Representatives of the Proprietatea Fund, but he never held the position of president, as suggested a year ago by the anti-Semitic publication Incorect Political. The rest of the information are just narratives taken from the media of the times when Traian Basescu was president of Romania and Laura Codruta Kovesi was the chief prosecutor of the DNA, seasoned with personal speculations.
The same type of discourse (fragments of truth and extremely subjective forecasts) is also used when the senator brings up Hidroelectrica S.A. ""Hydroelectrica will no longer be Romanian"" is the verdict given by the people's senator, immediately after announcing that ""the shareholders' committee requested and said that it will ignore everything that the Romanian leadership says, that they are only slaves, and they will rate it"" and at the London Stock Exchange."" We don't know exactly what he means when he says the shareholders' committee, but we know that the Hidroelectrica General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) has only two members: the Romanian state through the Ministry of Energy and Fondul Proprietatea. Thus, in the AGM decision no. 3/31.03.2022, only the initiation of the admission to trading of the shares held by FP on the Bucharest Stock Exchange was approved. Neither in this document, nor in the others issued later, listing on the London Stock Exchange is requested. For the sake of analysis, we will go further on the narrative thread of Mrs. Sosoaca and assume that, once listed on the London Stock Exchange, the 19.94% shares will all be bought by Rothschild. Making a parenthesis, we see no reason why this fact should not happen after the listing of the company in Bucharest or that through the listing in Bucharest not even one share should be sold and all of them end up for sale in London. But this time we will give credit to a dignitary of the Romanian state. Next, the senator from Iasi tells us that there will be a capital increase, so that the respective owner of the shares becomes the majority. What the senator does not say is that the capital increase can only be made after changing the company's articles of incorporation. An equally interesting legal procedure, the amendment of the constitutive act can only be done on the basis of a decision of the General Assembly, an assembly in which the Romanian state will still have a vote of 80.06%. It is true that voices from the management of Fondul Proprietatea suggested a dual listing of the shares, but the Romanian state requested the listing of the shares only on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. In conclusion, putting up for sale the almost 20 percent of Hidroelectrica shares is a commitment taken by the Romanian government through PNRR, part of chapter R3: Improving the corporate governance of state companies in the sector, and in no case an evil alienation plan of the country's resources.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The representatives of Fondul Proprietatea say that the banks with which they had discussions regarding the listing of Hidroelectrica concluded that the listing of the 20% package of the fund is difficult to achieve only on the BVB and that the listing should also take place on the London Stock Exchange.

In reality, the International Legion within the Ukrainian army has small numbers, and the NATO leadership has repeatedly declared that it will not intervene militarily in the war.
NEWS: ""When the representation of the foreign contingent within the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be greater than 50%, NATO's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine will pass from the de facto to the de jure status,"" the military espionage veteran said live on Soloviov Live , the hero of Russia, Rustem Klupov, according to the ""PolitNavigator"" correspondent.
[...]
""According to Russian intelligence data, 30% of the Ukrainian army is composed of foreign mercenaries, but soon the number of foreigners will exceed 50%. We are not far from seeing in the near future how they will change their uniform to the national one and will be presented to us as regular NATO troops"", said Klupov.
The presenter Vladimir Solovyov recalled that there are already several thousand Poles in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
""For now, we are told that they are not NATO troops, but national military forces from Poland. They distance themselves declaratively from NATO membership. ""NATO troops are military formations that are directly subordinated to the Alliance,"" the expert explained.
NARRATIVE: Half of the soldiers of the Ukrainian army are foreigners, which means that NATO is participating in the war.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The number of foreign soldiers in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is not 30% or 50%. In the context of Ukraine's successful counter-offensive in the east and north of the country, Russian propaganda resumed a series of false narratives regarding the numerous battalions of English, French, Poles and representatives of other states fighting in Ukraine. On the show of the Russian journalist Vladimir Solovyov, the failures of the Russian army on the battlefield are explained, most of the time, by the de facto presence of NATO troops on the territory of Ukraine.
In reality, NATO troops are not fighting on the territory of Ukraine. The Secretary General of the Alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, has repeatedly stated that NATO does not have regular troops on Ukrainian territory. ""We have the responsibility to prevent this conflict from expanding beyond the borders of Ukraine and becoming an open war between Russia and NATO,"" Stoltenberg said. On the other hand, a number of Western states provide Ukraine with weapons, equipment , ammunition, necessary for Kiev's defense of its territory from the aggression of the Russian Federation.
The Russian press misinforms the public opinion when it reports on the foreign soldiers who make up 30-50% of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In May a.c. President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that Ukraine is defended against Russian aggression by a number of 700,000 soldiers. He said that Ukraine has well-trained soldiers, and NATO states have modern weaponry that must be offered to Ukraine and that could change the situation on the battlefield.
In March 2022, over 20 thousand volunteers from countries such as the USA, Norway, Denmark, but also from the Republic of Moldova and Belarus submitted applications for registration in the International Legion. Therefore, the number of those who have registered in the International Legion up to the present moment cannot be 350 thousand, that is 50% of the army. Moreover, the International Legion also includes citizens of post-Soviet states that have no connection with NATO. For example, 4 battalions of Chechen soldiers are fighting on the territory of Ukraine, who oppose the aggression of the Russian Federation and support their leader in exile, Ahmed Zakaev.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aim to present NATO as an active participant in the war in Ukraine. In June, the Russian press wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace. In May, Russian propaganda distributed information about the EU's fear of tuberculosis originating from NATO laboratories in Ukraine. In April, the pro-Kremlin press accused Ukraine of wanting to join NATO in order to attack Russia. Publication / Media:

Although statistically speaking, in this case the incidence of the disease is four times higher than normal, the experts have not established until the time of publication of the article a common cause of the disease in the four young athletes. In addition, it is not even known whether or not they are vaccinated against Covid19.
NEWS: ""The German sports world is in shock: Four players from Germany have testicular cancer. Terrifying, four footballers, all diagnosed with the same type of cancer.
ActiveNews has warned since June 2021 that the spike protein of the Pfizer ""vaccine"" can affect the ovaries and testicles, according to a confidential Japanese study.
The ""spike"" protein of the antiCovid19 vaccine enters the bloodstream, which can explain thousands of adverse effects, from blood clots and heart disease to brain damage and reproductive problems.""
NARRATIVE: Vaccination against the coronavirus causes testicular cancer and leads to infertility.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: Ever since the beginning of the Covid19 pandemic, a series of false narratives have appeared in Romania regarding the nature and origin of the SARS-CoV2 virus, the measures taken to combat its spread, or the effectiveness and effects of vaccination. Among the promoters of these false narratives are supporters of conspiracy theories, radical Orthodox, sovereignists, Euro-skeptics, anti-Westerners, dacoits and Kremlin spokesmen. In support of the statements made, Activenews.ro does not present even one medical proof. They also seek to validate their theories through pseudo-experts, anonymous websites or by falsely quoting various studies.
Veridica has already dismantled several fake news and misinformation about the antiCovid19 vaccine, that it would cause sterility for three generations or that it would not be effective and would have serious adverse effects.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the anti-vaccine culture and inducing fear among those who get vaccinated against Covid19 or who would intend to get vaccinated.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: Without having any proof in this sense, the author of the article induces from the title the idea that the illness of the four footballers would have occurred due to the vaccination against Covid19. In reality, it is not known until the publication date of the article, neither if the four athletes were vaccinated against Covid19 nor the exact cause of the appearance of testicular cancer in the four particular cases.
With all the current scientific advances, the exact cause of testicular cancer (a disease manifested by the development of abnormal cells in the testicular tissue, with increased-chaotic reproductive potential, which the body is not able to limit through physiological processes) is still unknown. Scientists have identified over time several factors likely to cause this disease: cryptorchidism (undescended testicle), inguinal hernia, family history, Klinefelter's syndrome and ""supermale"" syndrome (genetic diseases) or irradiation of the area But, although these conditions can increase the risk of the disease, they are not mandatory, nor are they the basis of most testicular cancers.
What we know for sure, however, is that the appearance of testicular cancer in athletes is not new, on the contrary, it is a phenomenon studied for a long time by doctors. There are already several theories related to the subject, such as that of the urologist Frank Sommer, a professor at the University of Hamburg, who states that boys who intensively practice various sports before puberty have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer, regardless with genetic factors. One of the causes taken into consideration by the renowned German doctor is the extreme sensitivity of the intimate area to sudden and radical changes in body temperature, caused by physical exertion. However, the studies related to this theory are still in the early stages and it will take many years until a scientifically valid conclusion is reached.
The Japanese ""confidential"" study to which the material in question refers is actually the fragment of the pharmacokinetic study of the research related to the antiCovid19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. It followed, after vaccination, the path in the body of the fat particles that contain the genetic sequence of RNA spike protein messenger Without it being a secret at all, the entire study was validated by the European Medicines Agency as early as February 2021.
Apart from the study conducted by Pfizer, which could reasonably be suspected of subjectivity and manipulation of the results, several doctors and scientists have researched the same thing, and their conclusions coincided with those of the vaccine manufacturer: the spike protein is harmless, it only stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies.

In reality, Ukraine does not produce dirty bombs, nor does it intend to attack its own population, while nuclear blackmail is increasingly present in the speeches of Russian politicians.
NEWS: ""The sabotage that caused three leaks at the Nord Stream gas pipeline is just a test. The Americans are preparing future terrorist acts on Russian territory, which will involve the destruction of large infrastructure targets,"" the political scientist said live on Russia 1 Dmitri Evstafiev, quoted by the PolitNavigator correspondent.
""I have no doubt that Zelenski already ordered the production of a dirty bomb and its use, most likely, in the southern direction. I think that this dirty bomb will be used by Ukraine in the coming weeks. We will have to stop hiding our heads in the sand and stop saying that we were not notified. We must be prepared for the use by the Kiev regime of the dirty bomb on the regions that are reuniting with Russia,"" said Evstafiev.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine will use a ""dirty"" radiological bomb in the south of the country.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, only Russia can use a nuclear bomb or a ""dirty"" bomb. Both the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, various parliamentarians or governors have blackmailed Ukraine and the West several times, threatening the use of nuclear weapons. Even during the signing ceremony of the ""unification agreement with Russia"" of the regions illegally annexed by the Russian army, Putin alluded to the American precedent of using the nuclear bomb during the Second World War World. In fact, since the beginning of the regime, Putin or other Moscow officials have made multiple references to Russia's nuclear arsenal, they have talked about using it to defend Russia's territory (which, in their view, includes the illegally annexed regions), and the leader Chechen Ramzan Kadyrov, a close associate of Putin, explicitly called for the bombing of Ukraine with tactical nuclear weapons.
The dirty bomb or radiological weapon combines radioactive material with conventional explosives, with the aim of radioactive contamination in the dispersion area of ​​the conventional explosive agent. This type of bomb - which until now has not been used - came to attention in the context of the terrorist attacks committed by Al Qaeda, when concerns arose that the jihadist group could try to manufacture a dirty bomb.
Kiev does not have any program to produce nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, a fact confirmed by a report by the UN High Representative for disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsu. At the same time, terrorist activity or intentional pollution of the environment is prohibited by law. Ukraine directly assumes, by law no. 25 of 2003, to combat and prevent technological terrorism, which includes the use of any type of bombs.
At the same time, Ukraine does not recognize Russia's annexation of the regions in the east and south of the country, and the use of a radiological weapon on these territories, especially in the context of a successful offensive both in the south and in the east, seems devoid of any logic and it goes against the military doctrine of Ukraine. Kiev has no interest in bombing and attacking the Ukrainian population in the south of the country with radiological or other weapons. The Ukrainian citizens there are waiting for liberation, opposing the invasion of the Russian occupation from the very beginning through rallies, protests, blockades, etc.
The narrative in question is a continuation of the classic metanarrative regarding the genocide of the Russian-speaking population of Donbass, which, apparently, is carried out by Kiev through terrorist methods. The dirty bomb, in fact, is a tool of the groups that apply terror to the population. According to analytical reports, these bombs are intended to induce fear, sow panic and discourage the defensive or offensive efforts of the enemy. The purpose of distributing this narrative is to accustom the public opinion in Russia to the idea that a nuclear disaster could occur in the south of Ukraine, but not through the fault of Russia, but of Kiev, supported by the West.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding an alleged danger of Ukraine causing a nuclear incident. The Russian press wrote that the IAEA mission praised the Russian army for defending the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant from Ukrainian bombings. In August, the Russian press wrote that at the behest of the US, Kiev would cause a nuclear disaster in Zaporozhye, following another false narrative, according to which an explosion would be caused to hide the traces of American biological weapons laboratories.

NEWS: ""Preparations have begun for the organization of a referendum on the annexation of the Ukrainian region of Lviv to Poland. The ballots in Ukrainian with the Polish stamp have already arrived in the region.
Such a referendum could be predicted in the context of the unprecedented intensification of military and civil cooperation between Ukraine and Poland.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, told the Polish leader Andrzej Duda on September 22 that he is ready to organize referendums in the regions of Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankovsk to join these territories to Poland, former deputy of the Supreme Rada Ilia Kiva writes on his channel Telegram.
[...]
The Verkhovna Rada adopted a law equalizing the rights of Poles and Ukrainians. It is assumed that the Ukrainian authorities accepted this bill in exchange for the supply of fuel and weapons.""
NARRATIVE: A referendum for joining Poland will be organized in the Lviv region.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, in the Lviv region there are no preparations for holding a referendum on joining Poland, and the information about the ballot papers stamped by the Polish authorities and Zelenski's promise to allow the annexation is a fabrication.
The news is based on a post on Telegram by former Ukrainian parliamentarian Ilia Kiva, a member of some pro-Kremlin parties, who fled to Russia at the very beginning of the large-scale invasion of Ukraine. Being on the territory of Russia, Kiva would have confirmed that Zelensky is ready ""to organize referendums in Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankovsk regions"".
On the official pages of the Polish and Ukrainian presidents, in the Ukrainian or international press, we do not find any information about such a discussion between Zelenski and Duda. Ilia Kiva is wanted internationally by Ukraine for supporting separatism and collaborating with Russia.
Referendums of this kind are prohibited by the legislation in force in Ukraine, something reiterated by Kiev in the context in which Moscow orchestrated so-called popular consultations in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporozhye and Kherson. These were also condemned by Poland, and the country's president, Andrzej Duda, declared that fake referendums have nothing in common with democracy.
According to Article 73 of the Constitution of Ukraine, territorial changes can be the subject of a national referendum. So, local or regional referendums do not legally change the territorial ownership of some Ukrainian regions.
On September 29, the secretary of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland, Stanislaw Zaryn, wrote on Twitter that ""Russian propaganda continues to attack Poland with information, repeating the lie about the plans of the Polish authorities to attack Ukraine and annex the Ukrainian west""
The purpose of this narrative is to justify in the eyes of the Russian community the organization of fake referendums in the south and east of Ukraine, after which part of four Ukrainian regions were illegally annexed by Russia. Also, the aim is to exonerate Russia by transferring the blame to Ukraine's neighbors, who, apparently, seek to divide the Ukrainian state.
Poland was the most vocal and active of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts, becoming a target of Russian propaganda. The Polish leaders support Ukraine and declare that the territorial integrity of the neighboring state is very important for the international law system.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding Poland's ""desire"" to annex Ukrainian territories. The Russian media wrote that Warsaw will start a war against Moscow in the next 10 years, while the majority of Poles support the invasion of the western regions Ukraine. A series of false narratives appeared after Sergei Nariskin, the head of Russian espionage, accused Poland of wanting to take over its ""historical territories"" from Ukraine, using the weakening of the Ukrainian state. According to Russian propaganda, the President of Poland admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories, and Kiev would have allowed 10 thousand soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country.

In reality, Western states did not send observers to the so-called referendums, and the ""experts"" cited by the Russian press were born in the West, but have lived in Russia for many years and support the Kremlin's policies.
NEWS: ""The international observers declared that they did not observe any violations during the referendum [...]
Independent political analyst from France Moro Xavier Bernard, who monitored how refugees vote on the territory of Russia, but also in the People's Republic of Donetsk, said that Kiev continues to bomb Donetsk on the day of the vote.

The Italian diplomat Vito Grittani, founder of the International Diplomatic Observatory, registered at the socio-economic department of the UN NGO, also said that the referendum took place in accordance with international standards.

There were no registered cases of multiple voting, there was no pressure on the participants in the referendum or ignorance of the voting procedure by the citizens,"" said the diplomat.
NARRATIVE: Observers from the West confirm that the referendums in Donbass, Kherson and Zaporizhia respected democratic standards.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, no observers from Western countries participated in the pseudo-referendums in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporozhye and Kherson. Both the EU member countries and the USA have clearly said that they will never recognize the referendums, both before and during their development, as well as after the announcement of the results by Moscow.
According to the Ukrainian government, only a few states - most of them authoritarian and/or partners with Moscow - sent observers to the fake referendums in eastern and southern Ukraine: Belarus, Syria, Egypt, Brazil, Venezuela, Uruguay, Togo and South Africa. Therefore, Italy, France, Germany and other Western countries did not send observers and do not recognize these fake referendums as legitimate.
The news published by RIA NOVOSTI is based on a series of false information. Moro Xavier Bernard is not an independent French expert, but a businessman, originally from France, who has been living on the territory of Russia for more than 20 years. He wrote philosophy books in which he praises Vladimir Putin, knows the Russian language, collaborates with the institutions of the Russian state. In other words, he is not an international observer, he does not represent France, but he is a Russian resident with French origins.
Vito Grittani is presented as an Italian diplomat, but he has been living in Russia for several years, has the citizenship of the separatist region of Abkhazia and is its ""Ambassador Plenipotentiary"", and in 2019 the Russian press wrote about his visit to the Transnistrian region as ""Ambassador plenipotentiary"" of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Abkhazia, as stated on its website, in an article dedicated to Grittani's visit to another separatist republic supported by Moscow, Transnistria.
The press from Abkhazia presents Grittani as a local diplomat who fights for the interests of the separatist republic.
Therefore, the people who praised the ""democratic way"" of conducting the fake referendums in the east and south of Ukraine are not international observers, they did not represent Western states, they have been living on the territory of Russia for many years and constantly support the separatist projects of the Kremlin in the post-soviet space.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aim to legitimize Russia's actions on the territory of Ukraine. The Russian press also wrote that the referendums on joining Russia of the territories in the east and south of Ukraine respect the UN Charter, while the inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region are waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis. Russian propaganda shows that the UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control Ukraine's seaports, and the south of Ukraine, freed from nationalists, wants to be annexed to Russia.

In reality, General Serghei Krivonos spoke about the civilian casualties as a result of the start of Russia's war against Ukraine.
NEWS: Ukraine's losses during the military confrontation with Russia have already reached hundreds of thousands of people, the former deputy secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, the former deputy chief of the Special Operations Forces of Ukraine, General Sergei Krivonos.
The general believes that the civilians have all the credit for not allowing the capitulation of Ukraine. They organized themselves, and the authorities did nothing for this. ""It is our enormous merit and we have the right to tell the authorities: why didn't you do anything, why are there tens, and now even hundreds of thousands of victims, why did they die?""
Krivonos added that Ukraine has lost 20 percent of its territory so far, and the recovery of these lands will cost the state ""tens of thousands of human lives"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine has lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers, according to a general from Kiev.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukrainian General Serghei Krivonos did not talk about the army's losses, but about the civilians killed by the Russian billionaires. The Ukraina.ru portal intentionally misquotes Krivonos, mentions a YouTube channel that interviewed him, but without publishing a hyperlink to make it impossible to verify the information.
Krivonos told the Ukrainian Media Network that Russia killed civilians on the territory of Ukraine and caused enormous destruction. He recalled tens of thousands of people killed in Mariupol, but also in the Kharkiv and Kiev regions.
""In Mariupol alone, 87,000 people died and I think it is not the final information. Who will explain what happened to them to their relatives and friends, if they are still alive?"" said the Ukrainian general without making any reference in the interview to the losses of the Ukrainian army.
The false narrative regarding the losses has resurfaced from time to time over the past few weeks on Telegram channels and news portals in Russia and the occupied territories to sow panic, discourage Ukrainian resistance and block Kiev's defensive efforts. The title draws attention, which tells the readers about a real catastrophe for the Ukrainian army, while the general did not speak at all about the military losses of his state.
The actual losses of the Ukrainian army in the war are not known. In fact, both sides try to present small figures of their losses. At the end of August, Valeri Zalujni, the Chief of Staff of the Ukrainian Army, declared that Ukraine lost 9 thousand soldiers in the war. In an interview granted to some French publications, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared on September 24 that approximately 50 Ukrainian soldiers die daily, but that these losses would be five times lower than those recorded by Russia. The highest estimates of the Ukrainian side, which appeared during the battle for the Luhansk region, in the summer, were 200 Ukrainians killed per day; even if this level had been maintained throughout the war (but this option is excluded, given that the intensity of the fighting varied), it cannot be about hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers killed, as the Russian government press writes ; at such a level of losses, to which the wounded would be added, the Ukrainian army would no longer exist at this moment. Finally, not only Ukraine but also the West appreciates that Kiev's losses are somewhat lower than those recorded by Moscow's forces. The maximum estimates, which belong to Ukraine, are 57,200 Russians killed, while the Pentagon estimated, at the beginning of August, that the total number of dead and wounded registered by Russia would be up to 80 thousand.
Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives aimed at discouraging Ukrainian resistance in the war. The Russian press wrote, for example, that the EU states will ask Ukraine to yield to Russia, and American scientists support all Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace, while Ukraine is mobilizing a million soldiers, paying with human beings for Western loans.

The authorities of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics and the administrations of the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions have decided to organize a series of referendums on joining Russia as subjects of the Federation.
NARRATIVE: Referendums on joining Russia of the territories in the east and south of Ukraine respect the UN Charter
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: According to Sergei Lavrov's argument, the local leaders want the territories of southern and eastern Ukraine to join Russia, and Moscow cannot but support this process, which corresponds to international law. Lavrov is actually trying to manipulate public opinion. The regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia are partially occupied by Russia, and an occupation regime is operating in the territories.
The UN Charter prohibits the invasion of one state by another. In the case of Russia, it is a violation of the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. Russia itself violated the UN Charter, a series of bilateral agreements, memoranda, etc., starting the war in Ukraine. According to the Declaration of the Principles of International Law, cited by Lavrov, every people has the right to self-determination, but without outside support, that is, without actions by third parties to violate territorial inviolability. Russia, however, violated this principle, and the referendums organized by it in Donbass, Kherson and Zaporozhye are non-transparent, do not respect the basic electoral rules and take place under conditions of occupation and war.
More than that, international recognition is also very important. Lavrov declared that the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics was recognized by South Ossetia and Abkhazia - two separatist republics funded by Moscow and not recognized internationally - and by Syria and North Korea, pariah states, subject to international sanctions, with dictatorial regimes brutes who are allied with Russia.
The referendums held by Russia will not be recognized by the international community. Firm signals in this regard have already been given by numerous officials, including the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said that through Russia's actions in Donbass and southern Ukraine, the international order is being destroyed, and the European foreign ministers, who condemned the plans to organize of referendums regarding the annexation of the occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia and stated that they will never recognize their results.
While the international community criticizes Russia for repeatedly violating international law, Sergey Lavrov supports the opposite. According to the UN Declaration, which Lavrov only partially quotes, the member states must refrain from any actions that will determine ""the total or partial dismemberment of the territorial integrity or political unity of the sovereign and independent states, which take into account in the actions their principle of the right to self-determination of peoples"".
Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives in which the subject of international law was used as a justification for the war. In May a.c. the Russian press wrote that the Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for military purposes, the information being confirmed by the UN. In August, Russian propaganda demonstrated that the UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control Ukraine's seaports, after in April Russian television stations reported on the discussion between Vladimir Putin and Antonio Guterres, after which the Kremlin leader convinced the secretary UN General that the Ukrainian Nazis must be tried at the International Criminal Court.

The partial mobilization is presented as a step towards de-escalation, a necessary measure for diplomatic dialogue and the prevention of a nuclear disaster or a war on Russian territory.
NEWS: ""The President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, is trying to prevent a nuclear disaster. His speech from September 21 is seen by specialists not only as a patriotic message addressed to the Russians, but also as a challenge to the West collectively and personally to President Joe Biden. According to political scientists, Putin spoke openly about a great danger, but he did so in order to find a way to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine.
[...]
The international situation in the war zone forced Putin to resort to partial mobilization, political scientist Boris Mejuev told URA.RU. ""In this situation, de-escalation will occur through escalation. The problem needs to be solved once and for all. The solution will be found through a new strong strike [...] Kiev depends on the US, which can force Ukraine to sit down at the negotiating table. Either Washington will understand this message and return to the diplomatic process or events will take an unpredictable turn"".
NARRATIVE: The partial mobilization ordered by Putin will prevent a nuclear disaster, will lead to a de-escalation of the conflict and a diplomatic dialogue.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: On September 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization of Russians who can fight. Putin also suggested that Russia could use its nuclear arsenal.
The mobilization concerns, first of all, the reservists. 300 thousand people would initially be called up under arms, according to the Russian Minister of Defense, Sergei Soigu, but they represent only a fraction of the total number of people who can be called up.
The Russian government press presented this decision as a pacifist step by Putin, who dreams, apparently, of peace, but is not supported by the West.
According to the false narratives of the Russian government media, specialists praise Putin for having managed to find a method of imposing peace on the territory of Ukraine - partial mobilization. In fact, political scientists from Moscow, close to or financed by the Kremlin regime, are cited, not specialists from other countries.
While US President Joe Biden accused Russia of violating the basic principles of membership of the United Nations by invading Ukraine and said that Moscow is making ""irresponsible"" threats with the use of nuclear weapons, the Russian press writes that Vladimir Putin is trying to prevent a nuclear disaster and to force the Ukrainians to sit down at the negotiating table.
In reality, partial or general mobilization cannot determine a de-escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. On the contrary, by sending new forces to the invaded territory, Russia practically escalates the conflict, and by threatening to use its nuclear arsenal, it also raises the stakes. It seems at least illogical the thesis launched in the Russian public space by a pro-Kremlin political scientist about ""de-escalation that will occur through escalation"". That is, in order to achieve peace, he will organize a big war. It is a logic that reminds, rather, from the one in the novel ""1984"", where the ministry in charge of war had been renamed the ""Ministry of Peace"".
It should be noted that the peace in Ukraine does not depend on the USA, but primarily on Russia, which invaded the neighboring state, destroyed localities, civilian targets, killed children, women and the elderly. The peace negotiations, analyzed in the Russian press, are actually discussions about possible territorial cessions or the capitulation of Ukraine. Ukraine has never issued territorial claims on Russia and neither has any NATO state, so all that Moscow should do, if it wants peace, would be to withdraw its forces from the invaded territories.
It is not clear how a nuclear disaster can be prevented with the help of a speech that includes direct threats. Putin clearly said in his speech that whoever threatens Russia with nuclear weapons will be attacked first. These discussions do not at all resemble elements of de-escalation, pacification and diplomatic process narratives, a fact also noticed by the international community.
According to British Foreign Minister Gillian Keegan, Vladimir Putin's speech indicates a worrying escalation. ""It's obviously an escalation,"" the British official said. And the EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy Josep Borrell said that Russia is again choosing the path of war.
In fact, the Russian press tries through these false narratives to justify the decision to order the partial mobilization in front of the public opinion.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that justified, starting on February 24, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. In March, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine wants to prolong the war and uses its citizens as human shields, while Russia protects Ukrainian civilians. In April, according to Russian government media, southern Ukraine was liberated by nationalists and wants to be annexed to Russia. To exonerate Russia in this war, Russian propaganda shows that the West is investigating the atrocities committed by Ukrainian nationalists while Putin is looking for solutions for peace in Ukraine.

The narrative was launched in the context in which the Ukrainian army found in the Izium area mass graves with the remains of hundreds of people, some with signs of summary executions, and chambers where civilians were tortured.
NEWS: ""Moscow is once again accused by the authorities in Kiev, who claim that the Russian military, the Russians, organized massacres and tortured the population in the Kharkiv region. It seems that in the territories that were controlled by Russia, Ukraine is preparing a new challenge similar to the one in Bucea - the presentation of the corpses of the victims of the occupation.
[...]
The head of the Kharkiv Regional Administration in the liberated territories, Vitali Gancev, informed that in the cities of Kupiansk and Veliki Burlik, occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, ""mercenaries walk around the towns and shoot people, everything is filmed"".,,I think they need to be cleaned these cities, then it will be shown to public opinion that the Russian military did this and that all the corpses were found on the streets"", informs RIA Novosti, quoting Vitali Gancev.

NARRATIVE: The Izium massacre is a staging designed to discredit Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: On September 12, two days after the liberation of the city of Izium, a local Ukrainian councilor stated that the Russian army would have killed over a thousand people in this town, and on September 15, Ukraine announced that it had discovered pits communes in the Kharkiv region; a day later, President Volodymyr Zelenski published images of the mass grave, writing that the people there are victims of the Russian occupation, including people with torture marks, bombing victims, children and soldiers. At the same time, representatives of the National Police of Ukraine said that at least 10 rooms were found in the liberated districts, in which civilians were tortured. There are dozens of witnesses to these atrocities.
The Russian press wrote, also on September 12, that a new staging of a massacre was being prepared, following the Bucea model. So, a few days before the official declarations of the representatives of Ukraine and the visit of the president of Ukraine to Izium, the Russian press was preparing the public opinion for an avalanche of accusations from Kiev and the states of the West.
A separatist leader from the Kharkiv region, self-proclaimed head of the Regional Administration, is quoted as saying that the Ukrainian military is shooting at civilians, therefore ""committing a massacre"", but the blame will be placed on Moscow. In other words, Russian propaganda has admitted with a few days before Kiev's announcement that a massacre had been committed, but attributed it to the Ukrainian military.
Also mentioned is Larisa Sesler, who represents the Union of Political Emigrants and Political Detainees from Ukraine - an organization founded on Russian territory by pro-Russian politicians who fled to Moscow. Sesler participates in anti-European and pro-Kremlin rallies on the territory of Ukraine, collaborating with the Kremlin.
The way the mass graves look and the condition of the bodies suggest that between the moment of burial and the moment when the Ukrainians announced the discovery of the mass graves, much more time passed than the maximum five days that had passed since the Russians had withdrawn from the region, which they had controlled for months.
Officials of the western states declared themselves shocked by the situation in Izium. The EU and the US have announced that they will support all Ukraine's efforts to punish those guilty of the atrocities in the Kharkiv region. The UN experts declared that they will visit the city of Izium, at the invitation of the Ukrainian side, to document the war crimes and verify the information about the torture of civilians. In the Kharkiv region, there are many journalists from abroad who reported from the spot about the mass graves and torture chambers during the occupation. In addition, Ukraine has opened an official investigation.
Finally, another argument against Russia is the fact that its soldiers committed numerous war crimes, documented including by international organizations, and the pro-Kremlin press tried to attribute them to the Ukrainians.
Veridica also dismantled a series of propaganda articles in this regard. In June, the pro-Kremlin press wrote that the Ukrainian army is massacring Russian speakers during the withdrawal from Donbass, and in July - that Volodymyr Zelenski will be tried for war crimes in Ukraine. When the international community was shocked by the atrocities of the Russian military in the Kiev region, the Russian press misinformed the readers/viewers, reporting about a group of American experts who demonstrated that the murders in Bucea were an invention of ""Ukrainian propaganda"". Then, the Russian press distributed another false narrative, writing that Ukraine invited experts from France who work to hide the evidence of war crimes committed by the Ukrainian army in Bucea.

Oleksii Reznikov's words were taken out of context. He spoke about a future multilateral peace agreement after the capitulation of Russia and a constructive dialogue with the West.
NEWS: The Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Oleksii Reznikov, said that the authorities in Kiev recently understood that they no longer have to trust the informal promises made by the Western partners. That is why, in order to reach peace in Ukraine, the authorities are ready to sign a multilateral document, which will contain certain security guarantees.
""I learned a lot, including learning not to trust various attempts to help us achieve peace in Ukraine. Unfortunately, in 2014 there were such attempts from our partners, but those instruments and those agreements that were proposed did not work"", said Reznikov.
[...] an example is the Budapest Memorandum, which deprived Ukraine of the status of third country in the world in terms of nuclear potential and did not offer the country the desired security.
 [...]
The press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Peskov, recently declared that Russia is ready and wants to resolve the situation in Ukraine diplomatically on the basis of its own conditions. Moscow and Kiev must discuss precisely the fulfillment of these conditions. At the same time, Peskov noted that Moscow's conditions remain the same. The final goal of the special operation, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is ""the liberation of Donbass and the creation of conditions that guarantee Russia's security"".
NARRATIVE: The government in Kiev expressed its lack of confidence in its partners from the West.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, during the interview given to the Ukrainian television station ICTV, the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Oleksii Reznikov, stated that he no longer trusts formal armistices or other agreements that do not provide real security guarantees. He said that ""the future act of Russia's capitulation must be a multilateral agreement that contains security guarantees from partners that Ukraine trusts"". The Russian media did not mention anything about Moscow's capitulation and took Reznikov's statement out of context. with the aim of manipulating public opinion.
Moreover, the Minister of Defense from Kiev declared on ICTV: ""We do not trust those who stood in front of us at the negotiations. Then I thought we could negotiate something with them"". The Minister of Defense was referring to the representatives of Russia, who participated in the peace negotiations regarding the situation in Donbass in the period 2014-2022. In Reznikov's statement, we do not find theses about distrust in the West, but we do find about ""the instruments or agreements that no longer work"".
Therefore, the news published by RIA Novosti and picked up by other government press agencies in Russia radically misrepresents the statements of the Ukrainian minister. As an amplification element, the argument about the Budapest Memorandum is used, which refers to the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine and provides security guarantees of its independence. Through this treaty, Ukraine gave up the Soviet nuclear weapons on its territory, which were transferred to the Russian Federation.
According to Russian propaganda, the Budapest Memorandum was proposed to Ukraine only by the West, which tricked Kiev. Nothing is said about the violation of this document by Russia in 2014.
It is worth mentioning that in August the MFA in Moscow mentioned that Russia did not violate the provisions of the Budapest Memorandum because the West bombed the former Yugoslavia, created the state of Kosovo, got involved in the political life of Ukraine in 2004, which means destroying the legal foundations of the agreement"". After the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, declared that the memorandum does not provide for any obligation of Russia to collaborate with an illegitimate regime in Kiev.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the West's destructive role in the war in Ukraine. The Russian government press wrote that terrorists are being trained on EU territory who will act against civilians in Donbass, the West is asking Kiev to yield to Moscow, while Ukrainian refugees are housed in former Nazi concentration camps.

In reality, the Government of Poland adopted a program of arming and increasing the number of soldiers in the context of the risk of the war in Ukraine extending over its territory.

[...]
In particular, the most ""ambitious"" armament program in the history of the country was adopted. The number of soldiers in the Polish army will reach 300 thousand for 10 years. It is also planned to purchase tanks, artillery, drones and so on far away.""
NARRATIVE: Poland will start a war against Russia in the next 10 years.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there is no statement from Poland's Deputy Defense Minister or any other Warsaw politician about planning a war against Russia. On the contrary, the government of Poland adopted a program of arming and increasing the number of soldiers in the context of the risk of the war in Ukraine expanding on its territory. In other words, Poland is preparing for a possible Russian aggression against it.
The Russian press took the statements of Poland's Deputy Minister of Defense out of context and intentionally presented them incorrectly in order to sow panic in Russian society and maintain a high level of support for the war in Ukraine, called by Russian propaganda a ""special military operation"".
The Deputy Minister of Defense of the Republic of Poland declared for ""Dziennik Gazeta Prawna"" that there is a serious risk of war with Russia in the next 3-10 years. He mentioned that war is much more expensive than investments in defense, this truth being demonstrated by the case of Ukraine. ""Our goal is to scare the enemy and show that it is not worth attacking Poland"", said Marcin Ocepa.
Therefore, the Polish official referred to a defense strategy, and not an offensive one, as the Russian press wrote. Marcin Ocepa declared that Russia could attack Poland even after the end of the war in Ukraine, after it reorganizes. ""We must use this time to arm the Polish army,"" said Ocepa.
After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Poland helped both Ukraine and the Ukrainian refugees on its territory. Right from the first days of the war, the leadership of Poland declared that Russia must be stopped now, because, otherwise, the war could expand. In September, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki declared that the EU must prepare for a possible extension of the war, because Moscow is dominated by the idea of ​​occupying other states. Therefore, the statements of the officials from the Ministry of Defense are in accordance with the defensive vision of the Polish leadership.
Veridica has already written about a series of false narratives regarding Poland, according to which President Duda admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories, and Kiev would have allowed 10,000 soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country. In July, the Russian press wrote that Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to seize a part of Ukraine. Publication / Media:

All these localities were the target of Russian aggression and bombardment, and the majority of Ukrainians - including the inhabitants of the Zaporizhia region - consider Russia an enemy.
NEWS: ""We are together with Russia"" movement representative, member of the main committee of the Zaporozhye Region Administration Council, Vladimir Rogov, hopes that the regional centers of Zaporozhye, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa will be liberated from the Ukrainian Nazis.
The advisor to the Zelenski administration, Mihailo Podoliak, asked the residents of the ""occupied"" territories, including Crimea, to prepare for the ""liberation"" process.

If someone has to prepare for liberation and vacating, then we are talking about the residents of Mykolaiv, Zaporozhye, Kharkiv and Odessa.

In the special operation, the Russian military took control over the territory of the Sea of ​​Azov area of ​​the Zaporizhia region and the entire Kherson region, entering large cities such as Kherson, Melitopol and Berdiansk and leaving Ukraine without access to the Sea of ​​Azov. New administrations were created in both regions, Russian television and radio stations are broadcast, trade and transport links with Crimea are restored. The regions have declared that they want to be joined to Russia"".
NARRATIVE: The inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region are waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Vladimir Rogov, mentioned by the Russian press as a member of the Zaporozhye Region Administration Council - only partially controlled by the Russian military - is a representative of the Russian bodies in the occupied area of ​​the region. Rogov fled to Russia in 2014, after speaking out against Euromaidan, supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass, and in 2022 he was appointed Moscow's representative in the Zaporizhia region.
In July, the EU adopted sanctions against Vladimir Rogov for supporting or carrying out ""actions that undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, the stability or security of Ukraine"".
The Russian press, especially RIA Novosti and government television stations, often ask Rogov for interviews, most of which are also published on his Telegram channel. In these interviews, Rogor speaks on behalf of all the inhabitants of the Zaporizhia region, including those in the territories controlled by Kiev. Rogov popularizes Russian propaganda narratives, saying that the Ukrainian Nazis are oppressing the cities of Odessa, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, and the residents are just waiting to be liberated by Russia. Moreover, the Russian press adds, without any proof, that ""the regions have declared that they want to be joined to Russia"", preparing public opinion for the eventual holding of some ""referendums"" on joining.
In reality, the inhabitants of the regions listed by RIA Novosti oppose a strong resistance to Russian aggression. Since the beginning of the war, unarmed people stopped Russian tanks, went out to protests, shattering the Kremlin's illusions about pro-Russian attitudes in Donbass. According to a survey carried out in August last year, 81% of Ukrainians declared that the Russians are the enemies of Ukrainians. Over 90% of respondents were hostile to Russia.
In protest against Moscow's aggression, many Ukrainians in the east of the country have given up speaking Russian, switching to Ukrainian, according to a survey published in August.
The ""liberation"" requested by Rogov is, in fact, a claim of the territories of a sovereign state by the neighboring state through destruction, bombings and the killing of civilians. The narratives about ""liberation"" and ""annexation"" are increasingly distributed by the Russian media starting with July 20, when the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, declared that Moscow is expanding its ""special operation"" in Ukraine to the southern regions.
The data on the ground and the situation on the front show that the residents of the regions in the south-east of Ukraine do not expect any liberation from Russia, but a withdrawal of the occupation troops from their territory.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Veridica has debunked a series of false narratives regarding the situation in the Zaporozhye region. In April, the Russian press wrote that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporizhia are requesting to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. In May, Vladimir Rogov, quoted by Russian government press agencies, said that Ukraine is preparing to cede the city of Zaporozhye, and in June the Russian press wrote that volunteers from Zaporozhye are joining a battalion that will defend the region from the aggression of the Ukrainian army . In August, Rogov boasted that Zaporozhye had established contacts with at least 15 states, including EU members. Publication / Media:

The State Duma of the Russian Federation asked the IAEA to pressure Ukraine to stop bombing the plant, according to Dni.ru. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, declared that he managed to see the ""key elements"", RT writes.
NARRATIVE: The IAEA mission praised the Russian army for defending the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant from Ukrainian bombings.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there is no official position of the International Atomic Energy Agency in which the role of the Russian military is emphasized, which ""protects the nuclear plant from the bombings of the Ukrainian side"". This would mean the recognition of the legitimacy of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which is not within the competence of the IAEA.
The information in the Russian press is based on a statement by the separatist leader, Evgheni Balitki, self-proclaimed head of the Zaporizhia State Military Regional Administration. He represents the Kremlin in the localities occupied by Russian troops. Therefore, it is not a statement of legitimate Ukrainian officials. Russian propaganda intentionally uses names of occupation bodies similar to those of legal Ukrainian institutions in order to mislead public opinion.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) considers Balitki a collaborator of Russia, which initiated after February 24 of this year. the creation of civilian detachments with the aim of persecuting Ukrainians who have spoken out against the Russian authorities in the past. Evgheni Balitki was a member of the Party of Regions of the pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych and of the Opposition Platform, banned on the territory of Ukraine during martial law.
The Russian press only quotes Balitki, without providing links to other sources, repeating classic propaganda narratives about Russia's rescue of the Zaporizhia plant, which is ""systematically bombarded by the Ukrainian army"".
At the time of publication of the news on URA.RU, the International Atomic Energy Agency had not published any official report on the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. In other words, it is about a false narrative of the Russian media, based only on some statements of the separatist leaders.
The majority of the IAEA delegation left the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant on September 5, as planned, after several days of essential safety-related activity. Two experts remained part of the constant presence at the plant, according to the IAEA.
It should be noted that the IAEA mission arrived in Zaporozhye at the request of Kiev, and not Moscow. The Ukrainian government requested that the IAEA technicians perform a nuclear engineering audit at the Zaporozhye plant and not just inspection and surveillance tasks, as they have done until now.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. In August, the Russian press wrote that at the behest of the US, Kiev would cause a nuclear disaster in Zaporozhye, following another false narrative, according to which an explosion would be caused to hide the traces of American biological weapons laboratories.

The so-called news is a fabrication: there is no statement by Anthony Fauci regarding the production of viruses or other biological weapons in Ukraine.
NEWS: ""Chief epidemiologist Anthony Fauci resigned and started giving candid interviews. He admitted that American scientists worked on the production of the COVID-19 virus not only in Wuhan, China, but also in several biological laboratories in Ukraine, reports Fox News.
Asked why so many special laboratories were opened in Ukraine, Fauci said that ""very necessary experiments were carried out in the interest of US national security"".
""Laboratories are extremely dangerous and it is forbidden by law for anyone to operate them on the territory of the United States. We paid good money to the Ukrainians, they were happy,"" he said.
[...]
""It was not difficult to convince Kiev, we managed to open several laboratories even in China, especially in Wuhan. The Chinese only knew about some relatively safe activities, but not about all. The Ukrainians, on the other hand, had no idea about most of our experiments,"" he said.
In March, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that there were biological laboratories operating on the territory of Ukraine that used pathogenic agents of dangerous infections, as part of joint programs with the Pentagon.
NARRATIVE: An American epidemiologist confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was produced in laboratories in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Anthony Fauci did not say on Fox News that the US produced the COVID-19 virus in biological laboratories in Ukraine. Russia News, publishing this news, quotes an article from Fox News, but without a hyperlink. Only a screenshot is presented so that readers cannot verify the source.
In the article of the American television station, we do not find anywhere Fauci's statement, quoted by the Russian press, from which it can be concluded that the USA financed biological laboratories for the production of COVID-19 in Ukraine. The article only claims that Fauci may know more about the origin of COVID-19, but does not include statements from this epidemiologist.
In another article, American scientists were accused by a journalist of conducting experiments in Ukrainian laboratories and of working on COVID-19. The article appears in the ""Opinion"" column, the author does not provide any evidence, the theses being assumptions of the journalist, and in no way statements by Anthony Fauci, as the Russian press writes. The American magazine Science reacted to the Fox News editorial, calling the article a false narrative.
In other words, Fox News did not publish any statement by epidemiologist Anthony Fauci about biological laboratories in Ukraine where viruses were produced; Veridica has not identified any other source in which such a statement appears.
The history of this false narrative is older and since 2020 the US embassy in Kiev has reacted to it by stating that there is no American secret laboratory on the territory of Ukraine.
Later, in order to justify the invasion of Ukraine, Russian journalists reported about the biological laboratories, created and financed by the USA in Ukraine, where experiments were carried out based on the bat coronavirus. These propaganda messages are an attempt to wake up a wave of hatred of Russians towards Ukraine and the West, which, apparently, brought COVID-19 to their country, being a casus belli found post-factum by the Kremlin.
At the beginning of the invasion, Kremlin spokesmen declared that Russia had destroyed American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. In April, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine attacked Russian military positions with chemical and biological weapons, using military drones. In May, another false narrative was distributed, according to which the EU is afraid of tuberculosis originating from NATO laboratories in Ukraine. Recently, the Russian government media convinced the public that the US will cause a nuclear disaster in Ukraine to hide the traces of biological weapons laboratories. Publication / Media:

In reality, practically nothing has changed in Chisinau in recent years regarding the status of the Russian language - Romanian speakers are often forced to switch to Russian when communicating with Russian speakers, cinemas broadcast movies dubbed in Russian, and TV channels, shows and Russian films abound in the audio-visual space.
NEWS: ""Russian language and literature, integral parts of Moldovan society, have been under pressure in recent years, at the initiative of Maia Sandu""
[...] ""There are only two cinemas left in Chisinau, which broadcast Western movies and cartoons. The decline was also partially caused by the pro-European authorities who imposed language barriers for Russian films and for the dubbing of Western films in Russian""
[...] ""On June 22, the Law on the protection of the local informational space entered into force. Broadcasting of news, analytical programs and films with military content from Russia is prohibited. Nobody cares that by banning Russian TV programs, the government of the Republic of Moldova violates point 2 of art. 13 of the Constitution which provides that ""the State recognizes and protects the right to preserve, develop and function the Russian language and other languages ​​spoken on the territory of the country."" NARRATIVE: The government in Chisinau undermines the role of the Russian language and violates the rights of national minorities.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is an ex-Soviet country in which the Russian language had a predominant status during the former USSR, being the language of the communist elites and the artificially increased minorities, especially Russians and Ukrainians.
According to the legislation adopted at the end of the Soviet period, the Russian language has the role of the language of interethnic communication. But the law was declared obsolete (obsolete) by the Constitutional Court. Meanwhile, the share of national minorities decreased, and according to the 2014 census, 82% of the population declared themselves Moldovan/Romanian (in 2004, 78% declared themselves Moldovan/Romanian), followed by Ukrainians - 6.6%, Gagauzians - 4 .6% and Russians - 4.4%.
Although the share of Russian-speaking minorities is decreasing, there are still politicians and parties that try to use minorities for electoral purposes, by promoting topics such as the declaration of the Russian language as the second ""state"" language.
Also, the messages from the Russian press about the alleged violation of the rights of the Russian-speaking minorities and the accusations against the government in Chisinau, being directly or indirectly compared to the one in Kiev, which the Kremlin accuses of ""Nazification"", have intensified.
The article from rubaltic.ru starts from a subject that, apparently, has nothing to do with politics - the deplorable state Moldovan cinema has reached and the disappearance of the Moldova Film studio (which belonged to Soviet cinema) after the collapse of the USSR. From the praises brought to the Soviet cinema, the author moves on to the unfounded statements related to the status of the Russian language.
OBJECTIVE: To present the Chisinau government as hostile to the Russian-speaking minorities of the Republic of Moldova.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The minorities in the Republic of Moldova continue to use the Russian language, without any impediment from the authorities; on the contrary, the Russian language can be heard frequently in the cities of the Republic of Moldova and is used even by native Romanian speakers when they interact with native Russian speakers. The cinemas that the author of the article is talking about still broadcast films dubbed in Russian or with Romanian subtitles. The Russian language is still studied in Romanian-language schools; moreover, about 16% of schools are taught in Russian, which corresponds to the share of national minorities, so that there can be no question of violating the right to education in Russian.
Finally, the law referred to does not prohibit the retransmission of TV stations from Russia. This does not allow the retransmission of certain categories of programs such as news and political shows produced in states that have not ratified the European Convention on cross-border television. The purpose of the law is to prevent manipulation, disinformation and propaganda disseminated by Russian media institutions, the overwhelming majority of which are controlled by the Kremlin and which have intensified with the Russian military intervention in Ukraine.

NEWS: ""A training center for saboteurs for operations in Donbass was created in the EU. The Czech authorities have created on their territory a training center for saboteurs and terrorists who will act against civilians in Donbass, the first deputy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Donetsk People's Republic, Serghei Pereseda, told journalists on Tuesday.

NARRATIVE: Terrorists are being trained on EU territory who will act against civilians in Donbass.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The EU has no training centers for saboteurs and mercenaries on its territory who will organize terrorist attacks against civilians in Donbass. EU member states have been involved in a series of international initiatives to combat terrorism. In June this year The European Council adopted conclusions on protection against terrorism. The Council invited member states to continue the exchange of information on foreign terrorist fighters and invited authorities to issue entry bans for third-country nationals who pose a threat to national security. So, legislatively, ideologically and from the point of view of the European values ​​assumed by the member states, the training of terrorists cannot take place in the EU.
Through this propaganda narrative, the Russian press is actually reacting to an announcement that the EU could prepare the Ukrainian military to use the new types of weaponry they receive from the West. The High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, said that the EU could create a training mission for the Ukrainian military, but the decision will be taken after the meeting of the European Defense Ministers in Prague. The head of European diplomacy emphasized that the mission could work alongside the common training centers, which are, among others, in the Czech Republic.
In addition, there is a diplomatic scandal between Russia and the Czech Republic after a statement by the Czech Foreign Minister, Jana Cernochova, about the murder of Daria Dughina, the daughter of the Russian geopolitician Aleksandr Dughin. She said that she primarily regrets the thousands of civilians killed by the Dughinist ideology. The representative of Russia at the UN accused Jana Cernochova of ""supporting terrorism"". In addition, in June the Czech Republic announced that it would support the designation of Russia as a terrorist state. In response, the Russian media launched a series of disinformation narratives regarding the foreign policy of the Czech Republic.
Speaking about the Ukrainian Evheni Karpenko, who, apparently, was preparing a terrorist act, the Russian media does not provide any evidence. It is a terrorism present only in the Russian media, not on the ground.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the support of ""extremists"" and ""Nazis"" in Ukraine by the EU. In April, the Russian press wrote that the French gendarmes will hide the traces of the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea, and in June - that the EU will deport refugee men to Ukraine to be enlisted in the Ukrainian army. Starting with February 24 a.c. Russian propaganda reported weekly about Ukrainian Nazis and terrorists killing Russian-speaking civilians with the support of the West. Publication / Media:

""Ukrainians must liberate Ukraine. Well, they themselves will not be able to under the conditions of the fascist regime. Of course, this is possible together with allies,"" said Mykola Azarov, ex-prime minister of Ukraine.""
NARRATIVE: Due to Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, and not occupied.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The website Ukraina.ru, which is part of the government media trust Russia Today, accuses the Ukrainian authorities of having ""worked"" the population for 8 years with the help of disinformation and neo-Nazi propaganda, and from this because the Ukrainians are not able to understand that Russia came to liberate them, not to occupy them. To give more credibility to this narrative in the eyes of the Russian public opinion, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov is quoted.
Azarov has been on the territory of Russia since 2014 and has been engaged for years in an effort to discredit the Ukrainian authorities in the Russian and Ukrainian press. In March 2021, the Security and National Defense Council of Ukraine introduced sanctions against Mykola Azarov. The former Ukrainian Prime Minister, who led the most pro-Russian Government in the history of Ukraine, is accused of having the citizenship of the aggressor state (Russia) and promoted during the interviews given various anti-Ukrainian theses about Ukrainian ""Nazism"" and the transformation of the country into a colony of the West. He did not appear at the court hearings in which he was accused of taking bribes in large proportions, tax evasion and launching calls in 2015 for a coup d'état in Ukraine, which would bring to power pro- Therefore, Azarov transmits the messages of the Kremlin in the press, totally dependent on the Russian political elite.
Azarov's statements are based on the metanarrative ""Ukraine is a Nazi state"" built over the last years by the Russian media. This has been used, moreover, since 2014 to justify Russia's aggression in Ukraine.
In July 2015, Ukraine banned by law any public display of communist and Nazi ideology, so the claim that Nazi propaganda is made is meaningless.
Russia's actions in Ukraine after February 24 a.c. they cannot in any case be called liberation, being an unprovoked aggression against an independent state - a continuation of the annexation of Crimea and the support of separatist movements in Donbass; the conflict shows the characteristics of an imperial war of conquest. 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine and that it is a terrorist state. Publication / Media:

It is possible that in this way they want to hide under the umbrella of pollution the traces of the activity of biological weapons laboratories or they simply want to destroy a part of the Russian world"".
NARRATIVE: The US will cause a nuclear disaster in Ukraine to hide the traces of biological weapons laboratories.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: An explosion at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe can have a global impact, on the principle of the domino effect, given that the radioactive cloud affects a large territory. Depending on the atmospheric conditions and the extent of the explosion, it is possible that all countries will be affected, including the USA, even if, according to the Russian media, ""it is on the other side of the ocean"". Moreover, there are precedents: the Chernobyl nuclear disaster - a plant smaller than Zaporizhia - created a radioactive cloud that affected the entire northern hemisphere and a total of three billion people. The accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant had a slightly smaller global impact, but it led to a rethink in the whole world of the role of nuclear power plants and had long-term effects on energy markets.
The USA has repeatedly asked Russia to stop the destabilizing actions in the perimeter of the plant, which put the future of humanity in danger. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken qualified the actions of the Russian army as ""the height of irresponsibility"".
The position of the USA and other Western countries, interested in ensuring nuclear security around the world, was presented in 2016 at the UN, when a resolution was adopted, according to which the international community undertakes never to repeat the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which took place on the territory of Ukraine on April 26, 1986. Any nuclear disaster will bring damage to the whole world, and not just to a separate state, according to the resolution.
The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has repeatedly demanded that Russian forces leave the perimeter of the nuclear power plant in Zaporozhye, which they took under their control in March, shortly after the start of the invasion on February 24. The UN has also launched a call for the demilitarization of the central area.
On the other hand, Russia accuses Ukraine of bombing the plant, and the Russian government press writes that it is doing it at the behest of the West. ""It does not occur to anyone that Ukraine could strike its own nuclear power plant, creating an enormous risk of a nuclear catastrophe on its own territory,"" said the Ukrainian ambassador to the UN, Sergey Kislita. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of regarding the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant
At the same time, the Russian press returns to the topic of biological weapons laboratories on the territory of Ukraine. This time the two false narratives, which were distributed separately from each other in the last 6 months, were merged into a single metanarrative.
In reality, there were no US-funded biological weapons production laboratories in Ukraine. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons. Despite this fact, in recent years the Russian press has drawn the attention of public opinion in the post-Soviet states to some American-Ukrainian projects in the field of biological research. The agreement between Ukraine and the USA in this field is presented by the Russian media as an element of the production of biological weapons. In reality, such collaboration agreements also exist in the case of other post-Soviet states, and until 2012 the USA also cooperated with Russia in this field. The history of this false narrative is older and since 2020 the US embassy in Kiev has reacted to it by stating that there is no American secret laboratory on the territory of Ukraine.
So far, Moscow has not presented any concrete evidence that there was any laboratory for the production of biological weapons in Ukraine. The topic of biological laboratories was used by the Russian press as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine. Often, the bombing of Ukrainian cities was presented as an attempt to destroy American laboratories.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news on this topic. In March, the Russian press wrote that the coronavirus was produced in secret laboratories in Ukraine. At the beginning of the invasion, Kremlin spokesmen declared that Russia had destroyed American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. In April, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine attacked Russian military positions with chemical and biological weapons, using military drones. In May, another false narrative was distributed, according to which the EU is afraid of tuberculosis originating from NATO laboratories in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

The article was published before the cause of death was known or if the young woman was vaccinated or not.
NEWS: ""Basketball player Alessia Maria Raiciu died suddenly, on Monday, on the day she turned 18, announced the Romanian Basketball Federation, quoted by StiripeSource. ""The flight of a basketball player with a real perspective was ended much too early... One of the most talented athletes of the 2004 generation is no longer with us.

The young woman was found dead at home yesterday. It seems that the athlete had a suspicious death. For now, the cause of death is unknown, but investigations are being carried out in this case""
NARRATIVE: Vaccination against the coronavirus causes death even among young people.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Ever since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a series of false narratives have appeared in Romania regarding its nature and origin, the measures taken to combat its spread, the effectiveness and effects of vaccination. Among those who promoted these false narratives regarding SARS-CoV-2 are adherents of various conspiracy theories, people who emphasize a radical orthodoxy and support those prelates who also contested the anti-Covid measures (the exponent who the most important of them being the archbishop of Tomis, Teodosie), representatives of the Coalition for the Family, sovereignists, Euro-skeptics, anti-Westerners, followers of protochronism, people who over time promoted Russia's messages in Romania and/or were promoted intensively by the spokeswoman of the Kremlin, Sputnik.
In the context of the increase in cases of infection with COVID-19 this month in Romania and the official recommendations to wear a mask again in crowded spaces, conspiracy sites in Romania, such as Activenews.ro, continue the series of fake news and disinformation about to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In support of the serious claims, the portal does not present any medical evidence. I put the lack of evidence on the back of the ""omerta"" in the medical field regarding the deaths allegedly caused by the vaccine against COVID-19.
Also, Activenews.ro seeks to validate its conspiracy theories through pseudo-experts and anonymous websites or through the truncated amount of information from various studies.
Veridica has already dismantled several fake news and misinformation about the anti-Covid vaccine - that it would cause sterility for three (sic!) generations, that it would affect the performance of tennis player Simona Halep at the Australian Open, or that it would not be effective and would have serious adverse effects. The last two also appeared on ActiveNews, a portal that also published numerous articles in which the death of some people was attributed to vaccination.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the anti-vaccine culture and inducing fear among those who get vaccinated against COVID-19 or who would intend to get vaccinated.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: Without having any evidence in this regard, the author of the article induces from the title the idea that the athlete's death would have occurred due to the vaccination against COVID-19.
In reality, it was not known until the publication date of the article, August 15, whether the young woman was vaccinated against COVID-19, nor the exact cause of death.
The first information in this regard came only on August 16, after lunch, when the president of the Romanian Basketball Federation, Carmen Tocala, declared on Antena 3 that the athlete died in her sleep on Sunday morning, when she was found breathless in her apartment, without signs of violence on her body.
The cause of death officially established by doctors is acute pulmonary edema. For now, the causes are unknown and the results of the anatomo-pathology and toxicology examinations are awaited.
Pulmonary edema is a condition caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary interstitium and alveolar space with extravasation of fluid and its reabsorption through the lymphatic channels. As a result of this accumulation of liquid in the lung, the alveolo-capillary exchange surface is altered and thus the oxygen saturation in the peripheral blood decreases, according to the description on the Medicover clinic website.
""Most frequently, sudden death can be myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or major rhythm disorder. Not all these pre-existing conditions can be observed in the routine investigations that are done for athletes, but they can be latent or occult, which is why you can end up in this unfortunate situation of sudden death"", said sports doctor Pompiliu Popescu on Antena 3 .

NEWS: ""The former adviser to the head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell, Nathalie Tocci, believes that some of the countries of the European Union will gradually move to Russia's side and will ask Ukraine to make concessions to Moscow, Foreign Affairs writes.

She also stated that the reason for the division within the EU on the topic of supporting the Ukrainian authorities in the special operation will be the possible completion of the active phase of hostilities. This can happen with a high probability if the energy crisis in Europe starts to deepen, said Tocci"".
NARRATIVE: The EU states will ask Ukraine to surrender to Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The statements of the former adviser to the head of European diplomacy were taken out of context and presented intentionally wrongly by the Russian media in order to convince the public opinion that the ""special military operation"" is being carried out successfully, and the EU states will step by step pass on the side of Moscow.
In reality, Nathalie Tocci did not write that the EU will ask Kiev to give in. On the contrary, her message was one of encouraging European solidarity to stop Russian aggression. It is worth mentioning that the Russian press does not cite the article via hyperlink, but publishes links to the home page of Foreign Affairs magazine.
Nathalie Tocci writes in the article, Will Russia succeed in dividing Europe? ""Why a false peace can be worse than a long war"" that the EU must not go against Russia, so it must not give in. The conclusion of Borell's former adviser is the opposite of the one presented by the Russian press. Nathalie Tocci writes that during truce, the EU must double its support for Kiev, ""not only to guarantee that Russia will be defeated, but to make possible Ukraine's victory in the war"". Tocci does not ask the European leaders to cooperate with Russia or to pressure Kiev to give in to Moscow.
She admits that the EU could become much more divided in the context of the energy crisis, adding that a fake peace with Russia will be worse than a good war. Tocci emphasizes that the EU's renunciation of support for Ukraine can generate a wave of nationalism and populism in the EU. ""If nationalist Europe is possible, nationalist EU is terminological nonsense,"" according to the article published by Foreign Affairs.
Therefore, Nathalie Tocci did not write that the EU states will ask Kiev to yield to Russia. It should be noted that the Russian press emphasized the past function of the Italian specialist in EU structures, without mentioning that Tocci signed the article as director of the Institute of International Relations in Rome, and her opinion does not represent the position of some EU member states.

In reality, against the background of the country's depopulation and traffic restrictions, criminality has decreased. In addition, not even the entire population was armed, but only some volunteer units were formed.
NEWS: ""Since May, the level of criminality in Ukraine has increased, informs the press service of the Ministry of Interior [...] the rate of intentional homicides increased for half a year by over 9% (compared to 2021), and the number of thefts vehicles increased by 86% compared to the same period.

The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs prepared last week [also] a report to the Zelensky Administration regarding the increase in criminality in Ukraine. So, in the report, the increase in the number of crimes is 270%. Due to the lack of personnel and a large number of weapons provided to civilians, the number of serious crimes has increased in Ukraine, primarily - murders and robberies"".
NARRATIVE: The level of criminality in Ukraine increased three times following Kiev's decision to arm civilians.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The news about crime in Ukraine can also be found on the Ukraina.ru portal, which is part of the government media trust Russia Today. Russian journalists cite sources of the Resident Telegram channel, who claim that the president of Ukraine was informed by the Ukrainian interior minister that the level of crime in Ukraine has increased by 270%. In reality, the information presented by the Russian press does not coincide with the official information of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. There is no report at the level of the Government in Kiev that confirms that the level of criminality has increased so much.
According to the Security Service of Ukraine, the Rezident Telegram channel is coordinated by the Kremlin with the aim of misinforming the public opinion in Russia and destabilizing the situation in Ukrainian society. In 2021, several Russian agents were arrested participating in the distribution of information on this Telegram channel on the territory of Ukraine.
In fact, the official report of the Ministry of Interior of Ukraine, carried out by the Department of Criminal Investigation, shows that the level of criminality has decreased on the territory of Ukraine by 25% in the last 6 months. Moreover, there are fewer and fewer cases of theft and robbery, with the exception of the areas occupied by Russia or those in the conflict zone.
The reduction in the level of criminality on the territory of Ukraine has logical explanations. According to the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine, many Ukrainians (about 9 million) took refuge in other countries. Also, the decrease in the level of criminality is due to the traffic ban for citizens at night. The reduction in the number of the population and the contacts between the citizens remaining in Ukraine determined the decrease, and not the increase, in the level of criminality.
At the same time, according to the National Police, the 9% increase in the level of homicides on the territory of Ukraine was recorded in the combat zones, and most of these cases refer to the crimes of the Russian military. The Ukrainian authorities add that weapons arrive as trophies from the battle zones to the territories near the front, which represents risks for the security of civilians.
The Russian government press manipulates public opinion, writing that every civilian has access to weapons. In reality, only the civilians enrolled in the territorial defense units, which in April were included in the general defense system of the Ukrainian state, are armed. The number of volunteers of the territorial defense units is known, there is a registry at the level of the Ukrainian government.
OBJECTIVE: The false narrative aims to demonstrate to public opinion in Russia and in the Ukrainian territories occupied by the Russian military that Ukraine can no longer manage to maintain public order, cannot block organized crime groups, while in the areas controlled by Moscow the situation is under control.

The narrative was launched after Romanian soldiers killed in the Second World War were commemorated in a town in the Republic of Moldova.
NEWS: Let's imagine for a second that Nazism would have been defeated in the Second World War. Hitler would have been everything for us, and communism and the Jews - the world evil, and the Romanians in Moldova, excuse me, in Bessarabia would have been the lords, the ""superior race"" and masters. The maximum that our current political class could hope for would be he had attended two or three classes in the church school, so that he could sign, write denunciations and count the cows. Why would the ""herd"" who had to take care of the cows and rams need quality education? In order to stand at the tail of the cow, it is enough to count to 100 and to be able to read the orders of the ""gentlemen"". And we would have had no schools, no universities, no Academy of Sciences. NARRATIVE: If the Republic of Moldova had been part of Romania, it would have been an underdeveloped region, with an illiterate population enslaved by Romanians.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the Republic of Moldova, several cemeteries or monuments dedicated to Romanian soldiers who fought in the Second World War were rehabilitated or built, actions that were criticized by some politicians or the Russian media and/or pro - the Russian, who qualifies them as signs of a revival of fascism. Criticism was accompanied by the resumption of narratives first used by Soviet propaganda.
In Soviet historiography, literature and cinematography, the Romanian soldiers who fought in the Second World War were presented as fascists who destroyed the local population, this narrative being a continuation of a similar one that appeared immediately after 1918 about the ""Romanian gendarme"" who beat the Bessarabians after the union of Bessarabia with Romania. Likewise, the period between 1918-1940, after the union of Bessarabia with Romania, is considered by the respective sources as an occupation, in accordance with the theses of Moldavianism regarding the existence of two different languages ​​and peoples.
OBJECTIVE: To bring back to the collective memory the associations promoted during the Soviet period between Romania/Romanians and fascism and to praise the Soviet period.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The union of Bessarabia with Romania was first decided in Chisinau, being voted by the Council of the Country, in the context in which, against the background of the collapse of the Tsarist Empire and the civil war, the territory between the Prut and the Dniester was in danger, so it was not a matter of a ""Romanian occupation"". It should be noted that the respective territory had not voluntarily united with the Tsarist Empire, which had captured it during its expansion to the west. In the Tsarist Empire, Bessarabia was treated as a remote, underdeveloped governorate, with the local (Romanian) population concentrated in the rural area. The phenomenon did not disappear after Bessarabia was captured by the USSR, when the Romanian population was the target of large-scale persecution (mass deportations, arrests, executions). Both during the Tsarist period and and in the Soviet one, the elites of the province were at best Russified, when they were not directly brought in. Moreover, the territory that had represented Bessarabia in the SSR was kept as a predominantly agricultural area, industrial development being reserved for Transnistria. Considering all these arguments, it can be said that underdevelopment is a phenomenon associated rather with the Tsarist and Soviet occupation.
After the collapse of the USSR, Romania became the country that invested the most in the education of young people in the Republic of Moldova. Annually, it offers places in its universities and high schools for young people from the Republic of Moldova, offering them larger scholarships than those in the Republic of Moldova. As part of a grant agreement offered to the Republic of Moldova, Romania repaired over 900 kindergartens and invested in the repair and expansion of the ""Mihai Eminescu"" High School in Comrat, the capital of the Gagauz Autonomous Region, a Russophile region.
In order to have an indication of what the level of development of the territory between the Prut and Dniester would have been if it had continued from Romania, we can look at its degree of development. Romania's GDP per capita, for example, is more than twice that of the Republic of Moldova and has also surpassed that of the Russian Federation.
It should be noted, however, that such exercises of alternative history are futile, being used in this case for strictly propagandistic purposes.
TRUTH: Romania was, indeed, allied with Nazi Germany during the war fought by it with the Soviet Union, which broke out almost two years after the two totalitarian states had started the Second World War by attacking Poland. Throughout the years in which it was allied with Germany, before turning its weapons against it, Romania had a leadership that adopted policies and a speech similar to that of Berlin, both in terms of the position towards communism, and and the one against the Jews; moreover, through the gendarmerie, the army and its administration, the Romanian state participated in the Holocaust. Communists and Jews from Bessarabia were victims of the Romanian state. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: The UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control Ukraine's seaports.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The agreements signed in Istanbul do not mention any takeover of control over Ukrainian ports and maritime communications by Russia. These agreements were signed on July 22 by the representatives of Russia and Ukraine, with the Turkish president and the UN secretary general acting as intermediaries.
It is about 2 different agreements: one refers to the unblocking of Russian agricultural exports and the other - to the unblocking of Ukrainian agricultural exports.
Ukraine has complained in front of international forums that Russia is blocking its ports, being forced to close them due to permanent bombings. Until the invasion, 80-90% of Ukrainian grain exports were carried out through sea ports. Less than 24 hours after the signing in Istanbul of the agreement that would allow, according to estimates, the export of 20 million tons of Ukrainian grain, Moscow sent cruise missiles on the grain installations in the port of Odesa.
President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of not fulfilling its commitments under the agreements, stating that grain exports depend only on Moscow and the cessation of the bombing by the Russian army of Ukrainian ports. The representative of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andrij Sybiha, accused Russia of violating the agreements, which prohibit the bombing of ports.
Instead, the Russian press quotes the expert Anatolii Sarii, who fled from Ukraine until the invasion of February 24 BC. and who is accused by the SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) of distributing Russian propaganda and collaborating with the Kremlin. Over the last few years, Sarii's blog has become quite popular in Ukraine, and his party has created groups in various local councils. Anatolii Sarii is accused of treason. The Russian press continues to present him as an independent Ukrainian expert. He called the Istanbul agreements ""terrifying for Kiev"" and emphasized that the UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control the Black Sea, but they do not show where in the signed documents it is said about this.
In fact, any unilateral control of a state over the ports or communications of another state cannot be decided by any international organization, including the UN. Ukraine has the right to control its territorial waters and seaports. Russia's occupation of some Ukrainian territories does not mean the emergence of its right to control seaports, given that military aggression is not considered a method of legitimizing territorial control.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of Russia that aim to convince public opinion that states and international organizations recognize its right to occupy various territories of Ukraine. In June, the Russian press wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace. Also, in April, the Russian government press wrote that Vladimir Putin convinced the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, that the Ukrainian Nazis should be tried at the International Criminal Court. The Russian press also tried to convince the public opinion that the UN supports the genocide directed against the Russian speakers in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

In reality, Russia is placing weapons and military equipment on the territory of the plant, endangering the nuclear security of Europe.
NEWS: ""The bombing of the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant by the Ukrainian military could cause a nuclear disaster. According to the deputy director of the Department of Information and Printing of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Ivan Neciaev, Kiev does this consciously.
He emphasized that the nuclear disaster of large proportions is in the interest of the USA and its allies. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine are bombarding with a maniacal insistence the largest nuclear power plant in Europe - Zaporozhye NPP, without thinking about the consequences, violating the resolution and decisions of the IAEA general conference"".
[...]
Previously, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia expressed its concern about the escalation by Kiev of the situation around the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. In the comment distributed by the ministry, it is said that the Russian Federation has been warning the Ukrainian authorities not to continue the provocations towards the nuclear power plant because an industrial disaster can be caused.
It is emphasized that Russia has a ""very responsible behavior towards the nuclear targets in Ukraine"" and is doing everything possible to ensure their security.
NARRATIVE: Kiev will cause a nuclear disaster in Zaporozhye at the behest of the US.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was occupied by the Russian military on March 4th. The Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly accused Russia of turning the plant into a ""military base"".
The Ukrainian company ""Energoatom"" communicated in July of this year that the Russian military brought at least 14 units of military equipment (missile launchers, tanks, armored cars, etc.) to the territory of the nuclear power plant. The nuclear objective is used as a shield for the Russian military, which they are aware of the fact that Ukraine will not risk shooting at the plant.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared on August 1 that the Russian troops are bombing the Ukrainian army from the positions near the nuclear power plant, confirming the information of the Ukrainian authorities. He qualified this ""tactic"" as ""the height of irresponsibility"". ""Of course, the Ukrainians cannot pull back without risking a terrible accident involving the nuclear power plant,"" Blinken told reporters after the end of the UN discussions on nuclear non-proliferation in New York.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly asked Russia not to carry out military actions near nuclear power plants. The Director of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, warned about the fact that the situation at the Zaporozhye plant in Ukraine, which is under Russian control, is increasingly dangerous and insisted that it is necessary to allow access to the agency's experts in order to avoid a tragedy.
According to the State Inspection for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine, the IAEA mission cannot visit the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant for security reasons. ""As long as the plant is occupied by Russia - we cannot ensure the security of the members of the mission"", according to the Ukrainian authorities.
In July, the deputy director of the State Agency for the Management of the Exclusion Zone in Ukraine, Maksim Sevciuk, asked the IAEA to put more pressure on Russia to leave the plant. He stated that the plant's six reactors have a lot of nuclear fuel. Also, large amounts of nuclear waste are accumulating.
The Ukrainian army published a video footage from the drone that shows that the Russian positions on the territory of the nuclear power plant were not bombed. Ukrainian officials claim that they cannot afford to bomb a nuclear power plant because the risks are too great.
EU Foreign Ministers discussed in mid-July a possible tightening of sanctions against Russia for deploying missile launchers at the nuclear power plant. While the international community warns Russia about the danger of a nuclear disaster, the Russian press, without presenting any evidence, accuses Kiev and the US of wanting this.
In 2016, the UN adopted a resolution, voted by the USA, the EU member states, etc., according to which the international community undertakes never to repeat the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which took place on the territory of Ukraine on April 26, 1986. Any nuclear disaster will brings damage to the whole world, and not just to a particular state, according to the resolution. Publication / Media:

In reality, as a result of the rocket attack, 23 civilians were killed, including children. A charity concert was supposed to take place in the Officers' House, which is not a military objective.
NEWS: ""Under the ruins of the Officers' House in Vinita after the Russian missile strike, there are not only representatives of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, who were discussing new arms deliveries from the EU.

The details of this high-precision strike in Vinita were described by the journalist Roman Golovanov during a discussion with the military expert of the ""Komsomolska Pravda"" newspaper, Viktor Baranet, who stated that the Russian military managed to kill the leadership of the Air Force with one blow of Ukraine"".

According to the testimony of an inferior officer from the support group who survived, the missile hit the presidium of the improvised military meeting, destroying at least 15 generals.
NARRATIVE: Russia killed at least 15 Ukrainian generals in Vinita with a single missile, stopping the counteroffensive in Donbass.
CONTEXT: Three Russian rockets hit a commercial building in the center of Vinita city, located near the Officers' House, with offices and representatives of small businesses, as well as the surrounding parking lot. More than 55 surrounding buildings were damaged as a result of the attack. At least 23 people were killed, including three children. The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the Vinita attack demonstrated once again that Russia must be recognized as a ""terrorist state"". ""No other state in the world represents such a terrorist threat as Russia. No other state in the world has allows to destroy peaceful cities and people with cruise missiles and artillery every day,"" Zelenskiy said. At the same time, the Armed Forces of Russia claim that they hit only one military objective.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Officers' House in Vinita is not a military objective, but a cultural one. On July 14, a charity concert was supposed to take place there, with the participation of the singer Roxolana. The event was announced long before on Ukrainian websites. The Officers' House in Vinita was a real cultural center, archipelago on weekends, with many children participating in various workshops and other activities.
Russia did not launch a single missile at Vinita, but several. According to Ukrainian media, the regional military center in Vinita is located a few kilometers from the Officers' House, and no meetings or meetings of the leadership of the Ukrainian Armed Forces took place in the locality, taking into account the proximity to the separatist region of Transnistria, seen as a threat.
The Russian government press did not provide any evidence about the missile that would have exactly hit the presidium of a meeting, attended by 15 Ukrainian generals. Viktor Baranet is quoted, who says that thanks to this attack, the deliveries of fighter planes from Poland were stopped and the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Donbass was stopped. In other words, the bombing of Vinita is presented as an achievement, as an attempt to ""save"" the residents of eastern and southern Ukraine from Kiev's counteroffensive. Baranet is not, however, an independent expert and does not provide proven information. On the website the publication ""Komsomolska pravda"" with which Baranet collaborates, the biography of the military expert is published. From there we learn that Viktor Baranet is a Russian officer in the reserve, he obtained many medals for ""Soviet heroism"", and in 2020 he became an emeritus journalist of Russia, a title conferred by the government. In other words, Baranet has the role of dressing in clothes journalistic and expert propaganda narratives of the Kremlin and to present them in a ""truthful"" style to the Russian-language media in the former Soviet states.
Veridica dismantled a series of propaganda narratives, which justified the killing of civilians by the Russian military on the territory of Ukraine. The Russian press wrote in April that the massacre in Bucea was an invention of ""Ukrainian propaganda"", and in May - that the Ukrainian army was bringing corpses to Lisiansk to stage a new massacre. In the first stages of the invasion, the Russian press argued that the Ukrainian military they destroyed the city of Mariupol, and Russia only attacked the buildings in the east of the country where American biological weapons laboratories were operating.

Previously, Sputnik radio reported that a decree was signed in Zaporizhia on the establishment of a commission that will organize a referendum"".
NARRATIVE: Zaporozhye has established international contacts with at least 15 countries, including EU members.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there are no contacts or international relations between the Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia and the Western states. The international community condemned the annexation of Crimea in 2014, did not recognize the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine and has no intention of changing its position towards other territories occupied by Russia in the large-scale invasion launched on February 24.
The EU has repeatedly asked Russia to stop military actions on the territory of Ukraine, to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine based on internationally recognized borders, and the EU member states have done the same. At the level of foreign ministers and state leaders, 7 packages of sanctions against Russia were discussed and introduced as a response to the unprovoked military actions in Ukraine. Therefore, the persons responsible for the foreign policies of the European states criticized Russia, initiated the deepening of the sanctions, requested the immediate withdrawal of the Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine, and there can be no question of international contacts with the separatist or occupation administrations.
In fact, the Zaporizhia region, partially occupied by Russian forces, is coordinated by the Regional State Administration, which is a legitimate body of the power in Kiev. Vladimir Rogov, mentioned by the Russian media as a ""member of the main council of the administration of the Zaporizhia region"" is a representative of the Russian bodies in the occupied area of ​​the region. Rogov fled to Russia in 2014, after speaking out against Euromaidan, he supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass, and in 2022 he was brought by Russia as a representative of Moscow in the Zaporozhye region. He was prosecuted for collaboration with Russia.
On July 20, the EU introduced sanctions against Vladimir Rogov for supporting or carrying out ""actions that undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, the stability or security of Ukraine"", according to the document. The inclusion of Rogov on the sanctions lists, coordinated by all EU member states is by no means an act establishing ""international contacts"" with it.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Veridica has debunked a series of false narratives regarding the situation in the Zaporozhye region. In April, the Russian press wrote that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporizhia are requesting to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. In May, Vladimir Rogov, quoted by Russian government press agencies, said that Ukraine is preparing to cede the city of Zaporozhye, and in June the Russian press wrote that volunteers from Zaporozhye are joining a battalion that will defend the region from the aggression of the Ukrainian army .
On July 20 a.c. the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov declared that Moscow is expanding its ""special operation"" in Ukraine to the southern regions: Kherson, Zaporozhye and others. In this context, the false narrative aims to justify military actions in Ukraine and to prepare public opinion from the former Soviet states for extending the war to other Ukrainian regions.

WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24, 2022, the Russian press is increasingly resorting to manipulating public opinion by intentionally misrepresenting press headlines. Most Russian publications and Telegram channels (News.ru, Gazeta.ru s.a.) wrote that the former American ambassador admitted for the first time that US scientists agree with Vladimir Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine.
At first reading, one gets the impression that American intellectuals support all actions, including military ones, of Russia on the territory of Ukraine. In the next paragraph of the text, it is specified that it is about the idea of ​​the unity of Russia and Ukraine, and it is only in the middle of the news that it is mentioned that it is, in fact, about history, and not about actuality! The unadvised reader is left with the idea that American scientists support Putin, unlike the political environment in Washington that supports Ukraine.
In another vein, the statement of the former American ambassador to Moscow was taken out of context and presented in a context favorable to Russian propaganda. Michael McFaul, in the interview given to the Ukrainian press, on the contrary, said that the historical truth is known in Washington, but he criticized some researchers from all over the world who are dominated by Soviet stereotypes: ""The Soviet Union has disappeared, but what I see it seems dangerous - Russian imperial narratives have not disappeared"".
The former diplomat mentioned that ""a program of re-educating humanity on the topic of Ukrainian and Russian history must be developed, so that all myths are dispelled and people learn the true history of Ukraine"", said the diplomat. Not presenting these fragments from the interview with Michael McFaul, the Russian press totally distorted the content of the initial information.
Also, the Russian press mentioned a series of false narratives dismantled by Veridica during the last year: the 2014 coup d'état in Kiev, Ukraine - a false state created by the USSR, the Ukrainian language - an invented language.
On July 12, 2021, an article signed by Vladimir Putin was published on the Kremlin's website, entitled ""On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians"". The disinformation narratives that were disseminated after the publication of this article aligned with the political theses of the leader from the Kremlin. The article repeats the false narrative about Ukraine as a ""fake state"". For Putin, the Europeanized Ukraine is anti-Russia, which the Russian president wants to combat in his article. Vladimir Putin believes that Russians and Ukrainians are close from a historical point of view, and the Ukrainian state appeared following the initiatives of the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin.

NARRATIVE: Ukrainian refugees from Germany will be accommodated in a former Nazi concentration camp
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: In reality, the photos of the buildings in the Sachsenhausen Memorial, on which banners were installed with the words ""Welcome to Germany"" in German, were faked. The Belarusian media published these photos, and the Russian media picked up the narrative. false, amplifying it. The administration of the Sachsenhausen Memorial denied this news, stating that it never intended to house refugees from Ukraine on the territory of the former Nazi concentration camp. A museum is currently operating there.
The management of the museum wrote on Twitter that older photos were used to create this false narrative. ""We condemn the appearance of a series of fake news related to the history of Nazism with the aim of distributing brutal propaganda messages,"" according to the museum's post.
The memorial publishes on Twitter and an official comment for the German publication MOZ, in which it is said that the former concentration camp was used by the Russian media for the dissemination of fake news, and the management of the museum notified the German police about this case.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of propaganda narratives that aim to sow fears among Ukrainian refugees and mistrust towards them in the EU member states. In May, the Russian press wrote that the EU is afraid of tuberculosis originating from NATO laboratories in Ukraine and which was brought to European states by Ukrainian refugees, and in June Russian propaganda announced that the EU would deport refugee men to Ukraine to be enlisted in the army. Ukrainian.
In order to strengthen readers' confidence in the false narratives about the absolutely negative attitude of EU citizens towards Ukrainians, the Russian press mentions a Polish newspaper that allegedly wrote about the ""hate of Europeans"" towards ""lazy Ukrainians"". In reality, the Russian press cites another propaganda narrative from June this year. The newspaper Rzeczpospolita wrote that the majority of Poles have a benevolent attitude towards Ukrainians, but some of them request conditioning of financial aid. Russian propaganda omitted the first part of the narrative, writing only about the Poles who want to see the Ukrainian refugees expelled from the country immediately. Publication / Media:

 NEWS: ""Poland is ready to go to a much more active collaboration on the Ukrainian issue with Hungary and Romania, in order to cover its plans to seize Western Ukraine, said the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia (SVR), reports RIA Novosti agency.

[...]
According to SVR, it seems that Warsaw does not notice that her ""secret"" ambitions and frustrations have become a source of ridicule and irritation for her ""protectors"" for many years.

Today, Simon's successors express, as is known, the same thing, but in simpler and cruder forms>>, it is shown in the SVR statement.
RIA recalls that, last week, Nariskin categorized Poland's plans to establish control over western Ukraine as dangerous for the whole of Europe; according to his words, if Warsaw opens this Pandora's Box, no one will have an escape."" NARRATIVE: Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to seize a part of Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, Serghei Nariskin, accuses Poland of setting up an operation to seize western Ukraine with the involvement of Hungary and Romania, but does not present any evidence. He tries to convince public opinion with the help of a document from 1935, which has nothing to do with the politics of today's Poland, a member of the EU and NATO.
In reality, the false narrative of the Russian government media, also taken over by the Romanian portal ""Vesti din Rusia"", is a reaction to the intensification of Ukrainian-Polish bilateral contacts in recent months. Recently, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, submitted a project to the Supreme Rada of the law on granting a special status to Poles in Ukraine. Polish citizens can stay on the territory of Ukraine for 18 months. They will benefit from all the rights and freedoms, just like Ukrainian citizens. Kiev and Warsaw have become very close during the war, which is not to Moscow's liking.
The Russian press distributed this news, without mentioning in the title that it is the opinion of a Russian state institution. Eadaily and Rossaprimavera wrote that Poland has already initiated a dialogue with Romania and Hungary for the invasion of Ukraine, without mentioning in the title that it is the point of view of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia
In April, Veridica dismantled a propaganda narrative on which the others that have appeared up to now are based. It is the statement of Nariskin who said that Poland will take control of its ""historical territories"" in Ukraine with the help of the USA.
In reality, Poland was the most vocal and active in combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. Warsaw has demonstrated through deeds that it is a real supporter of Ukraine. She is one of the staunchest supporters of EU sanctions against Moscow.
Both Poland, Romania and Hungary have mentioned that they will not get involved directly in the war in Ukraine, all of them being NATO member states. At the level of the North Atlantic Alliance, the decision was made to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia. Therefore, the analyzed news is false, and the theses presented by Nariskin are not based on any source or evidence.
Veridica has already written about a series of false narratives, according to which the President of Poland admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories, and Kiev would have allowed 10 thousand soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country.
Also, the Russian government press and Telegram channels, which are increasingly popular in the post-Soviet space, published a document signed by a Polish general regarding the annexation of western Ukraine. The Main Directorate of the Armed Forces of Poland announced to the public that it is a fake news and a forged document.
In fact, the Russian press is trying to demonstrate by manipulating public opinion that the efforts of Poland, Romania, Lithuania, the USA and other states to support the defensive actions of Ukraine have as their real goal to annex territories of the Ukrainian state. Publication / Media:

In reality, over 85% of the residents of eastern Ukraine condemn the Russian aggression, and the people quoted by the Moscow press do not represent the legitimate Ukrainian authorities. NEWS: ""The authorities and the inhabitants of the territories liberated from Kharkiv want the entire region to become part of Russia. The Temporary Civil Administration (ACT) supports these aspirations of the people, ACT head Vitali Gancev told TASS. ""However, our direction is to join Russia.

About 20% of the territory of the Kharkiv region was liberated. [According to Gancev], the situation in the liberated districts is complicated. A lot of localities are bombed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the danger of the activity of subversive groups is great"". NARRATIVE: Residents of the Kharkiv region are requesting to join Russia WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Kharkiv regional authorities have not made any statement regarding the residents' request to join Russia. The Kharkiv region is coordinated by the Regional Military Administration, led by a governor, and on the website of this institution we do not find any official information regarding the residents' desire to join Russia. The Russian press, in fact, quoted Vitali Gancev, who does not represent the Kharkiv regional authorities, being a collaborator of the Russian army of occupation. The Provisional Civil Administration, which, apparently, is a legitimate body of power, has nothing to do with the Kharkiv region or its residents. His statement Gancev about the authorities' full support of the requests of the residents of the region means the continuation of hostilities, bombings and military actions on the territory of Ukraine for the occupation of new Ukrainian localities. Therefore, the Russian army does not liberate, but occupies the territory of a sovereign state. Vitali Gancev is wanted by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, being accused of treason, collaboration with the enemy and support for Russia. He helped the Russian army to attack targets on the territory of Ukraine and transmitted information about the deployment of the Ukrainian military. The claim that the residents of the Kharkiv region want to join Russia is also false. In reality, 85% of Ukrainians in eastern Ukraine have a negative attitude towards Russia and only 4% - positive, according to a study conducted by the International Institute of Sociology in Kyiv. The majority of Russophones in eastern Ukraine are disappointed by Russia's decision to invade Ukrainian territory and bomb civilian infrastructure targets. It is worth mentioning that the head of the Kharkiv State Regional Military Administration, Oleg Sinegubov, declared that it is not necessary to evacuate the residents of the regional center because the danger of the city being occupied by Russia is not very high. He specified that Russia bombards various localities in the region daily, including the city of Kharkiv. The governor declared that he is in contact with the people from the localities occupied by Russia, emphasizing that they want to move to the territory controlled by the Ukrainian government, feeling totally insecure.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of similar false narratives. In April, the Russian press wrote that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye requested to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. In June, the press agencies in Russia distributed the story about hundreds of volunteers from Zaporozhye who will defend the region from the Ukrainian army. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the south of Ukraine, liberated by the nationalists, wants to be joined to Russia. These fake news are aimed at preparing the public opinion in Russia for new heated phases of the conflict in Ukraine and its expansion to other regions. Publication / Media:

It's a shorter logistics and the ammunition can be brought faster from abroad"".
NARRATIVE: Romania will help Ukraine recover Kherson.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In March this year Russia stated that Ukrainian fighter jets were relocated to Romanian territory. The Ministry of National Defense from Bucharest conveyed, through a press release, that the statement is completely false and that there are no Ukrainian military aircraft on Romanian territory.
""Most likely, they are trying to speculate on the example of the Ukrainian military aircraft Sukhoi 27 which requested, on February 24 - the first day of the illegal invasion of the Russian army in Ukraine, the emergency landing in Romania"", according to the Ministry.
The Russian press and political commentators from Moscow ignored the message of the Ministry of National Defense, continuing to build false narratives about Ukrainian military bases on Romanian territory.
The expert Aleksei Leonkov is one of the most quoted by Ukraina.ru and RIA Novosti when it comes to the situation in Ukraine.
In June, Leonkov declared that Romania and the Armed Forces of Ukraine will attack Kherson. He stated that ""Zelenski plans to involve soldiers from Romania in the war [...] disguised as soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine"". The same false narrative is repeated but in different ways about the Romanian state that will support the southern offensive of Ukraine, ignoring the statements and official positions of Bucharest.
Last but not least, we must take into account the fact that Romania is a NATO state and that at the level of the Alliance the decision was made to avoid a military involvement in Ukraine, given the risk of a war with Russia that could even degenerate into a nuclear conflict. Publication / Media:

""He must answer for the genocide against his own people, after which he hid behind a human shield. He must answer for the biological laboratories where experiments took place, for the killing of civilians in Luhansk and Donetsk, for the torture of Russian soldiers, for fascist propaganda.

NARRATIVE: Volodymyr Zelensky will be tried for war crimes.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The news distributed by the Russian press and Telegram channels from Russia and from the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk is not based on facts, but on the assumptions of a parliamentarian. Some publications did not mention in the title that it is the opinion of a politician, but presented the designation of Zelenski as a war criminal as a fact.
The headline of the news published by RIA Novosti says that at the moment humanity qualifies Zelenski as a war criminal. At the same time, the text of the news specifies that Zelenski could be tried for war crimes, this being, in fact, the personal conviction of a Russian deputy. Under the same aspect of manipulating public opinion, the news appears on the page of the ""Krasnaia Vesna"" Information Agency and on the Tsargrad TV station.
This technique of manipulation with the help of headlines partially separated from the content of the news is increasingly used by the Russian press in propaganda narratives.
In fact, the false narrative is a reaction to the statement of the president of Ukraine, who asked the UN to provide a definition of the terrorist state based on which Russia could be excluded from the UN General Assembly.
Deputy Aleksei Cerniak and the Russian press resume in a much more concise and systematized form the disinformation messages regarding Ukraine from the last 8 years.
The accusations from the Russian media against Kiev regarding the organization of a genocide in Ukraine are very old, being a justification for the war started on February 24 by the Kremlin. In reality, Ukrainians, including Russian speakers, are fighting the Russian invader on their territory. Russia is bombing Ukrainian towns, including with weapons prohibited by international law. The victims in Ukraine are caused by the Russian invasion, not by President Zelensky's decision to organize a defense of his state.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives whose main message is ""genocide organized by Kiev against Russophones"". According to the latest fake news of this kind, the Ukrainian army is massacring Russophones while fleeing from eastern Ukraine. In reality, Ukrainian forces they continue to resist, and the political leaders from Kiev declare that they will fight for each locality to defend the local population, including the Russian speakers, from the Russian invaders.
The president of Ukraine is also accused of supporting US laboratories, where biological weapons were created. This false justification of the Russian invasion was the subject of several press articles and TV shows, without any evidence for more than 4 months of the war. In reality, there were no laboratories in Ukraine where biological weapons were produced or developed. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons.
Veridica dismantled the basic narrative, which constitutes one of the cores of the war propaganda, according to which Russia is bombing Ukrainian cities to destroy biological weapons laboratories and save humanity. Moscow did not present any concrete proof of the existence of such laboratories, but justified the attack on Ukrainian cities and Snake Island by the need to destroy them.
Zelenski is also accused of promoting fascist ideology, but the fact that Nazi, fascist and communist symbols are prohibited in Ukraine is not mentioned. In May, the Russian press wrote that the Ukrainian neo-Nazis are holding civilians captive in the Kharkiv region, but they hid the fact that most of the local councils claimed war crimes committed by the Russian military.
In order to absolve Russia, the pro-Kremlin press wrote starting on February 24 that the Ukrainian military are neo-Nazis and commit war crimes against civilians in eastern and southern Ukraine. In reality, it is Russia that is bombing Ukrainian cities and has destroyed numerous civilian targets, including apartment buildings, schools, etc. The crimes are documented by journalists and independent investigators. According to a study by the School of Economics in Kyiv, in just 4 months the damage caused to Ukraine's economy by Russia is 600 billion dollars.
Therefore, not Zelenski, but Putin could be classified as a war criminal, there are already initiatives in this regard from Kiev. In Ukraine, the collection of evidence continues, with the support of teams of experts from the EU, to hold Russia accountable for war crimes. Publication / Media:

This was published in the conditions where Russia is accused of deporting Ukrainians, and the advance of its forces and the intense bombardment of some civilian targets have forced millions of people to flee.
NEWS: ""In Ukraine, a law could be adopted regarding the forced deportation of people from the area of ​​military actions,"" Serghei Gaidai, the head of the ""Luhansk Regional Military Administration"" appointed by Kiev, said live on Ukraina 24.
Civilians from the city of Lisiyansk in the frontline area of ​​the Luhansk People's Republic protested against this idea during its time under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Gaidai declared that in the northwestern city of the People's Republic of Luhansk, the situation of the Ukrainian military is very complicated, the fighting continues, there are about 15 thousand people in the town.
""There were proposals by certain deputies to deport this city. I told them: very well, quickly adopt a draft law on deportation and we will transport them from here"".
[...]
The residents claim that the ""Ukrainian army is attacking them"" and the Ukrainians are ""killing our children"". According to the television, the residents of the city of Lisiyansk ""came out in front of the Ukrainian military forces who were going to deport them"".
NARRATIVE: The residents of the Luhansk region will be deported by Kiev.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The beginning and the end of the news, published by RIA Novosti, demonstrate that the author of the information does not know clearly if Kiev tried to deport the residents of the Luhansk region or if this initiative is only at the level of political discussions. According to the false narrative, Kiev is going to adopt a deportation law, then it is mentioned that the residents of the city of Lysiyansk came out in front of the Ukrainian military forces who ""were going to deport them"" without any law! It is not clear why it would have been necessary by a law if the deportation of Russian speakers was to follow anyway.
Moreover, the Russian press writes that the city of Lisiansk is under the control of the armed forces of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, but Russian speakers fear a deportation law that may be adopted in Kiev. It is not clear why residents of a city no longer under Ukrainian control should fear a Ukrainian law. In reality, fighting is still taking place in Lysiyansk and Ukrainian forces continue to resist.
Apart from a series of logical contradictions in the text of the news, Russian propaganda totally distorted the statement of the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. He did not say that a deportation law is to be adopted.
""There were proposals from some people to forcibly evacuate the region. But this means deportation. Our state is called Ukraine, not Russia. We will not proceed in this way,"" Gaidai said.
In other words, the official mentioned that the deportation of civilians is prohibited in Ukraine, unlike Russia, which deports Ukrainians. On the website of the Parliament of Ukraine, we do not find any draft law that would refer to the deportation or evacuation of people.
In fact, at the end of May, Ukraine reported on the forced deportation to Russia of 1.4 million Ukrainians. Kiev asked international organizations to monitor the situation of Ukrainians forcibly deported to Russia.
Veridica recently dismantled a series of false narratives, according to which the Ukrainian army is massacring Russian speakers during the withdrawal from Donbass, and the EU is accused of deporting refugee men to Ukraine to be enlisted in the Ukrainian army.
The purpose of these narratives is to sow mistrust among the population of eastern Ukraine towards the Ukrainian authorities and to discourage the process of territorial defense. Publication / Media:

In reality, the deportation of refugees to their country of origin is prohibited by international law, so Ukrainian citizens who fled the war to the EU cannot be sent back.
NEWS: ""The European Union authorities are thinking of mass deporting Ukrainian refugees from their territory in order to help Kiev with the mobilization of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, announced the vice-president of the military-civilian administration in the Kherson region, Kiril Stremousov. He told Ukraina.ru that this step of the EU takes place against the background of the refusal of the inhabitants of Ukraine to fight on the side of the regime in Kiev or to somehow help the country's army.
Now the EU is examining the possibility of deporting all Ukrainian men to Ukraine to support the ""moghilization"" (funeral - ed.), said Stremousov, adding that he did not make any mistake in his statement, as enlistment in the army in Ukraine is not a mobilization, but a one-way ticket.
Ukrainians no longer understand the point of filling the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and giving their lives not for a state, but for a certain regime. EU help was needed, explains the vice-president.""
NARRATIVE: The EU will deport refugee men to Ukraine to be enlisted in the Ukrainian army.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukrainian citizens cannot be deported to Ukraine because they are legally on the territory of the EU states. International legislation and the recommendations of human rights organizations prohibit the deportation of people who have fled conflict zones. At the same time, the deportation of a foreign citizen can take place in case of committing crimes on the territory of the host state, the court's decision being necessary.
According to the European Convention on Human Rights, foreign citizens can be deported only in the situations provided by law. In other words, the EU cannot out of the blue adopt a political and discriminatory decision regarding the deportation of Ukrainian men with the aim of being enlisted in the army. Moreover, people who have applied for refugee status are offered protection at the level of the EU states. Also, the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees prohibits the signatory states from deporting people who have fled the war.
It should be noted that the Russian press does not cite European sources, close to the political decision-makers in the EU, but a representative of the Russian occupation body on the territory of Ukraine, called the military-civilian administration of the Kherson region. Kiril Stremousov is wanted on the territory of Ukraine, being accused of treason and collaboration with the army of the aggressor state. The regional party of which Stremousov was a member was banned on the territory of Ukraine.
Neither the Russian media nor the collaborator Kiril Stremousov provide any proof of the EU's intentions to deport the Ukrainians. There is no declaration at the EU level in this regard, nor any request at the level of the relevant Ukrainian ministries.
The propaganda narrative seeks to undermine the image of the EU and the Ukrainian government (which send people to their deaths) but also to demoralize the Ukrainian forces through formulas like ""a one-way ticket"". Publication / Media:

And here Bandera is already a saint. Unfortunately, every time it seems that the Kiev regime is definitively falling into sin, it proves again that it can fall even further into the fiery hell"".
NARRATIVE: The nationalist leader Stepan Bandera was canonized in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In order to prove to the public opinion in Russia and the population of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk that Ukrainian society is a Nazi society and the special denazification operation deserves to be continued, the Russian press writes that the nationalist leader of the last century, Stepan Bandera, was canonized by The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which obtained the Tomos of autonomy in 2019. In reality, there has never been such an initiative. On June 20, the Holy Synod did not take place, as the Russian press mentions. The last Synod of Bishops took place in Kiev on May 24, according to the website of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. On the official website you can find all the initiatives and discussions about canonization, which from the point of view of the procedure could last from several months to several years. Stepan Bandera is not mentioned in any way.
The Russian press also cites a document signed by the Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine Epiphany, in which it is said that the canonization decision ""comes into force today"". The document contains serious stylistic mistakes in the Ukrainian language and does not respect the form and spirit of documents of this kind .
At the same time, the Russian press ignored an important nuance during the construction of this propaganda narrative - Stepan Bandera was Greek-Catholic and theoretically cannot be canonized by a church other than the one to which he professedly belonged. The image used by the Russian media with the faces, the icon of Stepan Bandera was copied from the TSN news site from Kiev, it is about Stepan's father, Andrei Bandera, a Ukrainian Greek Catholic leader, who was killed in 1941. There was an initiative to recognize Andrei Bandera as a martyr of the Greek Catholic Church in 2015, but without any result. The Russian press copied Andrei Bandera's image from the news published in 2015 on the Kiev website and reported that it is an icon of Stepan Bandera.
The propaganda narrative justifies in the eyes of public opinion in Russia the military actions carried out against the population of Ukraine, demonstrating that the Ukrainians are dominated by neo-Nazi ideas and are increasingly falling ""toward the fiery hell"". Publication / Media:

At the beginning of this year, in Kharkiv, Nikolaev, Dnepropetrovsk and other cities, several exhibits were prepared for evacuation.

Moreover, some of the exhibits are already presented to the public.
Not all the precious exhibits are in Denmark - some have already been included in private collections or are in museums in Western countries, which for a pair of old tanks came into possession of historical relics...""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine pays off Western armaments with Ukrainian museum exhibits.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The news starts from a post on the Telegram channel of the pro-Russian politician Aleksandr Semchenko, who writes that Ukraine paid for the weapons received from the West with museum exhibits. He mentioned that, for a pair of old tanks, ""the Westerners came into possession of historical relics"", the information being distributed by the Russian press.
The only evidence posted on the Telegram channel is the image of a painting transported, the faces, from Kharkiv abroad. In reality, the image represents the evacuation of a painting from the ""Andrei Septitki"" National Museum in Lviv. The evacuation took place in March against the background of bombings on the towns in western Ukraine. All the paintings were moved from the exhibition hall to shelters.
The evacuation of the museum fund took place in the context of Russia's destruction of some museums and cultural monuments in Ukraine. On May 7, the Russian military bombed the ""Grigori Skovoroda"" National Museum in Skovorodinovka. More than 25 works of the painter Maria Primacenko were destroyed in the Museum in Ivankovo ​​in the Kyiv region. Also cultural homes, theaters, universities and schools. For the defense of these and other civilian objectives, Kiev requested armaments from the West.
The Russian press does not provide any proof, apart from the fake photographic one, to prove that the Ukrainian exhibits are offered to the European states in exchange for armaments. According to an analysis carried out by the Ukrainian press, most museums face difficulties during the evacuation, and this process is regulated by an order of the Cabinet of Ministers, which, among other things, prohibits the transportation of exhibits abroad.

The narrative takes elements from the ""Great Reset"" conspiracy theory.
NEWS: ""Invited to a debate show on current affairs, Iosefina Pascal asked a representative of the National Institute of Statistics (INS) about what would happen to the data collected from the population census. The latter specified that the data will be anonymized, and after the statistics, will be deleted. The GOLD FM journalist disapproves of the INS representative claiming that the data from the census would reach European institutions.
""The data on the state of health of Romanians, information on birth rates and mortality will reach the World Health Organization (WHO). Also, depending on the interest of that European entity, the INS will execute and transmit the so-called deleted information. A census of the population is necessary, but what happened this year and what will happen again should raise many question marks"" - says Iosefina Pascal"". NARRATIVE: Romanians will have their personal data collected, which will then be handed over to the WHO for it to use at its own discretion.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: Romania started the population and housing census on March 14, with the self-review stage that was completed on May 27. Later, after this date until July 17, the stage of face-to-face interviews will take place, carried out by reviewers with the help of tablets.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the census was postponed by a year, and for the first time it will no longer be done on paper, but in electronic format, in order to greatly avoid contacts.
According to the INS, people who refuse self-review will not be fined, but those reviewed and who refuse to provide information or provide erroneous/incomplete data may be fined from 1,000 lei to 3,000 lei, according to article 54 of GEO 19 /2020.
Adherents of the conspiracy theory and the media that rely on pro-Kremlin narratives in Romania used the occasion of the census to issue narratives regarding these statistics that are collected periodically and based on which public policies are naturally drawn up in the fields of health, education, economic - social and so on.
The reviewers are authorized persons who act according to the law, and the data collection is in accordance with the national legislation. Moreover, it is for the first time that the population and housing count will be 100% computerized.
""Romania needs to know the resident population not only at the national level, but also at the level of all localities. The data obtained are used to calculate indicators at the European level. Certain European funds are distributed in relation to the population of a certain locality. Localities can receive funds depending on the resident population, which we calculate on the occasion of the census,"" declared INS president Tudorel Andrei for Digi24.
OBJECTIVE: Influencing the population to undermine their trust in medical institutions worldwide.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The data normally collected by the National Institute of Statistics at the national level anyway reach Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, responsible for the publication of statistics and indicators, at the European level, which allow comparisons between countries and regions.
Eurostat collaborates with the World Health Organization (WHO) on such statistics.
Also, the World Health Organization manages and maintains a wide range of databases related to global health and well-being, in accordance with the mandate of the WHO member states, including Romania.
When the INS representative says on the show that the data will be anonymized and deleted, Iosefina Pascal does not come with any evidence that would contradict this, but launches a theory without being able to prove this.
The WHO is one of the frequent targets of anti-vaxxers and followers of the ""conspiracy theory"". In Romania, the WHO was the favorite target of conservative groups and the media that were in charge of spreading fake news and disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Veridica he clearly signaled this before.
The fact that the WHO could use statistical data about the health of Romanians goes against the logic of existence and the central mission of this world organization that has been taking care of people's health globally for decades.
Moreover, the author of the article, Iosefina Pascal, is a constant promoter of disinformation related to vaccination and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Iosefina Pascal's thesis is further part of the conspiracy theory that speaks of the ""Great Reset"", a conspiracy narrative that is also promoted on Russian social networks such as Odnosklassniki.
The great reset, in the vision of the conspiracists, refers to the enslavement of ordinary people by a ""world occult"", an elite of very rich characters with petty goals.
Veridica dismantled this narrative and explained that this term was initially promoted by characters close to former American President Donald Trump. ""The Great Reset"" was an expression used at the Davos Economic Forum in September 2020.
""There is an urgent need for stakeholders to cooperate globally for the simultaneous management of the direct consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. In order to improve the situation in the world, the World Economic Forum is starting the ""Great Reset"" initiative.
From here, it was only one step for these statements to enter the area of ​​conspiracy about what, in fact, would mean the ""Great Reset"". Repeated obsessively by Russian propaganda in the main media subordinate to the Kremlin, they were picked up and constantly regurgitated and in the media vehicles in Romania that promote these Russian narratives.

In reality, Russia is forcibly mobilizing Ukrainian civilians from the occupied localities in this region, violating international conventions, and the city of Zaporozhye is still under the control of the Ukrainian army.
NEWS: ""Lists of volunteers for the defense of the land by the Ukrainian army have started to appear in the Zaporizhia region, there are already over 200 applicants, said the head of the military-civilian administration of the region, Evgheni Balitki.

Military-civilian administrations were formed in the regions, Russian television and radio stations began to be broadcast, and commercial relations with Crimea are restored. The regions intend to become part of Russia.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the armed forces are only hitting the military infrastructure and Ukrainian troops, and starting with March 25 they have fulfilled the main tasks of the first stage - they have significantly reduced Ukraine's fighting potential. According to the Russian military department, the main goal is the liberation of the Donbass region"".
NARRATIVE: Volunteers from Zaporizhia join a battalion that will defend the region from the Ukrainian army.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The city of Zaporizhia is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the region with the same name is coordinated by the Regional State Military Administration. So, in the city of Zaporozhye, which is under the control of the Ukrainian army, civil defense battalions cannot defend themselves against government military forces.
The occupation bodies, cited by the pro-Kremlin media, do not represent the Zaporizhia regional authorities and do not have the right to speak on behalf of all residents. On the website of the Zaporizhia Regional State Military Administration, we do not find any information about lists of volunteer battalions opposing Kiev.
Evgheni Balitchi is quoted, who was appointed by Russia as the head of the ""military-civilian administration"", which is an occupation body that obeys the Russian military. In other words, Balitchi represents the Kremlin in the localities occupied by Russian troops. Therefore, he is not it is about the legitimate Ukrainian authorities, as the Russian press mentions.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) considers Balitchi a collaborator of Russia, which initiates the creation of civilian detachments with the aim of persecuting Ukrainians who have spoken out against the Russian authorities in the past. Evgheni Balitki was a member of the Party of Regions of the pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych and of the Opposition Platform, banned on the territory of Ukraine during martial law.
The Russian press also used the method of quoting some self-proclaimed officials from Donbass to justify the ""special operation"" in Ukraine in front of public opinion. In May of this year, the pro-Kremlin press quoted Vladimir Rogov, as a representative of the Zaporizhia Regional Administration, he is a collaborator of the Russian occupation authorities in the south-east of Ukraine. He fled to Russia in 2014, after he spoke out against Euromaidan, supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass.
The Ukrainian ombudsman Liudmila Denisova states that in the towns of the Zaporozhye region, occupied by Russia, the Russian army is forcibly mobilizing men, looking for them in houses, cellars and on the streets. The Ukrainian authorities remind that enlisting civilians from the occupied regions in the army is prohibited by the Geneva Convention.
The propaganda narrative was distributed after the Russian press wrote in May that Ukraine would cede the city of Zaporozhye to Russia, and in April that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye requested to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the south of Ukraine, liberated by the nationalists, wants to be joined to Russia. Veridica dismantled these and other fake news, which aim to prepare public opinion in Russia for new heated phases of the conflict in Donbass and its expansion to other regions. Publication / Media:

On February 24, Russia launched a special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine. According to the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, the purpose of this operation is to defend the inhabitants of Donbass.
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian army massacres Russian speakers during the withdrawal from Donbass.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there is no decision by Kiev to withdraw its troops from Donbass. According to a report of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukrainian troops are successfully repelling enemy attacks. Severodonetk and Toskivske are totally or partially under the control of Ukraine. The Ukrainian army informs that Russia has concentrated its military forces in Donbass, but Kiev responded in the mirror. There is no mention of any initiative to withdraw the Ukrainian army from Donbass.
The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy admitted that the battle for Donbass could be decisive in the Russian-Ukrainian war, mentioning that he will do everything possible to prevent the occupation of new localities by Russia.
The thesis about the massacre of Russophones is a false one, being a continuation of the propaganda narratives about the genocide of the population of Donbass. The so-called special operation of demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine launched by Russia is in reality a brutal war of conquest, as a result of which civilians, children, old people are killed, houses, kindergartens, schools are destroyed. Russia does not defend the population, on the contrary, it faced resistance from Russian speakers in the east, south and north, who denounced the invasion organized by the Kremlin. The Russian army is the one that committed war crimes against civilians in Bucea, Irpin, Borodianka, Mariupol and other localities.
According to a national sociological survey, over 90% of Ukrainians believe in Kiev's victory over Moscow. Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives, according to which almost three million Ukrainians want to emigrate to Russia, the UN supports the genocide directed against Russian-speakers in Ukraine, Kiev uses its citizens as human shields, while Russia protects Ukrainian civilians.
The purpose of these narratives is to show Russia as a defender of the ""Russian world"", while Ukraine, the victim-state defending itself, is accused of Nazism, Russophobia and crimes against humanity. Publication / Media:

In reality, Stoltenberg praised the fight in Ukraine and condemned Russia.
NEWS: ""NATO believes that peace in Ukraine can be achieved in the case of territorial concessions on the part of Kiev. The settlement of the conflict in Ukraine can take place, but Kiev will probably have to make certain concessions, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during the meeting with the President of Finland Sauli Niinisto.
""Peace in Ukraine is possible. It depends on its price. How much territory, how much independence, how much freedom, how much democracy is willing to pay for peace. It's a complicated moral dilemma,"" Stoltenberg said.
According to the general secretary of the Alliance, only the Ukrainian residents must decide in which way peace will be achieved"", notes RTVI.
""Stoltenberg stated that without territorial concessions on the part of Ukraine, peace will not be possible, and NATO will help Kiev pay the lowest price for peace,"" Komsomolksa Pravda newspaper writes.
NARRATIVE: The Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg did not say that, in order to make peace, Ukraine must cede territories. During the meeting with the president of Finland, Stoltenberg said that the highest price of freedom is paid by the Ukrainians, adding that peace can be achieved through Putin's decision to stop the absurd war. The Secretary General of NATO did not propose to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace. Nowhere in Stoltenberg's speech do we find such a quote. His words were taken out of context and intentionally misrepresented to create the impression in the Russian-speaking information space that NATO would recognize Russia's territorial claims against Ukraine as legitimate.
Jens Stoltenberg did not declare that NATO will help Kiev to pay the lowest price for peace, but mentioned that ""it will support Ukraine so that its negotiating position is as strong as possible"".
The NATO Secretary General referred not to the moral dilemma of the Ukrainians regarding the territorial cessions, but to the dilemma of the Ukrainian fighters: ""We pay a price. We help and we see the economic consequences of the sanctions, but without a doubt, the Ukrainians pay the highest price [...] You must not forget every morning, day or hour that only one person, one people, is to blame. by Putin"".
Stoltenberg did not ask Kiev to cede territories to Russia, but analyzed the negotiation process, which depends on military actions: ""It is not a question of whether peace is possible. The question would be what price are you willing to pay for it. How much territory, how much independence, how much sovereignty, how much freedom, how much democracy are you willing to sacrifice for peace. It is a complicated moral dilemma that will only be resolved by those who pay the highest price. Our obligation is to support them"".
Therefore, Stoltenberg referred to the Ukrainian military, which, in order not to cede territories and not lose the country's sovereignty, is fighting with Russia, and only Kiev can decide when it should stop and if it should. In fact, Stoltenberg's message is the opposite of the one intentionally wrongly presented by the pro-Kremlin press to convince the public opinion that Russia is recording remarkable successes during the ""special military operation"" and that NATO is slowly beginning to recognize this reality.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding territorial cessions, according to which Ukraine is not rebuilding Kharkov because it knows that it will join Russia, Kiev will cede the city of Zaporozhye to Russia, while 95% of Ukrainians expect to be freed from Russia. These propaganda narratives indicate informational preparations in Russia for a possible annexation of new Ukrainian territories. Publication / Media:

In reality, the Chinese delegation listened carefully the speech of the Ukrainian leader and did not leave the conference room.
NEWS: The Chinese delegation left the hall during the speech of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Shangri La Dialogue security summit in Singapore, said the senior analyst of the US Asian Research Center, Olivia Enos.
""Zelenski is speaking at the Shangri La Dialogue 2022. The Chinese delegation has left the room,"" Enos wrote on Twitter (the network is blocked in the Russian Federation).
On the territory of Ukraine, a special Russian operation of denazification and demilitarization of the state is taking place. The President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, emphasized that the main goal of the operation is the liberation of the DNR and LNR territories. Chinese citizens have repeatedly expressed their admiration for Russia's resistance to the pressure caused by the sanctions of the western states.
NARRATIVE: The Chinese delegation left the hall during Zelenski's speech at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: After Russia invaded Ukraine, on February 24, Moscow presented its military actions as a ""special operation"" to denazify the Ukrainian state. The Russian press writes that the special operation is supported by China (but also other states ), despite the fact that Beijing did not have a clear public position.
OBJECTIVE: To convince public opinion in Russia and the former Soviet states that Moscow's actions in Ukraine are correct and supported by China.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: The Russian press cites a Twitter account, despite the fact that this network has even been classified in Russia as one of fake news.
According to the Center for Strategic Communication and Informational Security of Ukraine, no delegation left the conference room when President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke. The Center quotes a participant at the conference, who stated that no one was allowed to leave the room and mentions that the senior analyst of the US Asian Research Center, Olivia Enos, deleted the post from Twitter.
The video recording of Volodymyr Zelensky's message and the discussions with the leader from Kiev is 28 minutes long. It can be clearly seen that during Zelenski's speech, no one left the room. Therefore, the pro-Kremlin press is lying when it reports about the protest of the Chinese delegation to Ukraine.
The Russian press manipulates public opinion and when it writes that Beijing expresses its admiration for Russia regarding its resistance to sanctions; in fact, Ura.ru refers to some comments on a regional blog, not to any official position of the authorities. Publication / Media:

It is assumed that parts of the hypersonic weapons of the Russian Federation were studied as part of the collection of data on Moscow's achievements in the technical-military field"".
NARRATIVE: The US is studying Russian weapons captured in Ukraine in order to copy its ultra-modern technology.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The narrative in the Russian media starts from an article published by The New York Times according to which American experts arrived in Ukraine at the invitation of the Security Service in Kiev to analyze how Russia uses advanced Western technologies, in especially the chips, for the production of the weaponry with which Moscow hits military and civilian targets on Ukrainian territory.
It should be noted that, starting in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea and the launch of the conflict in Donbass, the USA and the EU introduced sanctions against Russia, which primarily provide for the partial ban of exports to Russia of electronic components and chips that are used for the production of weapons. After the outbreak of Russia's war against Ukraine on February 24, an export embargo on semiconductors, computers, chips, etc. was introduced. to create difficulties for Russia regarding the production of modern weapons. The US has declared that it will carry out in-depth research in order to find out how Western technologies end up in the hands of Russia, bypassing the embargo.
Therefore, the purpose of the visit to Ukraine by the military experts was not to ""copy ultra-modern Russian technology"", but to find out if electronic chips from the West reach Russia - basically, to find out how Russia builds its weapons with the help of Western technology The New York Times, quoted by the Russian press, writes that the experts identified American electronic chips in the captured weaponry, but all marking and description elements of these technological components were removed. For now, it is not known how these technologies arrived in Russia.
The Russian press does not remember anything about these conclusions of the American publication, but promoted a false narrative about the desire of the US to copy Russia's high-performance military technology, with the help of which Moscow would record great successes in the ""special operation"".
The purpose of the narrative is to strengthen the confidence of Russian citizens in the armed forces and in the Kremlin, which would have the most modern and efficient weaponry in the world, ""hunted by the American services"". These propaganda messages are a continuation of the narratives from the USSR period, according to which the American spies were on the territory of the Soviet republics and were looking for the secret schemes of ultramodern military technologies that were not found in the USA, but history has shown that in reality the USSR was technologically surpassed by the West.

The false narrative aims to discredit this international organization, which was denied access to the area occupied by Russia, where it intends to get involved in the evacuation of civilians and provide medical care to the population.
NEWS: Following the investigation, hundreds of children's medical records were found at the headquarters of the Red Cross in Mariupol. Military expert Vladimir Evseev explained how and for what purposes they were used.
""Tarigrad"" previously reported that hundreds of children's medical records were found at the headquarters of the Russian Cross mission. Diseases are not indicated, only data about healthy organs appear. It was specified that all the information was entered using the Latin alphabet.
[...]
During a long period, the Ukrainian Nazis organized the transportation of human organs to Europe. At first, they contacted the relatives of the Ukrainian soldier who was on his deathbed. After they expressed their agreement, the military organ was sold, explained the expert.
After this scheme became functional, they went to the civilians of Donbass. They mainly dealt with girls and children. In fact, if Russia did not launch the special operation in Ukraine, a large part of the children in Donbass would be sold for organs. These activities were coordinated by the Red Cross, Evseev said.
NARRATIVE: Children in Donbass were sold for organs under the coordination of the Red Cross.
CONTEXT: After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) repeatedly requested Moscow to allow the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol and the provision of medical care to the population. Russia has refused each time to allow Red Cross experts to work in the area, and on several occasions has broken its ceasefire commitments to allow evacuation through humanitarian corridors. The Red Cross and the OSCE denounced the lack of cooperation shown by Russia, so that both organizations became targets of Russian propaganda.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to discredit the initiatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross to evacuate civilians in Donbass and to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Red Cross immediately reacted to the allegations by the pro-Kremlin media calling them false. ""The ICRC did not collect such data. The video also insinuates that the ICRC is involved in organ trafficking. This is another false accusation"", according to a Red Cross press release. The ICRC emphasizes that its objectives are purely humanitarian in nature. ""We face challenges in areas affected by armed conflicts, but our work is intended to minimize suffering, nothing more. We trust that most people will recognize false claims when they see them,"" said Jason Straziuso, an ICRC spokesman.
In another ICRC report, it is said that on March 15, the experts of the International Committee mission left Mariupol. At the end of March, its headquarters in the city were bombed. Even the ""Tarigrad"" website publishes in the news about the medical files of children from the ICRC a photo of the destroyed headquarters, where everything is burned, except for ""a safe with a stack of medical files""!
The advisor to the mayor of Mariupol, Petro Andriuscenko, wrote on Telegram that the occupiers searched the headquarters of the Red Cross and found some medical records, adding: ""This is the same building destroyed by Russia.""
The Russian press does not publish any concrete evidence to prove that the files were found at the ICRC headquarters, which is in fact destroyed, that they are not medical files of the occupation authorities and that it is not a stage. In addition, the ICRC is probably the most well-known and respected international humanitarian organization, and its history and the way it has behaved throughout its almost 160 years of activity in conflict zones, show how ridiculous the accusations are they bring
The false narrative is built on the model of the news about the OSCE mission in Mariupol, accused of collaborating with the ""Azov"" regiment and of providing it with information. Veridica recently dismantled this false narrative of the media controlled by the Kremlin, which started a real campaign to discredit the the efforts of the OSCE to maintain peace and the Red Cross to help civilians in the area to convince the domestic public opinion that the evidence of international experts regarding Russian destabilizing actions in Donbass is false.

The narrative is built starting from an opinion poll that doesn't even address this topic.
NEWS: 56.8% of the respondents who took part in the survey carried out by the Rzeczpospolita newspaper ""firmly support"" or ""moderately support"" the idea of ​​the participation of the Polish army in a ""pacification"" mission on the territory of Ukraine.
A few days ago, President Duda expressed his fantasies regarding the ""disappearance of the borders between Poland and Ukraine"", which represents a test of public opinion regarding the future military aggression and recovery of the ""eastern regions"" [of Poland].
Rzeczpospolita is a right-wing newspaper (traditionally journalists support the Russophobes in the ruling party, but distance themselves from them in public) and this must be taken into account. However, the popularization of militarism and aggressive rhetoric in Poland, but also in the whole of Europe, is an obvious situation.
NARRATIVE: The majority of Poles support the invasion of the western regions of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, 56.8% of Poles declared that they support any participation of Poland in a possible pacification mission on the territory of Ukraine if this mission will be organized by the EU, NATO or the UN, so it is not about any unilateral military action. The survey therefore referred to the hypothetical involvement of Poland alongside the international community in solving the crisis in Ukraine. If we carefully read the article in Rzeczpospolita in which the results of the survey are presented, we will not find any dominant narrative in the Russian press. Nothing is said about the invasion of Ukraine, about Polish territories that now belong to Ukraine, about Warsaw's military aggression, about Russophobia. All these elements absent in Rzeczpospolita constitute 90% of the information published in the Russian press and actively distributed at the beginning of June on Telegram channels in Russia.
Both the president and the prime minister of Poland have shown through concrete facts that they support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. The fantasies regarding the ""disappearance of the borders between Poland and Ukraine"" attributed to the president of Poland are in reality an initiative to establish joint control points at the border between the two states.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives by the pro-Kremlin media regarding Poland's ""interests"" in the war in Ukraine. In May, the Russian media wrote that the president of Poland admitted that Warsaw would annex Ukrainian territories after the head of Russian espionage, Sergei Nariskin, declared that Poland would take control of its ""historical territories"" in Ukraine with the help of the US.
Also in May, the Russian press accuses Ukraine in propaganda narratives of having allowed 10,000 soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country, following the distribution of false news about the high expectations of the Poles regarding the invasion of Ukraine.
Poland was the most vocal and active of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts, becoming a target of Russian propaganda. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: OSCE collaborates with the ""Azov"" regiment from Mariupol and provides it with information.
CONTEXT: On the Telegram channel of the self-proclaimed head of the Security Council of the Donetsk People's Republic, Aleksandr Khodakovski, a photo of a satellite phone with an OSCE label, which is supposed to have been used by the regiment, was published. Azov"".
From the photo posted on Telegram, it is not clear if it is a phone used by OSCE observers, if it was found in ""Azovstal"" or somewhere else, if it is a real or fake image. This phone could have ended up in the hands of the separatists for a long time some time ago and now it is used to blame the OSCE for supporting the ""Azov"" regiment, considered by Russia to be a terrorist and a Nazi.
The phone could still be found in the OSCE offices in eastern Ukraine, located in the cities occupied by the Russian military. It is not known if these phones were used by the Ukrainian military and if they were found in Azovstal or in other cities.
OBJECTIVE: The media controlled by the Kremlin started a real campaign to discredit the efforts of the OSCE to maintain peace in the area in order to convince the domestic public opinion that the evidence of international experts regarding Russian destabilizing actions in Donbass is false.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the experts of the OSCE Special Mission in Ukraine monitored, starting in 2014, both the activity of the ""Azov"" regiment and the pro-Russian separatists in Donbass, something proven, moreover, by the reports that they presented them regularly.
OSCE representatives repeatedly complained about the unfounded criticism of the separatist leaders, drawing attention to the fact that they only published official reports and did not support any part of the conflict. The head of the special OSCE monitoring mission in Ukraine actually sees the criticism as an indication of impartiality. At the same time, both Russia and the leaders financed by it in Donbass had the right, during the last 8 years, to get rid of the OSCE presence in the area because the experts were documenting all the violations of the truce.
The propaganda narrative is in fact a justification for the arrest of four members of the OSCE special mission in Lugansk and Donetsk, on charges of collaboration with foreign intelligence services. 3 days after the international experts were detained in eastern Ukraine, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zbigniew Rau, and the Secretary General of the OSCE, Helga Maria Schmid, condemned this action.
The OSCE statement says that the members of the Special Mission must be released immediately, and ""the permanent accusations against the members of the OSCE mission are absurd"". Publication / Media:

The objective is to sow panic among the Ukrainian population and to convince the internal public opinion that the ""special operation"" is being carried out successfully and can be extended to other Ukrainian regions.
NEWS: ""The Kiev regime is preparing to cede the city of Zaporozhye,"" the member of the main council of the Zaporozhye Regional Administration, Vladimir Rogov, told RIA Novosti.
Previously he communicated that two thirds of the territory of the region was liberated by the Russian army from the control of Ukrainian nationalists. Kyiv controls the regional center - the city of Zaporozhye.
The Zaporizhia authorities declare that Ukraine has forever lost access to the Sea of ​​Azov. Zaporozhye will be liberated. Our enemies are also aware of this fact. That's why evacuation is discussed 24 hours a day. Zelenski's representatives from the city have prepared their bags and are transporting the expensive things from the city,"" said Rogov.
He declared that after the liberation of Donbass, the turn of the city of Zaporizhia will come. In the special operation, the Russian military took control over the Kherson region and a part of the Zaporozhye region in the south of the country, which has access to the sea. Military-civilian administrations were established in the regions, television and radio stations from Russia began to be broadcast, commercial ties with Crimea are being restored"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine will cede the city of Zaporozhye to Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly declared that they will not cede a single millimeter of Ukrainian territory to Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized those who recommend Ukrainians to capitulate to Russia and cede territories and emphasized that Ukraine will not cede territories on its own initiative and will not abandon its citizens.
Part of the Zaporozhye region is occupied by Russia, but the Ukrainian military is consolidating its defense fortifications. According to Lieutenant General Serghei Naev, Ukrainian defenders are successfully repelling Russian attacks in the Zaporozhye region, although Moscow is concentrating more and more of its military forces in the south of Ukraine. In addition, some localities in the southeast of the country were liberated by the Ukrainian army, the most recent being the successful counter-offensive in the direction of Krivoi Rog.
Indeed, in the city of Zaporizhia, there is discussion about a possible evacuation of civilians, as a plan B, if the Ukrainian army will no longer be able to defend the town. The discussions about the possible evacuation plan do not, however, mean the surrender of the administrative center of Zaporizhia, but only the acceptance of the possibility that, at a given moment, a withdrawal could be imposed, these being otherwise related to the nature of the war. Losing a certain territory to an enemy does not mean giving up that territory or abandoning plans to recover it.
The person quoted by the Russian press, Vladimir Rogov, is not the representative of the Zaporizhia Regional Administration, but the representative of the Russian occupation bodies in the southeast of Ukraine. He fled to Russia in 2014, after speaking out against the Euromaidan, he supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass, and in 2022 he was brought by Russia as a representative of Moscow in the Zaporozhye region. Rogov was prosecuted for collaborating with Russia. Like the representatives of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, Rogov does not know what the real situation is in Zaporozhye, because the Russian army is still far from the town.
The propaganda narrative was distributed after the Russian press wrote in April that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye requested to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the south of Ukraine, liberated by the nationalists, wants to be joined to Russia. Veridica dismantled these and other fake news, which aim to prepare public opinion in Russia for new heated phases of the conflict in Donbass and its expansion to other regions. Equally, the Kremlin sows panic among Ukrainian society and builds false justifications for a new wave of the offensive called by the Kremlin ""special operation for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine"".

This group will strengthen the efforts of the EU, the US and Great Britain to hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities in Ukraine"", it is mentioned on the official website of the US State Department.

Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that he had to take this decision to protect the inhabitants of Donbass from genocide. According to the head of state, the citizens of Donbass were subjected to punitive attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Russian leader, in particular, told about the atrocities of the Ukrainian nationalists"".
NARRATIVE: The West is investigating the ""atrocities"" of Ukrainian nationalists on the territory of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The news, which at first glance seems to provide information, is actually war propaganda, constructed by omitting some important fragments from the text of the State Department's communique. ""The initiative will directly support the efforts of the Ukrainian General Prosecutor's Office to document, preserve and analyze evidence regarding war crimes and other atrocities committed by members of the Russian forces in Ukraine.""
The Russian press does not mention anything about the atrocities of the Russian army in Ukraine, nor does it send a hyperlink to the press release in English, but retells it through the prism of its own false narratives, distributed during the last years.
""It is important to ensure that all those responsible for the terrible atrocities committed during the unprovoked Russian military aggression in Ukraine are brought to justice,"" said the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, who is involved in this initiative.
Therefore, the purpose of creating this crime investigation group is to hold accountable the Russian military who committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. The communiques and statements of Western officials do not mention anything about the atrocities of the Ukrainian nationalists.
Other Russian media outlets, including TASS, intentionally mistranslated the US State Department's press release, stating that ""war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine will be documented,"" removing any mention of Russia or the Russian military. .
Towards the end of the news, the false narratives about the genocide against Russian-speakers in Donbass, about Russia's special operation and about Ukrainian nationalists who committed war crimes in eastern Ukraine are repeated. In reality, Russia invaded Ukraine unprovoked on February 24, destroying towns, bombing military and civilian infrastructure, killing women, children and the elderly.
Some evidence (satellite images, drone footage) unequivocally attests that the Russian military committed war crimes in the Kiev region. Ukraine asked the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send investigators as soon as possible to gather evidence of war crimes.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives, according to which the French gendarmes will hide the traces of the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea, while the Ukrainian nationalists will shoot at civilians again. In April, the Russian press wrote that American experts believe that the news about the atrocities of the Russian military in Ukraine are an invention of Ukrainian propaganda. The propaganda narrative was also dismantled, according to which the UN admitted that the Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for military purposes, and Zelenski announces the organization of a new genocide of Russian speakers in Kharkiv and Donbass.

In reality, the mentioned localities have long been occupied by Russia, and the local council claims war crimes committed by the Russian military.
NEWS: Neo-Nazis from the ""Azov"" battalion established resistance points and barracks and also brought weapons to kindergartens in Mirnograd, Donetsk People's Republic and Borovaia, Kharkiv region. This was announced on Tuesday by the head of the Center of control of the national defense of the Russian Federation, colonel-general Mihail Mizintev.
The ""Neo-Nazis"" of the ""Azov"" battalion from Borovaia, Kharkiv region, founded barracks in the school building and in the Beriozka kindergarten and brought military equipment, heavy weapons, artillery and rockets to their territory. At the same time, civilians and children are kept with force in the basements,"" said Mizintev, who heads the Interdepartmental Coordination Center of the Russian Federation for Humanitarian Aid in Ukraine. [...] ""Armored vehicles and artillery were deployed in the immediate vicinity of residential areas,"" he added.
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian neo-Nazis are holding captive civilians from the Kharkiv region.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the towns in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions mentioned in the news distributed by the Russian media were occupied by the Russian military on April 13. That is why the actions described by the Russian colonel-general are impossible: deploying armored vehicles and artillery near schools, locking civilians in basements, establishing resistance points and barracks.
According to a press release from the Borovaia local council in the Kharkiv region, on April 27, the Russian occupiers entered the local school and kindergarten. After the Russian soldiers withdrew, the school was destroyed and looted, and they blamed the ""neo-Nazis"" of the ""Azov"" regiment. This regiment (which comes from a militia that had connections with the extreme right but was reorganized and integrated into the security forces of Ukraine for many years) was never present in Borovaia. The images posted by the local council show that the school and the kindergarten are destroyed, it being impossible to keep civilians in captivity in their premises or to use them as barracks or points of armed resistance.
Borovaia local council describes on its Facebook page every step of the occupation regime, mentioning the resistance of Ukrainians. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine admitted that the towns of Borovaia and Mirnograd are occupied by Russia, being located quite far from the front line.
As in the case of the city of Mariupol, the occupation authorities blame the Ukrainian army or the fighters of the ""Azov"" regiment, considered neo-Nazi by Russia, for the war crimes committed by the Russian military.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives, according to which Ukraine was preparing to attack the Donbass and masked its intentions by hiding soldiers in schools and hospitals, and Russia discovered nationalist concentration camps in eastern Ukraine.
In order to absolve Russia, the pro-Kremlin press wrote starting on February 24 that the Ukrainian military are neo-Nazis and commit war crimes against civilians in eastern and southern Ukraine. In reality, it is Russia that is bombing Ukrainian cities and has destroyed numerous civilian targets, including apartment buildings, schools, etc. In the Kiev region, the collection of evidence continues, with the support of some teams of experts from the EU, in order to hold Russia accountable for the war crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine.

It is the latest in a series of false narratives through which Russia tries to justify its aggression by saying that Ukraine would develop, with Western support, biological weapons.
NEWS: ""Ukrainian refugees are checked in the European Union if they are not sick with tuberculosis because it is known about the biological activity of NATO in Ukraine, said on May 18 during a press conference the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zakharova.
""Do you know which analyzes are primarily required of citizens who arrive in the EU member states from Ukraine? Tuberculosis tests? Why? Because they know what the NATO structures were dealing with there, they know very well,"" said the diplomat.
Previously, Maria Zaharova promised to report on new facts regarding the experiments in the biological laboratories of the USA in Ukraine. In particular, she will tell about the experiments on humans"".
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian refugees are checked in the EU if they are not sick with tuberculosis that comes from NATO laboratories.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the EU states did not introduce new customs controls for Ukrainians, but, on the contrary, liberalized the border crossing regime. Mothers passed with children who did not have passports. The requirement to present the anti-COVID-19 vaccination certificates has also been cancelled, the passports of farm animals s.a. no longer need to be presented. The new simplified border crossing procedures for Ukrainians have been published by the European Commission.
Also, it is allowed to stay on the territory of the EU for a longer period, Ukrainian citizens obtaining the right to work for a period of 9 months, which was impossible before. In the new rules for entering, finding or transiting the EU states, nothing is mentioned about tuberculosis testing.
Regarding the metanarrative about the laboratories in Ukraine where biological weapons were produced or developed, Veridica dismantled a series of fake news on this topic. In March, the Russian press wrote that the coronavirus was produced in secret laboratories in Ukraine. At the beginning of the invasion, Kremlin spokesmen declared that Russia had destroyed American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. In April, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine attacked Russian military positions with chemical and biological weapons, using military drones. In reality, the Russian government media and the Ministry of Defense in Moscow presented an agricultural drone from southern Ukraine as chemical and biological weapons!
The history of this false narrative is older and since 2020 the US embassy in Kiev has reacted to it by stating that there is no American secret laboratory on the territory of Ukraine. At the same time, in 2007 Ukraine ratified the Convention on the non-proliferation of biological weapons.
So far, Moscow has not presented any concrete proof of the existence of such laboratories, but it has justified the attack on Ukrainian cities by the need to destroy them.
The purpose of these propaganda narratives is to justify Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine, presenting them as a series of measures necessary to destroy biological weapons production laboratories. Publication / Media:

NEWS: The adviser to the Zelenski administration, Podoleak, proposed to organize a total genocide in the Kharkiv region, but also in the people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk until the word ""Russians"" will be definitively forgotten.
Kiev no longer hides the information about what Russia so often reminded the West and why German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was laughing. The adviser to the head of the Zelensky Administration, Podoleak, admitted directly to a television station that he wants a total genocide in the Kharkiv region, but also in the people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk until the word ""Russians"" is definitively forgotten.
I want the word ""Russian"" to be forgotten in the Kharkiv region, Podoleak said, quoted by Strana.ua. I want the word ""Russian"" to be forgotten in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
In addition, the Zelensky administration does not hide the fact that it wants to kill the members of the leadership of the people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. I mentioned that in this way the Ukrainian authorities get rid of people unsuitable for the Kiev regime. On August 31, 2018, the head of the DNR, Aleksandr Zaharcneko, was killed first in Donetsk, during an assassination attack.
NARRATIVE: Zelenski's adviser announces the organization of a genocide of Russian speakers in Kharkiv and Donbass
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Mihailo Podoliak, the advisor to the president of Ukraine, did not refer, in the statement broadcast by the national ICTV television channel, to the launch of an operation to ""cleanse"" the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Lugansk regions of Russian speakers. He did not pronounce the word ""genocide"".
Podoliak was asked to comment on the situation on the Russian-Ukrainian front and declared that he wants to see Ukraine freed from the Russian occupiers. Zelensky's adviser stated that Ukraine must ""be very tough with Russian collaborators and soldiers"". He said that Ukraine wants to liberate the regions of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson from the Russian invaders, adding that in these regions there must be forgot the word ""Russian"".
The target of Podoliak's speech is the Russian forces and their collaborators; there was no mention of the civilian population, regardless of whether it is Russian speakers or Ukrainian speakers. Moreover, a large part of the population of the regions seized by Moscow following the February 24 invasion fled from the path of the Russian forces, generally taking refuge to the west, in Ukraine and outside it. The population that did not succeed or did not want to flee did not accept the occupation; there are numerous reports from the Kherson area about the resistance of the population. Although Moscow tries to legitimize its invasion by saying that it is liberating a Russian-speaking population that no longer wants to be part of Ukraine, the mobilization of Ukrainians shows that the Russians are seen as an enemy by the majority of the population, which wants to stay in Ukraine. The brutality of the Russian forces, which can be seen in the bombing of numerous civilian targets, the summary executions of civilians, rapes, robberies - shows that these are the ones who treat the civilian population as an enemy.
The population remaining in the areas occupied by the Russians is seen as a hostage population and Kiev wants its release.
As regards the ""toughness"" towards the Russian forces and their Ukrainian collaborators, Kiev has repeatedly insisted that it respects the Geneva Conventions, in the case of the former, and the national legislation, in the case of the collaborators who, in any case, do not risk being sentenced to death because Ukraine has repealed the capital sentence.
The narrative regarding a ""genocide"" committed against Russian-speakers is not new, and its variants have been dismantled over time by Veridica. In March, the Russian press wrote that the UN supports the genocide directed against Russian-speakers in Ukraine, in November 2021 the news agencies from Moscow they wrote that Ukraine continues the genocide in Donbass with Turkish drones, and in September 2021 the central Russian television stations announced that the Ukrainian army could clean Donbass and Crimea of ​​the Russian-speaking population.

In reality, Russia has launched a real campaign of forced displacement of Ukrainians from the territories it controls. In addition, nine out of ten Ukrainians consider the Russian state an enemy.
NEWS: ""Up to now, over a million citizens of Ukraine have left for Russia and another 2.7 million have expressed their desire to move to the Russian Federation. This was stated by Aleksei Zaitev, deputy head of the Information and Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
""The Kiev authorities continue to block the evacuation of Ukrainian citizens to Russia. Despite this fact, over a million people have already left for our country, including 200,000 children.

Russia launched an operation to demilitarize Ukraine on February 24. President Vladimir Putin called the objective of this operation ""the protection of the people who were subjected to harassment and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years"". According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the armed forces are only hitting the military infrastructure and Ukrainian troops and have fulfilled already the main tasks of the first stage - have significantly reduced the fighting potential of Ukraine. The main goal of the operation, according to the Russian military department, is called the liberation of Donbass"".
NARRATIVE: Almost three million Ukrainians want to go to Russia, fleeing the ""atrocities"" of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the statements of Russian diplomats, quoted by RIA Novosti and distributed on various Telegram channels, are part of a war propaganda metanarrative, according to which most Ukrainians want to be freed from Russia or wish any price to reach the territory of the Russian state. In April, the Russian press wrote that 95% of Ukrainians are waiting to be released by Russia - a false narrative dismantled by Veridica.
The Ukrainians whom Russia describes as ""voluntary refugees"" are, rather, deported. According to the Plenipotentiary of the Ukrainian Parliament for Human Rights, Lyudmila Denisova, Russia has created ""filtration camps"" of citizens, forcing them to enter Russian territory over 1 ,2 million Ukrainians. In other words, it is not about 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees, but about people deported or forced to arrive in Russia.
International organizations have signaled various cases of deportations of Ukrainians unsuitable for Russia in the eastern regions. Journalistic investigations have shown that Ukrainians end up in Russia after Moscow destroyed their houses. Many of them try to reach the EU through Russia, but very few succeed.
According to sociological data, Ukrainians consider Russia to be their main enemy. The majority of Ukrainians do not want the Russians to be in their country and perceive the invasion as it is - an aggression and an unprovoked attack. The Russian military has committed a series of war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, which are documented with the support of international organizations.
According to a survey conducted by the ""Rating"" group, 9 out of 10 Ukrainians hate Russia and believe in Ukraine's victory in the war with the Russian aggressor. 89% of Ukrainians believe that Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, and see the war as a genocide against the Ukrainian people.

In reality, it is not about any mobilization; Ukraine only requested assistance to be able to support its security forces, which together have a force of one million people.
NEWS: The Ambassador of the Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) in Russia, Rodion Mirosnik, wrote on his Telegram channel about Ukraine's plans to mobilize a million people. Mirosnik linked Kiev's intention to call for a million soldiers to the US's desire to provide the Ukrainian side with $40 billion in aid, as well as financial assistance from Europe.
According to him, since the United States and Great Britain invest weapons, ammunition and money in the crisis in Ukraine, Kiev is obliged to pay with human beings. ""The United States and its allies have increased the amount of aid, Kiev must respond with a million soldiers!"" he explained.
The LNR ambassador added that the Ukrainian authorities are indifferent to their country, because they will not live in it.
NARRATIVE: Kiev mobilizes a million people in the army, paying with human beings for Western loans
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukraine has not announced that it will mobilize a million soldiers. The propaganda narrative is based on an intentional misinterpretation of the statement of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksii Reznikov, who said that the Ukrainian army needs support, equipment, food and more. ""It is necessary to provide the necessary things to the one million people who are fighting the enemy,"" said the head of the Ukrainian army.
The minister did not talk about mobilization, but only about the high expenses for the operation of the army. At the beginning of May, Oleksii Reznikov declared that over a million people are already active in the Ukrainian defense and security sector. He explained that the respective figure includes all employees, volunteers and collaborators of the armed forces, territorial defense units, the police, the national guard, the security service, etc. Being a fairly large number of people, Kiev faced certain difficulties in terms of supplying them with the necessary things (helmets, bulletproof vests, clothes).
Therefore, the narrative launched by the Russian press, according to which Ukraine is going to mobilize a million soldiers in response to Western financial assistance, is false. On the contrary, Kiev requests support from the West to support the efficient functioning of its defense forces, mobilized on February 24 following the war launched by Russia against Ukraine.
The Russian press also claims that ""the Ukrainian authorities are indifferent to their country, because they will not live in it"". The thesis is not supported by any argument or evidence. Moreover, it is contradicted by the reality on the ground - even when Kiev was in danger, the leadership of Ukraine refused to leave their city, even though it was directly targeted by Russian forces.

""Schools continue to be attacked and used for military purposes. Educational institutions throughout the country were hit by heavy artillery, they were subjected to airstrikes [...]"", Abdi said at a meeting of the UN Security Council.
According to the diplomat, schools are used as information centers, shelters, supply centers or for military purposes.
[...] Ukrainian militants and foreign mercenaries place their reference centers and weapons in educational institutions in the Ukrainian regions of Vinnitsa and Kharkiv"".
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for offensive purposes.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the UNICEF representative at the UN did not criticize Ukraine and did not accuse it of bombing its own schools or turning them into bridgeheads for launching offensives. In Omar Abdi's report, it is said that following the Russian aggression, Ukrainian families ended up ""in a real hell"", and the children had to drink water from puddles, hide from tanks and bombardments.
The UN report claims that Ukrainian schools are attacked by the Russian army, in the east of Ukraine every sixth educational institution has been destroyed. For this reason, education will not be able to be resumed too soon.
The Russian press did not mention anything about the accusations against Russia, but created a propaganda narrative by taking some of Omar Abdi's statements out of context. The UN expert does not blame Ukraine, but only Russia for the humanitarian catastrophe and war crimes.
The same arguments were used by the head of the UN, Antonio Guterres, who declared during the meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia started a real war against Ukraine under the pretext of its ""denazification"" and ""disarmament"", rejecting the arguments about the ""operation special"". This is also the position of the UN General Assembly, which condemned Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Veridica has already dismantled a propaganda narrative, according to which Vladimir Putin convinced the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, that the Ukrainian Nazis should be tried at the Criminal Court International.
Also, according to another propaganda narrative dismantled by Veridica and launched at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kiev deploys its soldiers in schools and hospitals, and Russia is forced to attack them wherever they are. Publication / Media:

In fact, fuels have become more expensive as a result of the global increase in hydrocarbon prices. In addition, the experts point out that the transport should have been gradually increased in price since the previous years, considering that the last adjustment of the tariffs was carried out in 2009.
NEWS: ""The PAS government did absolutely nothing to stop the increase in fuel prices, and because of this, public transport trips in the capital could become more expensive"". Alexander Odintov.
""Due to the inaction of PAS, diesel and gasoline ended up costing 28 and 29 lei. The Cabinet of Ministers is doing absolutely nothing to stop the increase in fuel prices. ANRE, which is led by the people appointed according to Plahotniuc, continues to operate and nobody does anything. Moreover, the Government says that it will not cancel the VAT for fuels, because they make money on our account. If we remove VAT and excise duty, fuel would cost less than 18 lei per liter. The government says that this money goes to the budget. That is, they make money on drivers, but also on municipal enterprises. In this context, we ask the Government, as a matter of urgency, to approve: a regulation according to which the free public transport trips in the municipality of Chisinau, for the 13 categories of state employees, should be compensated from the state budget. At the same time, a regulation should be approved regarding enterprises of social importance"", said Alexandr Odintov. NARRATIVE: The pro-European PAS government (Maia Sandu) bears the responsibility for all price increases, including those expected for public transport in the city of Chisinau (led by a former socialist leader).
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: The Republic of Moldova records the highest inflation in Europe - 27% in April, and the situation will continue to worsen, so that inflation will exceed 30% in the fall, according to the latest forecasts of the National Bank. The governor of the National Bank of Romania, Octavian Armasu, explained this by the large share in the consumption basket of food products, the price of which has increased a lot, but also by the fact that many tariffs have not been adjusted in time, and their increase currently contributes to the increase in inflation .
At the beginning of last week, the mayor of Chisinau, Ion Ceban, one of the former leaders of the Socialist Party and a critic of the government, announced that public transport fares will be increased 2-3 times, given that the last adjustment was made in 2009, and in the meantime, the prices of energy resources have increased and the municipality is suffering big losses.
One of the theses intensively promoted by the pro-Russian opposition in the Republic of Moldova is that the pro-European government, led by president Maia Sandu and the Action and Solidarity Party (PAS), is responsible for the price increase.
OBJECTIVE: To associate the pro-European government with galloping inflation and price increases in the chain.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Fuel prices are rising practically all over the world. It is a trend that started in the second half of 2021 in the context of the relaunch of the economy after the Coronovaris pandemic, which was amplified at the beginning of 2022, in the context of the war in Ukraine.
At the beginning of last week, according to specialized websites, gasoline and diesel in the Republic of Moldova were among the cheapest in Europe, costing approximately 1.4 euros per liter.
In the Republic of Moldova, gasoline and diesel prices are set daily (on working days) by the National Agency for Energy Regulation, and four of the five members of the institution's Board of Directors were appointed according to the previous governments.
The government partially subsidized gas and thermal energy bills during the cold period of the year for all consumers, including thanks to the money offered by the European Union.
Regarding the transport tariffs in Chisinau, experts say that they should have been gradually increased over the years, something that was not done because of political interests.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The prices of energy resources have increased a lot in the last year, the period that also coincides with the mandate of the current government from Chisinau. Publication / Media:

[...]
In the churches of Russia, the Gospel was read in the Ukrainian language at the Easter liturgy.
NARRATIVE: The Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church was sentenced to death on the territory of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The main espionage department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published at the end of April a list of ministers of the Russian Orthodox Church who support Russian propaganda and participate in ""informational-psychological operations"". According to the information posted on the website The main direction of espionage, the church girls received instructions from the Russian leadership to convince young people to sign contracts with the armed forces.
The main spy agency in Kiev claims that Russian priests ""pronounce Russian aggression and support genocide against the Ukrainian people"". Representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church will be held accountable, according to Ukrainian legislation.
On the website of the Main Directorate of Espionage of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, there is no mention of the death penalty - a basic message of the propaganda narratives promoted by the Russian media.
In Ukraine, the death penalty has been banned since 2000, being replaced by life imprisonment in the Criminal Code. According to art. 64-81 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, after the execution of 20 years of the sentence, the persons who received such sentences can ask the President for pardon. The death penalty did not exist even during martial law, despite the contrary claims of Russian propagandists.
Metropolitan Onufrie of Kiev, the head of the Ukrainian church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate, criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin in March, asking him to ""immediately put an end to the fratricidal war"".
Russia did not react for a while to this message of Metropolitan Onufrie of Kiev because it contradicted the official narratives regarding the persecution of Russian speakers and Orthodox by Ukraine. Now, the metropolitan's critical reaction is explained by his fear of not being executed by the Ukrainian authorities. Publication / Media:

The narrative aims to demonize the opponent, the Ukrainian army.
NEWS: ""At the headquarters of the Ukrainian artillery command near the town of Trehizbenka, traces of black magic were detected: followers of forces from the other world tried to ""sanctify"" their weapons and left traces of blood, reports the correspondent of RIA Novosti .
Military unit A4472 was located in that headquarters. The Satanist seal was noticed on the walls, reminiscent of Hollywood movies about unclean forces.
""It is a magical symbol, made of several intersecting lines. It is difficult to say what this symbolizes, here you can see the inverted anarchist symbol, part of the SS symbol, the Sieg rune, clearly visible on the left side of the circle, and the Hebrew letter Zein, written in German, which means ""sword"" or ""the weapon"", said culturologist Ecaterina Dais for RIA Novosti. It is ""the magic seal of the forces of darkness,"" she added.
She noticed that the symbol consisted of a continuous line, which also demonstrates its occult character. ""In biblical Hebrew, Zein means ""sword"" and the verb ""lezein"" means ""weapon"". They probably did a ritual to strengthen their weapons or ""asked for more weapons"". consider Dais.
Among the command's instructions, in the building, was found a communique of Ukrainian fighters in which they recounted the losses suffered in Donbass. Traces of blood were found on the document, a fact that has not been observed in other cases"".
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian Nazi military practices satanic rituals to help them in battle.
OBJECTIVE: The narrative aims to demonize the opponent.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: One of the main narratives promoted by the Kremlin to justify the invasion of Ukraine is that the country must be denazified; moreover, ever since it attacked Ukraine for the first time, in 2014, Russia has denounced the presence of so-called fascist elements in the neighboring country. This narrative is also supported by fake news that refer to mysticism and occult rituals, which the Ukrainian military would practice, with reference to the interest in occultism of some Nazi leaders, especially from the SS.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russian propaganda has resorted to various stories, especially about the Ukrainian soldiers from the Azov battalion. The Russian press writes that the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Mariupol would worship the statue of the god of lightning Perun, but also other Scandinavian deities (under the influence of far-right Europeans), that they would practice various rituals, from the witches' sabbath, to the traditions of American special forces soldiers. Russian television also reported that a group of American soldiers, ""Satan's mercenaries"", would fight in Ukraine. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion in 2022, video clips appeared on social networks - later dismantled as fakes - in which characters dressed in uniforms military and who present themselves as fighters of the Azov battalion would have crucified a young man. The most famous fake news of this kind was the one about the crucifixion of a child, which appeared back in 2014, when Russia started the war in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine .
Claims regarding the connection between the Ukrainian forces, the extreme right and the occult were made recently - and widely taken up by Russian channels - also by Lara Logan, the journalist and war correspondent associated in recent years with the promotion of conspiracy theories and false information, which led to her dismissal by several media organizations, including Fox News, which does not always distance itself from such theories.
The fake news about Satanism refers, indirectly, to the way in which Russia is positioned as an Orthodox Christian city under siege, a defender of traditional values ​​opposed to those that the Church denounces as sins.
The story with the satanic rituals shows, therefore, many similarities with other fake news spread in the last 8 years by Russian propaganda and, according to their pattern, does not present conclusive evidence. In addition, no independent source has found the existence of any Satanist current within the Ukrainian forces, neither after the launch of the large-scale Russian invasion, nor before it.

The false narrative was launched even by the spokesperson of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, being multiplied by the Russian government press.
NEWS: In Ukraine, alongside the units of the ""Azov"" regiment (against the soldiers against whom a criminal case was filed in the Russian Federation), mercenaries from Israel are fighting, said the spokesperson of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova.
[...] The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that Israel cannot ignore this. ""I saw the video, the invoices, the materials"", explained Zaharova.
Previously, the Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, said that he expects an apology from Russia for the statement of his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to Israel, Anatoly Viktorov, was called to the Foreign Ministry to provide explanations. On Sunday, Lavrov, in an interview given to the Italian television company ""Mediaset"", said that a nazification process is taking place in Ukraine and the captured soldiers of the nationalist battalions wear tattoos with neo-Nazi symbols. At the same time, Lavrov underlined to the question, the words of Volodymyr Zelensky, who denies Nazism in his country, as he himself is a Jew. The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said that ""this means absolutely nothing"" because ""Jewish scholars say that the most ardent anti-Semites are, of usually, also Jews"".
NARRATIVE: Mercenaries from Israel fight in Ukraine against Russia alongside the soldiers of the ""Azov"" group
CONTEXT: After the start of Russia's war against Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky declared that an International Legion, composed of volunteers, would be established, which would support the defensive efforts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Kiev has announced that many Russian citizens have registered in this International Legion.
The Russian press wrote in the last 2 months that foreign mercenaries are fighting in Ukraine, discrediting Kiev's initiative to create a group of military volunteers. Veridica has already dismantled a false narrative, according to which the US will send former soldiers of the national army from Afghanistan to Ukraine. The Kremlin is looking for justifications in front of its own citizens, but also the international community, for the fact that Russia is the one that calls on mercenaries (Wagner group, Syrian fighters). At the same time, Moscow seeks to show that Ukraine's resistance is due to foreign support, not to its own military.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After Israel apologized to Russia for the statement of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow, it became another target of propaganda and disinformation messages. In this sense, Moscow combined two previous false narratives: the one about the atrocities of the soldiers of the ""Azov"" regiment accused of being neo-Nazis, and another one about mercenaries from Israel fighting in Ukraine.
Russian propaganda deepened Lavrov's rather confused message by launching a much larger false narrative, according to which the Israeli military is fighting side by side with Ukrainian neo-Nazis! From here it would result that Jews and neo-Nazis fight against the Russian military in Ukraine, the image of Russia as a besieged fortress being strengthened in the eyes of public opinion.
In reality, Ukraine offered an exhaustive explanation regarding the status of the military who voluntarily fight on its territory according to international law. The MFA in Kyiv mentioned that these are foreign citizens in the Armed Forces of Ukraine based on voluntary agreements, according to the Geneva Convention of 1949. They are not remunerated and must enjoy fair treatment if they become prisoners of war. war.
In the Russian-language press of the Jewish community in Ukraine, images were even published of Jewish volunteers in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who are by no means professional mercenaries. Many of them are not even citizens of Israel.
Therefore, there are no foreign mercenaries on the territory of Ukraine, but volunteers, including Jews, Russians, and Belarusians, who signed up in the International Legion under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
Russia did not present any evidence about the presence of mercenaries from Israel in Ukraine or their collaboration with fighters from the ""Azov"" regiment; simply, the Russians claimed that there were certain invoices that would prove their claims, in a style reminiscent of numerous other propaganda campaigns based on fake news and disinformation.
In addition, Israel emphasized that it will not get involved in any way in the Russian-Ukrainian war, stating only that the majority of officials supported the need to increase the military and civilian support provided to Ukraine, arousing Moscow's displeasure. Israel is forced to be cautious by its national interests, given the fact that Russia is present in Syria, a country where the Israeli air force operates regularly to stop the formation of Iranian bases that threaten Israel's security. Russia has not interfered so far to prevent Israeli operations in Syria. On the other hand, there are also important economic ties between Israel and Russia, and part of the population of the former is originally from Russia. Publication / Media:

,,[...] We are willing to participate as volunteers in the special operation in Ukraine. We believe in our leader, we believe in victory. Thank you for the clean and peaceful sky,"" the appeal states.
The participants in the meeting called Russia a leading state, with a very high economic and defensive potential, led by a strong and determined commander-in-chief.""
NARRATIVE: Crimean Tatars support Russia's military actions on the territory of Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Crimean Tatars have repeatedly criticized the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation, condemning the annexation of the peninsula in 2014. Due to disobedience and protests, Crimean Tatars are politically persecuted, imprisoned, and a series of cultural associations were closed.
The Mejlis is the representative body of the Crimean Tatars, which functions according to the model of a parliament. After Crimea was occupied by Russia, the leaders of this national council began to be persecuted, and the president of the Mejlis, Refat Ciubarov, was forbidden to enter the territory of the peninsula.
The propaganda narrative launched by the pro-Kremlin media was criticized by Refat Ciubarov on his Facebook page. He mentioned that the Russian authorities forcibly gathered students of the Crimean University of Engineering and Pedagogy and employees of the education system who voted on a decision elaborated in the offices in Moscow.
""The sole purpose for which the FSB of the Russian Federation organized this gathering is to mimic the support of the Crimean Tatars for Putin's policy and the special operation against Ukraine. Through these actions, the Russian secret services are trying again, but without any results, to deceive the world, demonstrating that the Tatars are, in reality, loyal to the policy of the occupying state and to President Putin,"" stated Ciubarov.
The leader of the Crimean Tatars mentioned that Russia continues to persecute the representatives of the community it represents, replacing them with artificial assemblies and invented leaders.
On April 19, another Crimean Tatar leader, Emil Ziadinov, was sentenced to 17 years in prison, accused of organizing terrorist acts on the territory of the peninsula. The Mejlis considered this to be a fabricated file. Ukraine has repeatedly discussed the issue of human rights violations in the occupied peninsula at the UN.
It should be noted that the Russian propaganda narrative was launched after the Mejlis demanded at the end of March the return of the Crimean peninsula, calling it ""a mandatory condition"" in the peace negotiations with Russia.
""The Council of Crimean Tatars starts from the principle that the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine in its internationally recognized borders, including the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, must be a mandatory condition for the organization of official negotiations between Ukrainian representatives and the aggressor country, the Russian Federation "", according to the leader of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis.
Starting with 2014, the Tatars, along with other ethnic groups from Crimea, were recruited into the Russian armed forces. Veridica has already written that two notifications, signed by the NGO Crimean Human Rights Group, were sent to the Prosecutor's Office of the International Criminal Court. They contain evidence of the involvement of officials of the occupying state and its administration in organizing and carrying out illegal recruitment campaigns in the peninsula. The Russian authorities even opened 14 criminal cases in Crimea for evading civilians from military conscription. Publication / Media:

NEWS: The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation announced that Ukraine is preparing a new challenge in Lisiansk. According to the representative of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the head of the National Defense Control Center, colonel-general Mihail Mizintev, the Ukrainian authorities are preparing another terrible challenge in Lisiyansk.

[...]
This scenario, which is cynical, primarily towards its own people, as towards the dead Ukrainian soldiers, repeats the atrocities of the Nazis during the Great War for the Defense of the Fatherland"", comments Mihail Mizintev.
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian army will stage a new massacre following the model of those in Bucea or Borodianka.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The statement of the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Russia is part of a series of similar statements, disinformation and fake news thrown on the market with the aim of attributing responsibility for the war crimes committed by the Russian forces to the Ukrainian side. Nothing is mentioned about Bucea or Borodianka, but it is implied that the Russian general is considering ""staging a new massacre"" after the cases in the Kiev region. Some evidence (satellite images, drone footage) unequivocally attests that the Russian military are those who massacred the civilians in Bucea, a fact confirmed by numerous testimonies documented by the international press, organizations for the defense of human rights and investigators in the initial phases of the investigations that are still ongoing
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media, according to which American experts believe that the massacre in Bucea is an invention of ""Ukrainian propaganda"", and the French gendarmes will hide the traces of the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea. During April Russian propaganda distributed both false narratives in parallel, although they exclude each other: on the one hand, the West wants to hide the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea, on the other hand, the massacre in Bucea is a stage.
Colonel General Mihail Mizintev's statement deepens the second false narrative about the crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine. In reality, no corpses or destroyed equipment were brought to Lisiciansk, a town in the Donbass area.
The head of the Luhansk State Military Administration, Serghei Gaidai, reacted to this propaganda message, saying that no body was found in the city. He wrote on Facebook that ""the occupiers want to hide their own crimes with such information and blame the Armed Forces of Ukraine"". Gaidai also added that the Russian soldiers are opening fire with artillery on the town of Lisiyansk, which means that they could many civilians will be killed. Then, the Russian propaganda will again blame the ""Ukrainian propaganda"" that staged the massacre. Publication / Media:

The false narrative is picked up by the Russian press, which is involved in an effort to ensure public support for the so-called ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
NEWS: The Ministry of Defense of Russia announces that there was a chemical attack on the positions of the Russian forces in Ukraine. The attack was carried out with the help of a drone, announced on Saturday the head of the Radiological, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. He stated that the Armed Forces of Ukraine dropped ampoules from drones that, in the event of an explosion, released toxic substances.
The content of these ampoules is researched at Laboratory 27 of the Scientific Center of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, accredited by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
[...]
Kirillov communicated that on March 9, in the Kherson region, the intelligence departments of the Russian Armed Forces found three deadly armed drones, with 30-liter containers and spraying equipment. The head of the Radiological, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces claims that in January 2022 the Armed Forces of Ukraine acquired 50 such drones, which can be used for chemical and biological attacks.
[...]
""So, in an attempt to discredit the special military operation of the Russian army, the regime in Kiev, at the initiative of the American administration, could apply in the shortest possible time a scenario that will cause the death of tens of thousands of citizens of Ukraine, but also a ecological and humanitarian catastrophe,"" the general emphasized.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine attacks Russian military positions with chemical and biological weapons, and tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens will be killed.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russia does not present any concrete evidence when it accuses Ukraine of having used chemical or biological weapons. Moreover, according to the press release of the Ministry of Defense, the Russian general spoke about a possible attack and risks of using chemical and biological weapons by Ukraine in the future, while the headlines of the Russian media show that these attacks have already taken place .
Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov's statements do not prove either that Ukraine has chemical or biological weapons, nor that there have been attacks with such munitions.
Drones with sprayers, discovered by Russia in the Kherson region, about which the Russian press also wrote, do not represent chemical or biological weapons, but are used in agriculture. The southern regions of Kherson, Odesa and Nicolaev are considered important agricultural areas, and Agras T30 drones are used to monitor plantations and spray crops. Such drones are also used in Romania, and videos about their operation are published on YouTube.
Therefore, the Russian government press and the Ministry of Defense in Moscow presented an agricultural drone from the south of Ukraine as a chemical and biological weapon. Moreover, this false narrative is superimposed on others, dismantled by Veridica, according to which the Russian army identified and destroyed 13 laboratories in Ukraine where the biological weapon was produced. According to these false narratives, Russia is forced to bomb Ukrainian cities ""to save humanity"".
In fact, it is the Ukrainian side that has repeatedly expressed its fear that its forces could be attacked with weapons of mass destruction. The US representative at the OSCE stated that chemical weapons were already used by Russia in Mariupol. American diplomat Michael R. Carpenter declared that Ukraine and OSCE experts must collect evidence from Donbass that proves the use of chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol, this being a war crime.
On the day when Michael R. Carpenter stated that Russia used chemical munitions in Ukraine, Moscow massively distributed in its own media the narrative that the authorities in Kiev threaten the civilian population with chemical and biological weapons.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Center for Combating Disinformation within the National Security and Defense Council in Kyiv assessed the statements of the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Russia as false.
""These messages are a component of the informational-psychological operation of the Russian Federation, which aims to create panic among Ukrainians, but also to put pressure on the international community to reduce the level of support for Ukraine"", according to the Center for Combating disinformation.

The narrative is not based on any research and is related to the war propaganda used by Russia.
NEWS: Residents of the regions of southern Ukraine, liberated by the nationalists, have admitted that they want the respective territories to join Russia as soon as possible, the adviser to the president of Crimea for informational policy told RIA Novosti. According to him, people fear a return of the nationalists and want to know what their future status will be. The statement was made by Kriucikov after visiting the city of Berdiansk, controlled by the Russian military.
[...] ,,People demand a quick solution to the problem of the annexation of the territories from the south of Ukraine to Russia. They want union with Russia,"" said the adviser to the president of the region.
Previously, the inhabitants of the Zaporizhia region requested a temporary accession to the People's Republic of Donetsk. Starting from February 17, the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics announced the escalation of the situation by Ukraine. Civilians were evacuated.
NARRATIVE: Residents of southern Ukraine fear the return of the nationalists and request to join Russia.
CONTEXT: Starting from February 24, military actions are taking place in the south of Ukraine. Moscow met fierce resistance from the military, but also from Ukrainian civilians, who do not want to live under foreign occupation. For this reason, Russia tried to intimidate the local intellectual and political elite, simultaneously launching false narratives about the desire of the ""liberated"" Ukrainians to be attached to Russia. Veridica has already dismantled a propaganda narrative, according to which the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye requested joining the People's Republic of Donetsk.
OBJECTIVE: Convincing public opinion in Russia that the ""special operation"" is successfully taking place by presenting invented requests of the residents of Ukraine to be protected by Ukrainian nationalists and to be joined to the Russian Federation.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Neither the media nor the representative of the Russian authorities in the annexed Crimea presents any evidence when they report on the desire of the residents of southern Ukraine to be territorially annexed to Russia. On the contrary, the residents of Melitopol, Berdiansk, Kherson and other localities in the south of Ukraine protested after they were occupied by Russia, and Volodymyr Zelensky mentioned in his speeches ""the heroic deeds of the unruly Ukrainians"". The civilians came out in the way of the tanks and Russian armored vehicles, school and business directors refused to comply with the orders of the occupation regime.
The entire international community was amazed by these protests of Russian speakers in the east and south of Ukraine, who opposed the military actions of the Russian Federation. RIA Novosti writes that the representative of Crimea came to the conclusion that Ukrainians want to join Russia after visiting Berdiansk, the city where protests against Russian aggression took place for several days in a row. People chanted ""Berdiansk is Ukraine"" and ""stop the Russian aggression"".
According to sociological surveys, conducted in March 2022 in the territories controlled by Ukraine, 9 out of 10 Ukrainians in the south of the country consider Russia an enemy. Also, the Ukrainians in the south of the country believe in the victory of Ukraine in the war started by Moscow.
The statement of the adviser of the president of Crimea for informational policy, Oleg Kriucikov, in fact prepares the public opinion in Russia for an escalation of the conflict, being false justifications of a new wave of the offensive, already underway, called by the Kremlin, a ""special demilitarization operation"" and denazification of Ukraine"". They are also trying to convince public opinion in Russia that the ""special operation"" is taking place successfully and is supported by Ukrainians. Publication / Media:

Zelenski explained that this conflict was initially planned to take place between Ukraine and Russia. At the same time, Zelensky emphasized, it is ""difficult to prepare alone"" for a war with such a powerful state and that is why ""Ukraine wanted to join NATO"". ""That's why we wanted NATO. That is why we stabilized the situation in Ukraine. That's why I needed strong leadership within my team. That's why we fought with some political groups inside our state"", declared the Ukrainian leader.
He added that the military confrontation was initiated by Ukraine ""a long time"" before the launch of Russia's special operation for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. According to Zelensky, Ukraine had to prepare in time and especially needed money and armament.
NARRATIVE: Zelenski admitted that it was Ukraine that started the conflict with Russia
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The statements of the president of Ukraine are taken out of context and specially arranged to illustrate the theses of Russia's propaganda and disinformation narratives in the context of the war that broke out on February 24. The interview published by the BBC is entitled ""This is not war, this is genocide"". Volodymyr Zelenskiy stated, in fact, that he knew in advance of Russia's intentions to start a war against Ukraine, that is why he had to prepare for the organization a resilient defense. He said nothing about any attack on Russia or about the intention to enter into a conflict with Moscow, but instead accused the Kremlin of seeking war in recent years.
""We knew that Russia could attack us at any moment, because the war has been going on since 2014. That's why we wanted to join NATO. That is why we stabilized the situation in Ukraine. That's why I needed strong leadership within my team. That is why we fought with some political groups within our state funded by Russia. We started this war early,"" said Zelenskiy.
The words ""we started this war early"", which referred to the protection of the internal political and informational space of Ukraine, were presented in the Russian press as ""a recognition"" by President Zelensky of Kiev's bellicose intentions.
In the interview given to the BBC, Zelenski dismantles a series of false narratives by Russian officials and the government media about Ukraine, which would have sought to go to war with Russia. ""During the first two years of the presidency, I did everything I could to meet with them. To negotiate with the Russians, to end the war with them in the east of the country. It was my emotional mission, my humanitarian mission, which I wanted to complete successfully,"" Zelensky said, accusing Russia of never seeking peace, but only ways to escalate the conflict and occupy Ukraine.
In fact, Ukraine proposed to join NATO not to attack Russia, but on the contrary, to defend itself against it. NATO is a defensive alliance, and according to Art. 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, collective defense is triggered if a member is attacked, not if he attacks someone. Ukraine included in the country's Constitution, in 2019, the provisions on Euro-Atlantic integration precisely because it needed a collective defense format, understanding that a war with Russia would be a difficult task for its armed forces.

NEWS: It seems that the leadership in Kiev has forgotten about Kharkiv, consoling itself with the idea that Russia will take it. The Ukrainian authorities have allocated one billion hryvnias for the restoration of the affected regions. We do not see the Kharkiv region in this list, despite the fact that it was affected more than Sumi and especially Zhitomir.
The answer to the question ""why?"" is quite simple - Kharkiv is not among the government's priorities, as is South-Eastern Ukraine. The Kiev regime is beginning to understand that it cannot keep these regions in its component and sees no point to spend money on them.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine does not rebuild Kharkiv, knowing that it will join Russia.

The Telegram channel ""Z news of the rebels from Novorossia"" has over 300 thousand subscribers.
OBJECTIVE: Discourage the Ukrainian population's resistance to Russian aggression.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Telegram channel interprets the Kiev government's announcement biasedly, saying that the authorities have, in fact, given up some territories. Some explanations of Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Smigal, who dismantles this false narrative, are omitted. According to Smigal, Kiev is working on renovating the infrastructure in four Ukrainian regions liberated by the Armed Forces. The Ukrainian regions that are not completely liberated (Kharkov, Kherson, Donetk, Lungask and others) or where military actions are taking place have not been put on the list because the works cannot be carried out there. In fact, it is not even logical to renovate the civilian objectives that in a few days can be bombed again. Denis Smigal declared that only the first tranche of the financial aid intended for reconstruction was allocated, and the works in other regions will be launched immediately after the respective territories are liberated.
According to the information of the Armed Forces and the online maps of the combat actions, military confrontations continue in several localities in the Kharkiv region, and a number of localities are being bombed by the Russian army.
The statement according to which Ukraine would have been willing to cede certain territories is false. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly declared for both the Ukrainian and international media that Ukraine will fight for every square meter of territory and for every person.
For these reasons, the purpose of this propaganda narrative is to discourage Ukrainian resistance to Russia's attempts to occupy the Kharkiv region and the south-eastern areas of the country. It is also intended to create a false impression among Russian-speaking readers that Russia's victory in this war seems to be ""inevitable"".

the answer to the question ""why?"" it's quite simple - kharkov is not among the government's priorities, like south-eastern Ukraine. the regime in kiev is beginning to understand that it cannot keep these regions in its composition and sees no point in spending money on them."

NARRATIVE: The inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye request to join the People's Republic of Donetsk.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The video clip, quoted by the Russian press and made by a journalist from Donbass, does not include any reference, any demand or statement about the desire of the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye to be attached to the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk. It is a report published on Telegram, with over 215 thousand views, which, in fact, does not even include footage from the city of Zaporozhye, but from the village of Rozivka, located 170 kilometers from the regional center of Zaporozhye. It is a locality near the Mariupol district, controlled by the Russian army. Therefore, the title and content of this propaganda narrative are false: the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic was not in the city of Zaporozhye, but in a village far from it, and no one there requested to join the separatist republic.
In fact, Denis Pusilin's visit to the city of Zaporozhye is impossible at the moment. While the village of Rozivka is occupied by the Russian army, the city of Zaporozhye is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the report of the Ukrainian army, in the Zaporozhye region, the localities of Zatisia, Malinivka, Vesele, Zeleni Gai, Cervone and others were liberated by the Russian invaders.
The purpose of this propaganda narrative is to prepare the public opinion in Russia for a future escalation of the conflict in Donbass, as false justifications for a new wave of the offensive called by the Kremlin ""special operation for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine"" have been built.

NEWS: ""After the beginning of the Russian special operation in Ukraine, in the Republic of Moldova the trust in NATO and in the Western structures suddenly decreased. Almost 30 years after the fall of the USSR, international organizations surrounded the country like a spider, telling Moldovans how the West can help them live better and how it will protect them from ""Russian aggression"". Today, despite these words , citizens with a sober mind begin to understand that NATO is not a reliable partner, but a threat to the security of the state.
[...]
People see that NATO has abandoned Ukraine, and they understand that it will also abandon Moldova, Romania, and all those who will come into conflict with Russia, and our country will become a battlefield for foreign interests."" NARRATIVE: NATO is not a reliable partner and will not ensure the security of its own members in the event of an attack from Russia.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is considered the most vulnerable country in the region in terms of a potential armed conflict. With a small territory and an underfunded army, it also faces a separatist conflict in the eastern region, which is led by a pro-Moscow regime supported by the Kremlin and where Russian military troops and ammunition are stationed.
The approach of the Republic of Moldova to the EU has been viewed critically by Moscow and by pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau, who, especially lately, have been sending alarmist messages about the possibility of the Republic of Moldova joining NATO, or the use of its territory by NATO .
Narratives about the preparation of the Republic of Moldova for a war against Russia, its involvement in military conflicts, the use of infrastructure by NATO to support Ukraine in the war with Russia have intensified in the last period of time, the aim being to fuel the citizens' fears and negative attitude against NATO.
OBJECTIVE: To present NATO as a weak alliance, which is unable to defend its own members, suggesting, at the same time, that Russia is (much more) powerful from a military point of view.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, only one survey was conducted in which citizens were asked about the option of joining NATO. Almost 22% declared that they would vote for joining NATO, in case of a referendum. Their number is decreasing compared to the summer of last year, when a third would have opted for. The decrease in the intention to vote for joining NATO occurred gradually, starting with August 2021, and is more related to the reduction of trust in the government of the pro-Europeans from the Action and Solidarity Party, who came to power after the elections in July 2021. A proof in this sense, trust in NATO has also increased previously with the elections won by center-right parties/politicians.
NATO did not ""leave Ukraine alone"", because it had no obligation towards it, the country not being a member of the Alliance. Before launching the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia asked for guarantees that this country would not be received in NATO, precisely because it knows that, once accepted into the Alliance, Ukraine would be protected. The very fact that Russia decided to attack Ukraine, but not smaller states like the Baltic states, is a clear demonstration of the fact that NATO represents the security guarantee of its members , under the conditions that Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that an attack against a member state is an attack against all.
NATO has supplemented the troops and defense capacity of the states on its eastern flank, especially in Romania, Poland and the Baltic States. Leaders of the organization, including the vice president of the USA, Kamala Harris, in Bucharest, gave assurances that NATO will defend each of its members.
Finally, although NATO refused Ukraine's request to ensure a no-fly zone, because it wants to avoid a conflict with the Russian Federation, the Alliance expressed its solidarity with Kiev and numerous member states delivered it ammunition and equipment in worth billions of euros.

NEWS: The events in Bucea are an episode of Ukrainian propaganda, said the former foreign policy advisor to the leadership of the Republican Party in the US Senate, James Jatras. ""We must not trust Kiev's information [...]"". According to him, any statement about atrocities must not be taken seriously without an official investigation. It is paradoxical that Kiev is not interested in carrying out an investigation. ""It is more convenient for Ukraine to get some immediate results and continue the propaganda actions,"" said Jatras.
[...] After the representatives of the SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] arrived in the city and the journalists from the West started to promote this fake news about the massacre of civilians by the Russian military.
NARRATIVE: American experts believe that the Bucea massacre is an invention of ""Ukrainian propaganda""
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: A series of publications from Russia (Novostivl.ru, Izvestia, Vm.ru, 9111.ru, 36on.ru s.a.) quote James Jatras and generalize by stating that the position expressed by him towards the massacre in Bucea , which coincides with that of the Kremlin, is that of the US experts.
The entire international community was shocked by the atrocities in Bucea, documented by dozens of journalists from Western countries.
The town in the Kiev region was liberated by the Ukrainian army, which discovered a large number of corpses dressed in civilian clothes, many showing signs of summary executions and torture. President Volodymyr Zelenski traveled to Bucea and denounced the actions of the Russians from there: ""They are war crimes and will be recognized by the world as genocide"". Zelenski added: ""You are here and you can see what happened. We know that thousands of people were killed and tortured, limbs broken, women were raped and children killed"".
Russia denies having committed war crimes in Bucea, emphasizing that the images from the Kiev region are fake, and the news about the massacre of civilians are elements of ""Ukrainian propaganda"". To convince the public opinion in Russia that Moscow has not committed war crimes In Ukraine, Russian propaganda resorts to quoting convenient experts from abroad, whose opinions are presented as the opinion of all scientists or as the official position of a state.
This time, James Jatras was cited, who was invited to Ren TV to create the illusion that the West supports the Russian version of the presentation of events in Ukraine. This political scientist is permanently invited to Russian government stations such as RT or Sputnik, openly promoting the Kremlin's narratives. James Jatras is used by Russian propaganda to illustrate their own narratives, as in the case of other Western ""experts"" who have served the Kremlin in recent years.
Analyzing the satellite images, The New York Times came to the conclusion that many civilians were killed 3 weeks before the liberation of the city of Bucea from the Ukrainians. American journalists showed how the bodies appeared in Bucea in mid-March and were there until the arrival of the Ukrainian army. The Russian press ignores such analyzes of major publications and only quotes a convenient American expert, presenting him as an indisputable analytical voice.
It is also not true that Ukraine would not want an investigation. Veridica has already written about the initiative of the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Dmitro Kuleba, who asked the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send their investigators to Bucea as soon as possible to gather evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russian troops.
About the crimes committed by the Russian soldiers, he wrote on the official Facebook page and the town hall of Bucea on March 6: ""the enemy continues to attack houses, cars, kill civilians, even children, rob shops"".
The US President, Joe Biden, requested the opening of a trial for war crimes against his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, following the assassinations in Bucea. ""You may remember that I was criticized in the past for calling Putin a war criminal. Well, the truth is that you saw what happened in Bucea. He is a war criminal. But we need to gather more information,"" Biden said. Publication / Media:

In reality, the USA has not sent and will not send soldiers to the territory of Ukraine in the context of the war with Russia.
NEWS: The US is preparing to send former soldiers of the national army from Afghanistan to Ukraine, according to RIA Novosti, citing its own sources. Washington will send about 400 soldiers to the area of ​​military actions. Military personnel will receive American weaponry.
[...] The soldiers of the National Army from Afghanistan were evacuated to the USA in the summer of 2021 after the Taliban came to power (""Taliban"" - terrorist movement banned on the territory of Russia). At the moment several thousand people, who they used to be at the American military bases in Afghanistan, they live in refugee centers.
According to the sources, these former soldiers paid by the USA may be drawn into the war in Ukraine, being threatened that they could be deported from the USA. They also promised the military a fee of thousands of dollars. [...] Currently, Russia is carrying out a special operation to de-Nazify and demilitarize Ukraine.
NARRATIVE: The US sends to Ukraine Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban in the West.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On February 24, Russia launched a war against Ukraine under the pretext of its ""denazification"" and ""disarmament"". Before invading Ukraine, Moscow had asked for guarantees that the country would never join NATO (although it is its sovereign right) and that NATO would withdraw from the member states of Eastern Europe. At the same time, Russia has been running a disinformation campaign for years in which it accuses NATO of alleged aggressive intentions towards it, despite the fact that the Alliance is a defensive one. Practically, after the Yugoslav wars (which ended following the efforts made by NATO and the West), the only country that threatened, through war, the security of Europe is the Russian Federation. Beyond the military aggressions, Russia also unleashed a real informational war, to which were added attempts to destabilize Western societies (by influencing the electoral process).
At the same time, Russia issued imperial claims in the ex-Soviet space, where it supported separatist entities and made efforts to block the democratization and rapprochement of the former Soviet republics with the West. The first invasion of Ukraine was launched, moreover, in 2014, after the Yanukovych regime was removed - which, also under pressure from Moscow, had given up at the last moment to sign the Association Agreement with the EU - and the country announced its intention to resume the European course.
In February, Russia attacked Ukraine with overwhelming forces, which managed to resist, causing massive losses to the invading forces, so that Russia was forced to turn to Wagner mercenaries, Chechen fighters and mercenaries recruited from Syria. However, the Ukrainian army is outnumbered on several levels - it doesn't have as many people, as much equipment, and it is outnumbered especially in terms of aviation and artillery. Kiev has launched numerous calls for help, especially to obtain a no-fly zone to eliminate the threat to Russian aviation, but the West cannot take the risk of a conflict with Russia, so it has limited itself to providing support by pressuring Moscow with sanctions and delivering to Ukraine certain types of light weapons, ammunition, humanitarian aid and funds. At the same time, some Western countries allowed their citizens to volunteer in Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to demonstrate to the readers that in Ukraine there is a conflict between Russia and the West, led by the USA, which is mobilizing foreign human resources to fight against the Russophones.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the US has not sent and does not intend to send troops to Ukraine. The Afghan National Army was largely disbanded in 2021 after the withdrawal of NATO troops. The soldiers from Afghanistan have reached the neighboring states or have gone over to the side of the Taliban. Some soldiers were evacuated to the USA. Washington reported at the beginning of this year that all the evacuated Afghans were distributed among different American states, and some of them were integrated into the American society within some government programs.
American President Joe Biden has repeatedly declared that he will not send the army to Ukraine, because this decision could generate a Third World War.
There is no official statement regarding the recruitment of Afghans or the sending to Ukraine of soldiers with combat experience from Afghanistan. The subject is presented as a real one and exists only in the informational space in Russia to convince the internal public opinion that Moscow is a ""savior"" of the Russian speakers in Ukraine from the ""future aggressors from Afghanistan"".
Last year, in Great Britain, the idea of ​​establishing Afghan units, modeled after the Gurkha units, made up of Nepalese fighters, was floated, but it got nowhere. In March this year, American diplomat Philip S. Kosnett published an article on the CEPA (Center for European Policy Analysis) website in which he proposes the establishment of an Afghan legion alongside the United States army. The diplomat explained that there are tens of thousands of Afghan refugees in the US, many with war experience, who need a job. In addition, there is also a shortage of troops within NATO, due to the member states' difficulties in attracting volunteers for the armed forces, and Russia's aggressions show that troops are needed to protect NATO's borders. Therefore, it is only about ideas, not officially assumed, proposed as solutions on the one hand to help the Afghan refugees, on the other hand to allow the Alliance to better face the threats of Russia.
In addition, the Kremlin is looking for justifications in front of its own citizens, but also the international community, why it calls on troops and mercenaries from Syria. The narrative tries to exonerate Russia by demonstrating similar ""sins"" in the case of the USA. Publication / Media:

CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: From the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, on February 24, until April 2, almost 4.2 million Ukrainians went abroad because of the war, according to the data of the UN Refugee Agency. Most of them - over 2.4 million - moved to Poland, and almost 400,000 entered through the Republic of Moldova, a state with approximately 3 million inhabitants. Most of them only transited the Republic of Moldova on their way to the EU, but over 90,000 are still in this country. At one time, the Republic of Moldova hosted the largest number of Ukrainian refugees compared to the country's population. Both the state, which created centers for refugees, where it offered free shelter, food and medical assistance, and citizens who hosted and continue to host refugee families got involved. The majority are women, children (half of the refugees are minors) and the elderly, because Ukraine does not allow men between 18 and 60 to leave the country.
The press published a large number of reports with Moldovan citizens who host refugees, work as volunteers at placement centers, collect products and money for them, but also with refugees who express their gratitude. However, since the beginning of the refugee crisis, a campaign about alleged abuses committed by Ukrainians has been launched on social networks, which were widely picked up and published by the Russian press. Such narratives about refugees have also appeared in other countries, including Romania, which suggests that it could be a concerted campaign.
OBJECTIVE: To present the Ukrainians as an aggressive and ungrateful people, in order to reduce the sympathy of public opinion towards them after the Russian invasion. To justify the Russian military intervention in Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The narrative is based on unproven accusations in some cases and, each time, on generalizations, referring to the statements of some people without verifying the facts.
In Ciniseuti, Rezina district, indeed the pedestal on which a Soviet tank is erected was painted in the colors of Ukraine, but there is no evidence that it was done by Ukrainian refugees, who should have stopped on the road, bought paint and to lose a piece of the day. The same thing happened with the Soviet tank in Leuseni, close to the border with Romania, and some pro-Russian politicians accused the Ukrainians of ""vandalizing"" the Soviet monument, as later, the leader of the National Unity Party (unionist) , Anatol Salaru, to announce that his team painted the pedestal.
And the accusations about Ukrainians who refuse to pay the bill, or behave aggressively when spoken to in Russian, are generalized and based on unfounded statements. Veridica dismantled such misinformation and so did the press from the Republic of Moldova.
News also appeared in the Republic of Moldova that Ukrainian refugees travel for free on public transport in Chisinau, even if no official decision was made in this regard. But the mention in the article published by mk.ru that public transport in the Republic of Moldova is expensive, is at least far from the truth. A trip by trolleybus in Chisinau costs 10 cents, and by bus - 15.
NUTS OF TRUTH: There were, most likely, abuses and cases of aggressive behavior on the part of some Ukrainian refugees, but these are exceptions, not the general rule.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Chisinau authorities urged citizens not to distribute false messages about Ukrainian refugees, and President Maia Sandu mentioned in a speech to citizens that ""it is unacceptable and irresponsible that incidents involving refugees are speculated by people in office public, dignitaries and elected for political purposes"".

[...]
for example, Moldovans do not like the refusal of their guests to pay in public transport. although in Moldova, it is quite expensive.
[...]
In addition, the newcomers have declared war on Soviet monuments, which they covertly paint in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. this is what happened in the case of the t-34 tank in the village of Ciniseuiti, painted at night by unknown vandals.
Moldovans complain that their guests ask for free food in restaurants and complain about the quality of service, although they are offered the best. recordings are published in which Ukrainians are admonished and reminded of how to behave.
‚you got free housing, food and water, baby diapers and so on. who are you? the waitress serves you, and you start shouting that she addressed herself in Russian', says a disgruntled local woman.""

NEWS: ""The UN Security Council once again showed the world its uselessness in matters that require an urgent solution to save people.

""For this initiative, they were shot by nationalist fanatics right in the yard of their house,"" said colonel-general, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, Mihail Mizintev.
NARRATIVE: The UN supports the genocide directed against Russian speakers in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The UN Security Council rejected the resolution initiated by Russia under the conditions that it did not make any reference to Moscow's role in triggering the humanitarian crisis - it appeared after the Russian army invaded Ukraine and bombed and besieged cities , killing thousands of civilians and causing significant damage to civilian infrastructure. Russia's cease-fire proposal also has a dose of cynicism, given that the Russian army is the one that should cease fire and withdraw to end the war.
In addition, 140 UN member states voted for the resolution ""Humanitarian Consequences of Aggression against Ukraine"", which accuses Moscow of military aggression. The MFA of Ukraine thanked the international community for adopting this resolution, which requested Russia to cease fire, not attacks civilians and non-military infrastructure.
According to the propaganda of the Russian Federation, the UN opposes the evacuation of civilians from Ukraine, who do not want to be killed by Ukrainian ""Nazis"". In reality, the resolution of the UN General Assembly demands exactly this - to create humanitarian corridors for civilians. The signatories of the resolution proposed to the Security Council, Russia, Belarus, China, Syria and Eritrea, voted against the resolution of the General Assembly. Therefore, even Russia opposed the creation of humanitarian corridors in the context of a resolution that calls it the author of an act of aggression.
The information in the Russian media about the attacks against civilians by the Ukrainian forces is not true either. Veridica recently dismantled a Russian propaganda narrative, according to which Mariupol was destroyed by Ukrainian (nationalist) forces in the city. The narrative is meant to divert attention from the fact that the Russian army massively bombed the city, without taking into account the fact that it kills civilians or the destruction caused. International observers and journalists have documented numerous Russian attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine, including in Kharkiv or Mariupol. According to the Ukrainian authorities, over 4,500 houses and 400 educational institutions were destroyed by Russia in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

Serghei Savostianov's approach, which is not clear to whom it is addressed, was taken up by a large number of media institutions from Russia, but also from the targeted countries. The official Russian media, such as TASS or RIA Novosti, ignored them.
NEWS: The Baltic countries, but also Poland, Moldova and Kazakhstan must be ""demilitarized"" and ""denazified"" by Russia, considers the deputy of the Moscow Duma [not to be confused with the State Duma of Russia. The Moscow Duma is the local council of the Russian capital, on behalf of the Communist Party, Serghei Savostianov, who drafted such a document
""The demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine will ensure the stable security of the peoples of Ukraine, Russia, and the whole of Europe. For a total process of ensuring the security of the IFR, in addition to Ukraine, it would be logical to include the Baltic States, Poland, Moldova and Kazakhstan in the demilitarized zone"", he mentioned.
NARRATIVE: Neighboring countries represent a danger for the Russian Federation, which must intervene militarily to ensure its security.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: On February 24, Vladimir Putin gave the order to invade Ukraine as part of a so-called ""special military operation"" aimed at ""demilitarizing"" and ""denazifying"" this state. Both are pretexts that do not - they have nothing to do with reality - Ukraine, led by a Jewish president, is not Nazi (the far-right groups did not even get the necessary votes for a single mandate in the Ukrainian parliament), and from a military point of view it is clearly inferior in terms of effectiveness and armaments for Russia, which, on top of that, is a nuclear power; moreover, it is Russia that has attacked Ukraine since 2014.
However, the Kremlin claims as its exclusive sphere of influence the territory of the former USSR and part of the former socialist camp and promotes this idea both at the political level and in cinematography and showbiz, an example being the song sung by the Russian performer Oleg Gazmanov at a recently organized patriotic concert in Moscow, where he glorifies the USSR and considers the former Soviet states, including the Republic of Moldova and the Baltic States, as his homeland. In addition, Russia has issued the claim that NATO should not have any connection with the ex-communist states, although they are the ones that requested/requested to join the Alliance precisely because they fear Russia, which historically has been a power aggressive, which attacked them and occupied their territories over time.
OBJECTIVE: To maintain in the collective mind the idea of ​​a strong Russian state, capable of ""shaping"" its neighbors according to its own needs. To present the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine as a successful one, which will continue in other states as well. To demonstrate the support of the Russian society towards the war in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: None of the states mentioned by the elected local Muscovite represent a danger to Russia and do not intend to attack this country. The Baltic countries and Poland are members of NATO, a defensive alliance.
The Republic of Moldova is a small, neutral country with a miserable military budget, and Kazakhstan demonstrated that it is still obedient to Moscow, when it requested the intervention of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), controlled by Russia.
Regarding the ""denazification"" narrative, it should be noted that the extreme right does not represent a notable political force in any of the mentioned states and in none of them was there a ""Nazi"" government after the Second World War. It should be noted that the European extreme right was cultivated even by the Kremlin, which maintained ties with the German AfD, the National Assembly led by Marine Le Pen, or Matteo Salvini's Northern League.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: Kiev qualified this statement as proof that the Russian Federation does not intend to stop in Ukraine. ""Everything is just beginning. The Russians sincerely promise that a lot of blood will flow in Europe"", commented the adviser of the Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelensky, Mihail Podoleak, quoted by Korrespondent.net.

The false narrative was spread in Romania by Sorin Rosca Stanescu in Cozmin Gusa's show. Both previously promoted disinformation and fake news and had positions similar to those of Russia.
NEWS: ""Journalist Sorin Rosca Stanescu declared in the program Ce i in Gusa, and in Capusa that: ""The idea that the Black Sea can be blown up is not old at all. There are deposits of toxic and dangerous substances there, and now, with these mines planted, the risk has increased exponentially.""
Several riparian states have warned about the danger that the mines placed in the northwestern area of ​​the Black Sea can represent. The mines come from the coast of Odessa, the main port of Ukraine on the Black Sea, and some experts believe that they are part of the defensive device placed by the Ukrainian army to prevent the landing of Russian troops in this city.
On Tuesday, March 22, some of these mines are allowed to circulate freely on the Black Sea. Leaving the net in which they were fixed, they circulate freely in the Black Sea near the coasts of Ukraine, Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania.
Sorin Rosca Stanescu recalls an article published in the Soviet military press during the Cold War in which a general would have written that the Russians were then prepared, in case of an atomic war, to resort to a very dangerous weapon. ""This is about the ultimate weapon, namely the explosion of the Black Sea"" - says the journalist.
[...]
The journalist poses the problem of commercial ships traveling at sea that can be put in danger, if the mines are not fished out and withdrawn in time. Also, traffic through the ports would be difficult."" NARRATIVE: Ukraine could cause a catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions in the Black Sea due to the launch of some naval mines.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: One month after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian army has not achieved any notable military success. Most of the big cities are under the control of the Ukrainian forces, and Russia seems to have changed its initial tactic, which seemed to rely on blitzkrieg, in favor of a siege and bombardment of the cities, including civilian areas. The goal is to sow fear among the Ukrainian population so that they put pressure on the political and military power to accept the peace conditions that Russia wants to impose.
As far as the southern region of Odessa is concerned, the Russian military has not made progress in the field for a long time. A real fortress was formed around the city, both land and naval. The Russians cannot penetrate these two ways, and the landing attempts were quickly foiled by the Ukrainian forces. Defense measures for Odessa and the Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea include the placement of mines.
The narrative regarding the danger of an explosion of the Black Sea was launched on Cozmin Gusa's show by the former journalist, Sorin Rosca Stanescu. Both characters had, over time, public positions similar to those of Russian propaganda. Cozmin Gusa was involved, since the beginning of the war, in spreading some anti-Ukrainian narratives in Romania. Sorin Rosca Stanescu, for his part, was one of the promoters of this type of narrative, even saying that Romania would risk a war with Russia because of Ukraine. Rosca Stanescu does not have any special training in the military or environmental field to have the competence to approach such topics that must be explained scientifically and militarily.
Sorin Rosca Stanescu launched in Romania the narrative regarding a danger in the Black Sea shortly after the Russian news agency TASS launched a news regarding an alleged danger generated by Ukrainian mines.
Rosca Stanescu did not mention anything in her speech on Gold FM about who launched this hypothesis, precisely so as not to discredit it as a Russian disinformation operation.
 
OBJECTIVE: Scare the population and generate a feeling of hostility towards Ukraine. Obtaining a public pressure that would cause the authorities to, in turn, press for the removal of the mines, which would benefit Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: ""Russian claims about Ukrainian mines floating in the Black Sea could be more a matter of complicating navigation and instilling fear than a real threat,"" said the head of the Bulgarian Naval Forces, Admiral Kiril Mihailov.
Three days ago, Romania also sent the minesweeper ""Vice Admiral Constantin Balescu"" to the Black Sea with the mission to conduct research in Romanian territorial waters, but the ship did not report that it had found any such mines.
Veridica also spoke with military experts from Chisinau who explained that the probability of such mines breaking loose from the place of fixation is very small.
""First of all, taking into account the fact that the information was released by the Russians (from Novorossiysk, not far from Odessa), it could be fake news, in the style of the Russians. In addition, Romania and Bulgaria did not report on the attestation of some drifted mines. I don't know Turkey's position.
According to specialists, it is very difficult to detach them from the place of planting, even in stormy conditions. It remains for me to assume that it is only a subversive plan of the Russians: to throw mines adrift in order to make commercial navigation on the Black Sea difficult"", declared, under the protection of anonymity, a high-ranking officer from the army of the Republic of Moldova.
The theory regarding the explosion of the Black Sea was launched during the Soviet period, as Sorin Rosca Stanescu also said, but it has been dismantled for more than three decades. In fact, naval warfare has been fought in the Black Sea over time, mines have also been used, countless explosions have occurred and no cataclysmic event has taken place - or at least one that suggests that it could happen something. There is indeed hydrogen sulfide in the Black Sea, but for it to cause a cataclysm, a massive event would be needed - an impact with an asteroid of at least 250 meters in diameter or a nuclear explosion.

NARRATIVE: The city of Mariupol was destroyed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The journalists from RIA NOVOSTI quote the ""witness"" Roman Filimonov, but do not specify who he is, when he told the story, to whom he told the story. Nothing is said about which street it is about and when it would have taken place the incident. In other media, including Russian or local ones, nothing is mentioned about the alleged attacks of the Ukrainian army on the city which, in fact, it is defending.
The false narrative built on the basis of a single untruthful ""testimony"" is completed with a statement by a Russian official, who accuses the Ukrainian military of being ""nationalist gangs"" and of burning and destroying the city of Mariupol. The statement is meaningless, given that for the defenders of a city it is important to preserve as many infrastructure objectives as possible to rely on during defensive efforts - and the goal of any army is to protect its population and defend its territory from destructions. These are caused by those invading forces who are not able to advance without the support of heavy weapons, which they use in an attempt to destroy the resistance.
If we monitor the information on the Facebook group of the residents of the city of Mariupol, we notice that no one writes anything about the aggression of the Ukrainian nationalists or about the tanks of the armed forces opening fire on the houses.
International observers and journalists have documented numerous Russian attacks on civilian targets in Donbass, including Mariupol. The world community was shocked by the Russian bombing of the Theater in Mariupol, where around 1,000 people were sheltering. The building was marked as a children's shelter.
Since the beginning of the war, Russian propaganda has been trying to justify the invasion of Ukraine and the bombing of civilian targets, including schools and hospitals. According to a propaganda narrative debunked by Veridica.ro, a Ukrainian attack on Donbass was imminent, and Kiev is disguising its intentions by deploying soldiers in schools and hospitals. In fact, through such propaganda narratives, Russia admits that it attacked schools, theaters and kindergartens, under the pretext of the need to kill Ukrainian soldiers. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: Ukraine will attack the US embassy in Lviv and blame Russia in order to draw NATO into the war.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Ukraine has never attacked civilian targets or buildings of diplomatic representatives on its territory or on Russian territory. Kiev tried and is still trying to obtain the imposition of an air exclusion zone by NATO, a request rejected by the Allies because it would involve the involvement of the North Atlantic Alliance in a direct war with Russia. Beyond the refusal of involvement at this level, NATO states support Ukraine politically and economically, have adopted severe sanctions against Russia and even provided significant amounts of weaponry, including portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems that have been used extremely effective against Russian forces. Losing this support following a fake attack would be extremely costly for Ukraine. An offensive or a bombardment by Russia cannot be ""directed"" under the conditions in which the allied forces intensively monitor the border area, so that they would immediately identify troop movements and the place of origin of some attacks.
On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that Russia is already planning a series of air attacks on the cities of western Ukraine, preparing through such propaganda narratives the internal public opinion for a possible expansion of the conflict and an invasion of the neighboring regions with NATO and EU member states.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives about the involvement of nationalist forces in the destabilization of the situation in Ukraine, including that they escaped from the control of the authorities. Nationalist battalions and other paramilitary groups were disbanded by Kiev starting in 2016, and the last independent fighting units were incorporated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2019.
The Azov Battalion, which originates from a far-right militia, is used by Russia to justify its excesses: in Mariupol, for example, where this unit's main area of ​​operations is, Moscow lied that Azov fighters had located in a maternity hospital and a theater, both bombed by his forces.

The Russian side does not attack civilians in Ukraine, while the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not allow refugees to leave the cities, using them as human shields.""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine wants to prolong the war and uses its citizens as human shields, while Russia protects Ukrainian civilians.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, under the pretext of denazification and demilitarization, Russia invaded Ukraine, attacked and bombed the country's cities, killing civilians and causing significant damage. Residential buildings, kindergartens, schools, medical centers were destroyed, and among the victims of the attacks were children, women, and elderly people, a fact documented by journalists, diplomats and observers from all over the world. Social networks present people's accounts of Russia's war crimes. The statement about Moscow's concern for civilians is just propaganda that cannot be proven by the reality on the ground. Since it is increasingly difficult for the Russian media to hide the truth about the destruction and victims in Ukraine, the narrative about civilians being used as human shields by the Ukrainian military is increasingly being used.
Veridica recently dismantled a Russian propaganda narrative, according to which Ukraine was preparing to attack the Donbass and masked its intentions by hiding soldiers in schools and hospitals; basically, Russia has admitted that it has bombed such targets. Countless images from the scene, testimonies of surviving victims, findings of international organizations, show unequivocally that the schools and other civilian targets did not belong to the Ukrainian army and were clearly marked as civilian targets, so nothing could have led to the conclusion that they are used by the army; it is obvious that Russia targeted them intentionally.
It is also not true that the Presidency in Kiev would have lost control over some nationalist battalions. In reality, there are no battalions not controlled by Ukraine at the moment. There are hundreds of territorial defense units, well organized, which manage to oppose the resistance of the Russian army. Nationalist battalions and other paramilitary groups were disbanded by Kiev starting in 2016, and the last independent fighting units were incorporated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2019.
Regarding the alleged intention of Kiev to continue the war, the peace proposed by the leaders of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk would, in fact, mean a capitulation of the Ukrainian leadership to invaders. Russia also wants to force, by means of weapons, Ukraine to become a vassal state, to conduct its politics as Moscow wants, to cede to it a series of territories it has occupied (Crimea, Donbass), to give up any security guarantees and armed forces, which would keep it constantly vulnerable. Basically, it is a capitulation again. The leadership of Ukraine is accused of wanting war precisely because it resists the invasion of a foreign force and refuses to surrender unconditionally.
This propaganda narrative aims to accustom the public opinion in Russia that the application of military force against neighbors is something normal, which reminds us of the concept of just and unjust war from the USSR period: ""A just war is the one waged by the Soviet state , and an unjust one is the one carried against him"".

Through such messages, launched after the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow suggests that the Russians would be discriminated against to intimidate countries like the Republic of Moldova, but also to discourage their citizens who want to leave the country.
NEWS: During the month of March, on the social media pages of Russian diplomatic missions in several countries, Russian citizens were invited to inform the embassies if they are discriminated against. ""We ask Russian citizens and compatriots who are subject to discrimination on grounds of nationality, language, culture, religion, if they have been victims of violence or have been threatened, to contact the Embassy's special email address,"" the message reads. in Russian published on the Facebook page of the Russian embassy in Bucharest on March 11.
Five days later, similar messages were published on the pages of the Russian embassies in Chisinau and Helsinki. NARRATIVE: Russians abroad are discriminated against and tolerance in Western democracies is just a myth.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: The most vulnerable in this situation is the Republic of Moldova, a small and poor state, with society divided including on ethnic, linguistic and foreign policy criteria, which also faces a secessionist conflict in the east, the region being controlled, de facto by Moscow, which also has a military contingent there that, officially, guards a warehouse with weapons and ammunition from the Soviet era.
The Republic of Moldova is seen as a potential next target of Russia after Ukraine, and the Russian embassy's message aims to justify the extension of the ""denazification"" operation, commented jurist Alexandru Tanase, former president of the Constitutional Court. And other experts commented on the message of Russian diplomacy as a challenge.
The Finnish expert Jussi Lassila told the local media that in the conditions in which Russia lost the information war in favor of Ukraine and has fewer and fewer partners abroad, it is trying to justify the war among its citizens who have left the country, even if it is assumed that many of they don't support him.
OBJECTIVE: A large number of complaints (documented or not), could be invoked by Moscow to justify possible actions aimed at defending its fellow citizens. Intimidation of the states where these appeals were launched, so that they do not align with the Western position of sanctioning Russia and denunciation. In the case of the Republic of Moldova and/or Finland, the complaints could serve as reasons for pressure on the Russian minorities to be granted additional rights/privileges. The approach conveys, at the same time, to Russian citizens that Moscow remains strong and is able to defend them, but also that, if they leave their country, once they get out, they risk being marginalized.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The undermining of the rights of the Russian and Russophone minority in the Republic of Moldova is one of the permanent messages of Moscow, the Russian media, and some local politicians. In the Republic of Moldova, Russians represent approximately 4% of the population (calculations do not refer to the Transnistrian region), and 20% represent Russian-speaking national minorities. Russian has the status of an interethnic communication language, it is studied in schools. Approximately 20% of schools in the Republic of Moldova are taught in Russian or mixed.
Romania and Finland, in turn, are recognized countries for respecting the rights of minorities.
NUTS OF TRUTH: Because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, public opinion in several countries has become more critical of the Russians. But that attitude is primarily aimed at the Russian rulers, it is motivated by the war and has no ethnic, linguistic or religious basis
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: In the Republic of Moldova, there were no cases of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, and the message of the Russian Embassy does not contribute to maintaining calm in society, commented the Embassy's message, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration from Chisinau, Daniel Voda,, This post does not contribute to the atmosphere of calm in our society and we ask the partners to refrain from such gestures and to show evidence of a better assessment of the situation in our country.
We want to emphasize that in our country the rights of all residents are guaranteed, the Republic of Moldova being a model in the region for peaceful and safe coexistence among all its residents, regardless of their assumed ethnic origin.
In this context, we bring to your attention that there were no cases of discrimination recorded in any form, especially on ethnic criteria, the Republic of Moldova being guided by solid, European mechanisms to prevent discrimination"", wrote Daniel Voda.

NARRATIVE: Russia discovered a concentration camp in eastern Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The ""Aidar"" battalion, originally made up of volunteers and acting as a paramilitary group, fought against pro-Russian forces in the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014-2015. The presence of this battalion in Donbass was noted and monitored by observers from the OSCE, the UN and other international organizations; some of which drew attention to the fact that various paramilitary groups were not part of the regular Armed Forces of Kyiv. Since 2016, Ukraine has taken measures and included all paramilitary units in the national defense system.
While Aidar's presence in Donbass was confirmed, no international organization that had observers in the region found the existence of concentration camps in eastern Ukraine, as evidenced by the reports published quarterly by the OSCE.
In addition, the Russian press contradicts itself: on the one hand, it writes that no one managed to survive the unbearable tortures, but some online newspapers, including Izvestia, published a series of interviews with the survivors of this concentration camp, organized, faces, according to the Nazi model.
In other words, on the one hand, the camps were secret, no one knew about them and no one survived them, and on the other hand, there are many witnesses and survivors from 2014, some of them refugees in Russia, but Moscow he only now found out about them and their testimonies.
It should also be noted that no television station or news portal published images of concentration camp survivors. Only their names and testimonies are cited, which raises a series of questions regarding the veracity of the information.
Finally, the location of concentration camps near the demarcation line is not logical. Usually, secret prisons are not established near the front, but in places that are more difficult to access.
In reality, Russian TV stations found former training centers of volunteer groups in Donbass from 2014-2015 and constructed propaganda narratives to find new justifications in front of domestic public opinion for the invasion of Ukraine. Publication / Media:

According to a recent narrative, a Ukrainian attack on Donbass was imminent, and Kiev is masking its intentions by deploying soldiers in schools and hospitals.
NEWS: The first deputy of the Minister of Information of the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) Daniil Bezsonov told RT that he came into possession of a report of the battalion chiefs no. 105 and 109 of the Territorial Defense. These were kept in electronic format at the military commissariats in Volnovaha.
According to Bezsonov, the report shows that the Territorial Defense Units were deployed in municipal objectives, including schools. He specified that the medical institutions were used to treat the wounded, the sick and the children were forced to leave the hospitals. [...] ""These are second line units to support the offensive against us. These data confirm that the Ukrainian side was preparing an offensive against Donbass in advance,"" he said. The Russian Foreign Ministry once called the bombing of Donetsk with Tocika-U missiles by the Ukrainian military a crime against humanity.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine was preparing an offensive in Donbass, and Ukrainian troops were deployed in schools, hospitals and other civilian targets.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russian publications have attached a series of documents on Telegram channels, which would have proven that Moscow saved the Donbass from genocide through its military operation to de-Nazify Ukraine. If we analyze the documents in Ukrainian presented as evidence, we notice that it is a simple conversation between Ukrainian soldiers, an exchange of information between the Ukrainian army and the battalion from Volnovaha. There is no information about an alleged plan to attack Donetsk or Luhansk. In the reports presented as secret, it is mentioned that the Territorial Defense Unit consists of 72 people! Therefore, Kiev proposes to storm Donetsk with a hand of volunteers, who are not even professional soldiers. In addition, the Russian press and the representatives of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk do not remember that the battalion from Volnovaha was there in compliance with the Minsk Peace Agreement, because the distance of 30 km from the demarcation line was respected.
Ukraine tried until the last moment to avoid a war with Russia, given the massive disproportion of forces, so it is absurd that, with 150,000 Russian soldiers mobilized at the country's borders, Kiev would have taken the irrational decision to attack.
Veridica.ro recently dismantled a series of fake news about an alleged massacre in Donbass, prepared by Ukraine through its territorial defense units. In reality, the Territorial Defense of Ukraine is a new element in the security system, which has no offensive purpose. According to the concept of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the purpose of these Territorial Defense Units is to buy time in case of an attack on any region or city until professional soldiers can be sent to the scene.
Regarding Russia's repeated claims that Ukrainian forces occupied various civilian targets, which would have justified their bombing, countless images from the scene, testimonies of the victims who survived, findings of international organizations, accredited journalists, etc. shows unequivocally that the respective locations did not belong to the army.

NARRATIVE: In the secret biological laboratories of the USA in Ukraine, the coronavirus was produced.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: After the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that there were secret US-funded laboratories in Ukraine where biological weapons were being developed, Russian officials tried to dress up this narrative with new elements and made this reference to SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that is believed to have originated from bats.
Veridica.ro recently dismantled the basic narrative, which constitutes one of the cores of the war propaganda, according to which Russia is bombing Ukrainian cities to destroy biological weapons laboratories and save humanity. In reality, there were no laboratories in Ukraine where biological weapons were produced or developed. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons. Moscow did not present any concrete proof of the existence of such laboratories, but justified the attack on Ukrainian cities and Snake Island by the need to destroy them.
The history of this false narrative is older and since 2020 the US embassy in Kiev has reacted to it by stating that there is no American secret laboratory on the territory of Ukraine.
The propaganda message is an attempt to arouse a wave of hatred of Russians towards Ukraine and the West, which, apparently, brought to the country COVID-19, being a casus belli found post-factum by the Kremlin. Regarding the coronavirus, Moscow is reviving the conspiracy theories according to which the virus was created by the Americans to destroy humanity and only Russia again has to save it.
Veridica showed in the analyzes published last year how Moscow promoted a series of false narratives, fake news and disinformation regarding the pandemic, including a conspiracy theory according to which COVID-19 is a weapon created by the Pentagon in laboratories in former Soviet states.

""I think we can discuss various aspects that refer to the temporarily occupied territories and the unrecognized republics...

NARRATIVE: The President of Ukraine could recognize Donbass and Crimea as Russian territories.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the president of Ukraine has not declared that he is willing to discuss the status of the self-proclaimed republics in Donbass or Crimea's belonging to Russia. His words were taken out of context and interpreted in a way favorable to Moscow. Being asked by the ABC News journalist if Ukraine could accept Putin's conditions and recognize the occupation of Crimea and Donass, Zelenskiy asked Vladimir Putin to sit down at the negotiation table. At the same time, the president declared that Ukraine is looking for dialogue and compromise, but has no intention of capitulating. The Russian press presented this statement as a compromise already made, as a concession.
After the appearance of this propaganda message, the pro-presidential party in Ukraine ""Servant of the People"" explained to the international press that during the negotiations with Russia the subject of the territorial integrity of Ukraine will not be discussed. ""We have to decide how people's lives will be organized."" in these territories within the limits of our integral state, this was the message of President Zelenski"", according to a press release of the ruling party, which mentioned that Ukraine will include Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea after the war.
The purpose of this propaganda narrative was to show the Russian domestic public that the ""denazification operation of Ukraine"" (in reality - a military invasion) is succeeding and that Zelensky is willing to accept Moscow's demands. In fact, after 2 weeks of fighting , Russia did not achieve its tactical goals, Ukraine continuing to resist. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: Kiev was preparing an aggression against the Donbass in March, that's why Russia had to intervene in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The documents published on the RIA Novosti Telegram channel, as well as on pro-Kremlin media web pages, do not describe the preparation of an offensive on the Donbass controlled by pro-Russian separatists, but present the process of military reorganization in the area of ​​the Operation United Forces. The order of presentation of the photographed pages from the so-called secret documents seems to be dubious: the description of the operation of the united forces, which has been taking place in Donbass since 2014, is presented in the context of other documents that are out of context and whose authenticity can be questioned. The final decision, cited by RIA Novosti, is not even signed by the Ukrainian general Mykola Balan, it is not clear whether the document is a draft decision or a fake document. On the last page of the document we find grammatical mistakes, linguistic inconsistencies or alignments that have nothing to do with the logic of an act that would indicate preparation for an offensive operation.
Several times Ukrainian officials denied the information in the Russian media about Ukraine's preparations for an offensive against the Donbass. The Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, stated that Ukraine never intended to attack, to launch a war against the Donbass or Crimea because it cares a lot about the lives of civilians, unlike Russia which attacked civilian targets : kindergartens, schools, etc.
Russia has long launched narratives regarding alleged aggressive intentions of Kiev; see for example the one according to which Ukraine is preparing to massacre the civilians in Donbass, dismantled by Veridica. And the foreign minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, justified the invasion as a preventive measure for the outbreak of a possible war right on the territory of Ukraine, a statement that is part of Russia's metanarratives regarding the situation in Ukraine.
In addition, Ukrainian military analysts have always been aware of the disproportion of forces between Ukraine and Russia, which in the world also has nuclear weapons. Kiev knew that an attack against the Donbass would have immediately generated a military response from Russia, something confirmed by the fact that the safety of the separatist republics was invoked by Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine.

NARRATIVE: Russia is bombing Ukrainian cities to destroy biological weapons laboratories and save humanity.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: There were no biological weapons production laboratories in Ukraine, financed by Western states. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons. Despite this fact, in recent years the Russian press has drawn the attention of public opinion in the post-Soviet states to some American-Ukrainian projects in the field of biological research. The agreement between Ukraine and the USA in this field is presented by the Russian media as an element of the production of biological weapons. In reality, such collaboration agreements also exist in the case of other post-Soviet states, and until 2012 the USA also cooperated with Russia in this field. Moscow does not present any concrete evidence that there was any laboratory for the production of biological weapons in Ukraine, but it justifies the attack on Ukrainian cities and the Snake Island by the need to destroy them.
In fact, in the first days of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Moscow attacked airports, military centers and critical infrastructure, not ""basement laboratories"". International press reporters present in Ukraine reported daily on bombings and attacks against civilian infrastructure. They were destroyed schools, kindergartens, killed women and children.
The purpose of this propaganda narrative is to present Russia as a savior of humanity and to justify aggressive actions in Ukraine as a necessary measure to destroy the biological weapons production laboratories, which are an invention of Russian propaganda. Publication / Media:

In this key, the Russian press describes the attacks against Kharkiv, the capture of the civil nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia and the occupation of the decommissioned power plant in Chernobyl, where in 1986 the biggest nuclear accident in history took place.
NEWS: ""In recent years, Kiev has shown an active interest in the exploitation and enrichment of uranium, requesting help from foreign companies,"" a representative of the competent Russian department told RIA Novosti.

As the interlocutor of the publication noted, the active confrontations at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant are taking place because documents regarding the activity of creating nuclear weapons by Kiev were kept there"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine wants to obtain nuclear weapons, which represents an existential danger for Russia, which had to intervene militarily.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Currently, Ukraine does not have nuclear weapons and there is no evidence that it has tried to produce such weapons. The propaganda narrative about plutonium or uranium enrichment preparations, but also about classified documents from Chernobyl, Kharkiv or Zaporozhye, are just a pretext to justify an invasion of Ukraine. Moreover, public opinion in Russia was prepared in advance for such narratives. In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Russia cannot fail to react to the nuclear threat from Ukraine.
The Chernobyl plant is decommissioned and was occupied by the Russian military who invaded from Belarus in the direction of Kiev. The heavy equipment brought by the Russians raised the dust in the area, which led to an increase in the level of radiation.
The Russian army also captured, after some fighting, the Zaporozhye power station, where a fire broke out during the clashes, which led to the denunciation of Russia's actions at the international level. Later, contrary to the safety rules in the field, the Russians imposed the command of the army at the plant.
In order to give the information more credibility in the eyes of the Russians, fueled by fears about the ""American imperialists"", the ""support"" of the USA is also mentioned. In reality, Ukraine purchases nuclear fuel from Westinghouse (USA) to supplement its own reserves necessary for the stable operation of nuclear power plants.
Ukraine possessed nuclear weapons, inherited from the USSR, which it gave up in exchange for the commitment of the USA, Great Britain and Russia that its sovereignty and territorial integrity will not be violated. Russia is the one that violated this commitment since 2014, when it invaded and occupied the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and supported, with equipment and people, the insurrection in Donbass. Moscow violated this commitment again in 2022. Publication / Media:

There are assumptions about a staging of this attack: ""It is a fake prepared in advance. Look at the whole bottles in the photos and the balls arranged on the shelves.

NARRATIVE: Kiev staged Donbass separatist attacks on civilian infrastructure to justify its crimes against Russian speakers
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the context of the escalation of the situation in Donbass and the encirclement of the territory of Ukraine by the military forces of the Russian Federation, the separatist forces have intensified their firing in the direction of the territory controlled by the government in Kiev.
OSCE observers have noted a spectacular increase in cases of violations of the ceasefire agreement in eastern Ukraine, where Kiev's troops are facing pro-Russian separatists. Hundreds of explosions were recorded on both sides of the front.
Most of the time, the separatists' attacks on the civil infrastructure in the territory controlled by the Kiev government were presented in the pro-Kremlin press as some inventions of Ukraine, used as an opportunity to open fire on the territory of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Moreover, the Russian-backed separatist authorities in eastern Ukraine also declared that a car was blown up near their administration building in the center of the city of Donetsk. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, as well as Ukrainian officials, emphasized that the intensification of ongoing clashes in eastern Ukraine represents ""a provocation scenario"" designed by Russia to justify an attack on Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to convince the public opinion in Russia and the former Soviet states that the Ukrainian military are the only aggressors in Donbass, and the separatist forces are only defending themselves.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In reality, the kindergarten in the town of Stanita Luganska and other civil infrastructure targets came under the artillery fire of the separatists from Donbass, a fact documented by the international press, but also by Bellingcat or InformNapalm experts. According to independent specialists, it is an attack from the territory controlled by separatists and mercenaries supported by Moscow. In a report of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it is said that at the time of the attack there were children and educators in the kindergarten. Two of the teachers were wounded in the head. Numerous foreign television stations have documented this case and broadcast reports that dismantle the fake news released by the pro-Kremlin press.
It is worth mentioning that the Russian press quoted a lot of real or fake users of social networks, who, apparently, saw how the Ukrainian army fired at their own kindergartens and schools. The names of the witnesses, photographs or other evidence that would illustrate this narrative of Moscow are not presented.
In fact, the pro-Kremlin media and the spokespersons of the People's Militia in the self-proclaimed republics were forced to launch this fake news - ultimately quite unconvincing - because the destruction of civilian objects in eastern Ukraine by the separatist forces contradicts the messages of recent ""classic"" disinformation. Veridica.ro dismantled a series of fake news about Ukraine's intention to massacre civilians in Donbass and Russia's initiative to save Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

In fact, NATO is strengthening its eastern flank in response to Russian threats, and the forces sent by the Alliance represent a fraction of the more than 100,000 soldiers mobilized by Moscow.
NEWS: ""NATO has announced that it is sending more ships and planes to Eastern Europe while presenting itself as a defensive alliance, although no one has threatened any NATO state. NATO made an important announcement on Monday, namely that NATO Allies are putting their forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter planes to NATO deployment sites in Eastern Europe, strengthening the Allies' deterrence and defense. The reason cited by NATO would be that Russia ""continues its military consolidation in and around Ukraine"" [...] ""I welcome the fact that the allies are contributing additional forces to NATO. NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies, including by strengthening the eastern part of the Alliance. We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including by strengthening our collective defense,"" Stoltenberg said [...] Their presence makes it clear that an attack on an ally will be considered an attack on the entire Alliance. There were no forces NATO in the eastern part of the Alliance before 2014"", the press release also states. A deployment of forces that is not justified since no NATO member was threatened!"".
NARRATIVE: NATO is an offensive and aggressive alliance that is preparing for war, although no one has threatened any of its members.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The worsening of the security climate around Ukraine's borders, starting in 2014, when Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and supported the separatists who started the war in Donbass, inevitably led to an increase in the level of alert among NATO member states , especially since Russia has also intensified its activities in the Baltic and Black Sea areas. It should not be forgotten, in the context, that before the attack on Ukraine, Russia started a cyber war with Estonia and a conventional war with Georgia, a country that, like Ukraine, has Euro-Atlantic aspirations.
In particular, the countries on the Eastern flank of the Alliance increased their military capabilities against the backdrop of Moscow's increased militaristic attitude, as well as direct threats from Russian officials. At the same time, these ex-communist or ex-Soviet states, which also have the historical experience of Moscow's aggression, have repeatedly requested the strengthening of the presence of the Alliance on their territory.
In the last year, Russia has shown dissuasive aggression, by carrying out dozens of maneuvers and combat exercises around the borders of Ukraine. Currently, more than 100,000 Russian soldiers are mobilized, as well as heavy combat equipment.
In addition to the deployment on the ground, the Russian Federation presented a list of demands to the USA on December 17. Among Moscow's demands is the withdrawal of American bases from Eastern Europe. Moreover, last Friday, Russia explicitly mentioned Romania and Bulgaria, NATO member states for about 18 years, as countries from which the Alliance should withdraw its forces.
Despite the fact that it deploys impressive contingents of troops on the ground, ready to invade Ukraine, Moscow tries to victimize itself and promotes the false narrative that it would be the target of a NATO aggression.
This attempt at victimization is also reported by the US State Department, which recently published a list of Russian narratives.
""Russian government officials falsely portray Russia as a perpetual victim and its aggressive actions as a forced response to the alleged actions of the United States and our democratic allies and partners. In order to promote these statements, Russia uses one of its favorite labels to try to answer: ""Russophobia"", states the press release of the American diplomacy, quoted by G4Media.ro.
As far as Romania is concerned, one of the constant threats coming from Russia was related to the location of the anti-missile shield in Deveselu. Since then, several Russian officials have stated that Romania will become the target of Russian missiles, even though the anti-missile system in Romania uses SM-3 type missiles, without an explosive charge and which only use kinetic force. Russia claims, however, that they can be replaced at any time with attack missiles.
OBJECTIVE: Presenting NATO as an aggressive military alliance that arms itself unjustifiably. Inventing a justification for Russia's aggressive policy, presented here as a defensive one. Shifting attention from the mobilization of Russian forces near the borders of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: NATO is a defensive alliance by its statute, meant to protect the member states and respond to an attack on them. It is the sovereign right of any state to accept foreign forces on its territory and it is the right of NATO to place its forces wherever it wants, with the agreement of the states that host them. The consolidation of the eastern flank is the result of Russia's aggression in the region, being only a simple preventive reaction. A recent example was given by the head of Romanian diplomacy, Bogdan Aurescu, who declared that NATO's eastern flank must be strengthened as soon as possible after Russia nominated Romania as the country from which NATO should withdraw. Moreover, even the claims presented to the West in the context of the crisis in Ukraine represent a form of violation of the sovereignty of the member states accepted in NATO after 1997.
Moreover, Russia has previously threatened NATO states on the eastern flank. In addition, the Russian forces are clearly superior to those of the NATO states on the eastern flank, and the international troops of the Alliance sent to the respective states are not of a nature to threaten Russia, their role being one of deterrence. The alliance currently has four multinational battalions, i.e. approximately four thousand soldiers, in Poland and the Baltic states. To these are added much smaller units and some reduced contingents of the United States, and in response to the strong mobilization of Russia, President Joe Biden is considering supplementing the American forces in the region by 8,500 soldiers.
TRUTH: The USA, France, Holland and Spain have already announced their intention to send additional troops and combat equipment to Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic countries. Publication / Media:

The false narrative is a reaction to the news regarding the mobilization by Kiev of the territorial defense units in the context in which there is the threat of a Russian invasion.
NEWS: ""It seems that we were expecting a massacre: the territorial defense forces of Ukraine received weapons. Territorial defense units in the border areas of Ukraine [in the east of the country] on January 15 received weapons and information about the deployment, and by the end of winter members of these forces in all regions will be armed. [...]
The author of the WarGonzo project, Semen Pegov, considers this news to be really bad news: ""Let me explain - a large part of Ukraine's territorial brigades is composed of true ultra-nationalists. It seems that we were expecting a real massacre"", according to his Telegram channel, quoted by the news portal of the Donbass separatists Ruskaia Vesna.
The territorial defense units in Ukraine are composed of radical nationalists, and many brigades exist only on paper, according to Discover24.
These nationalists could be a tool of Ukraine in the east of the country. ""In the shortest time, the situation in Donbass could worsen"", writes the NVL portal. NARRATIVE: Extremist nationalists from the territorial defense forces of Ukraine will massacre civilians in Donbass.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Following the concentration of over 100 thousand Russian soldiers on the borders of Ukraine, the location of military equipment and techniques, Kyiv has initiated the organization of a new territorial defense structure, which will be additional to the traditional army. The Russian press reacted to the news about the arming of the members of the territorial defense forces with various false narratives about the warlike intentions of Ukraine, thus continuing the older narratives according to which Kiev would have organized, with the support of the West, a genocide that targeted the Russian-speaking population of Donbass .
During 2021, but also at the beginning of the current year, the pro-Kremlin press wrote about Ukraine's desire to attack the Donbass or Russia, increasingly accusing what it called the Russophobia of Kiev and the West.
Veridica has already analyzed a series of false narratives on this topic. The press organs of the Russian government and those of the self-proclaimed republics DNR and LNR present the situation in Donbass not as a conflict artificially supported by Moscow to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, but as a genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.
To sow fear of Kiev in eastern Ukraine, the pro-Kremlin media distributed news about Ukrainian Nazism, which is dangerous for Russia. The narratives in question were recently dismantled by Veridica.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to present the process of establishing territorial defense in Ukraine not as a defensive operation and a reaction to Russian threats, but as an initiative by Kiev to attack Russian speakers in Donbass.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, territorial defense in Ukraine is a new element in the security system, which has no offensive purpose. The territorial defense forces represent a reserve component of the Ukrainian army. In this regard, 25 territorial defense units were created, which include over 100 thousand non-professional soldiers. According to the concept of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the purpose of these territorial defense units is to buy time in the event of an attack on any region or city until professional soldiers can be sent to the scene.
According to the representatives of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, territorial defense is subordinated to the Ministry of Defense, therefore the confessional or ideological beliefs of its members (nationalists, socialists, etc.) do not matter. Taking into account the purpose of the territorial defense forces to hold the enemy in place until the arrival of professional soldiers, the arming of these troops does not in any way represent any danger for the Russian speakers of Donbass.
Journalist Semen Pegov, who wrote about the ""massacre"" planned by Ukraine and is quoted by the pro-Kremlin press, manages a Telegram channel with over 140 thousand subscribers. He is close to the leadership of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and known through the fake news he has distributed in recent years. For example, in April 2021 he wrote for the Russian press that Ukraine hired mercenaries from Syria to organize a genocide against the inhabitants of Donbass. Ukrainian press reported in August 2020 as one of the leaders of the self-proclaimed Republic of Donetsk, Denis Pusilin, called Semen Pegov ""friend, colleague and brother"". Pegov was decorated with the Russian ""Merit to the Fatherland"" order for the correct coverage of the events in Crimea in 2014. He was also active on the territory of Belarus during the protests in 2020, writing about the protesters ""paid"" by the West. Publication / Media:

The narrative starts from an approach aimed precisely at protecting consumers.
NEWS: ""The double standard of product quality was legislated by the European Commission. Thus, officially, in Romania it will be possible to sell goods under the same brand, manufactured especially for third-category countries, that is, a kind of by-products sold at the same price to third-class European citizens. As a consolation, the Ministry of Economy introduced the obligation for companies to specify the difference between products on labels. The pressure exerted on the EU, during Dragnea's time, to put an end to the entry on the Romanian market of some products under the same brand, but with an inferior quality, did not have the expected effect. However, the European Commission appealed and agreed to amend Directive 2005/29/EC, admitting that any activity of marketing a good, in a member state, as being identical to a good sold in other member states, is a deceptive commercial practice. although the respective good has a significantly different composition or characteristics. However, the new article introduced in the directive has an exception, that of the case where this is justified by legitimate and objective factors. The provision was taken over in a draft ordinance by the Government, and, as a consolation, the Ministry of Economy introduced an article that requires companies that practice a double standard of quality to specify this on the product label"", it is shown in an article from the National.ro portal
NARRATIVE: 1. Romania is a second-hand country in the EU and a ""consumption colony"" of the West.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Russian propaganda continues to insist on the theme of Romania as a second-rate state in the European Union, treated with double standards by Brussels and as a European consumption periphery of low-quality products of international corporations.
Transcription of European Directives into national legislation is seen as a form of political and economic subordination of the newer EU member states to the older states within the Union.
They march on the idea that Romania is treated discretionarily, as a colony of the West's political-commercial interests and a consumer market, and that thus the country's sovereignty is undermined. At the same time, narratives of this type want to induce the idea that Romanians are second-class European citizens.
OBJECTIVE: To create a heightened sense of Euro-skepticism and a hostile attitude towards the European Union and more broadly towards the West.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: First of all, Directive 2005/29 of the European Commission has not undergone any recent changes. Its last revision, according to the official website of the European Commission, dates from May 20, 2020.
Directive 2005/29/EC distinguishes two categories of commercial practices that are unfair if they cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that the consumer would not otherwise have taken: deceptive commercial practices (by action or omission) and aggressive commercial practices.
What the Romanian Ministry of Economy is currently doing, through the ordinance complained about by the author of the article, is to put the European legislation on the subject for a better assurance of compliance with the legal norms on consumer protection and the modernization of these on January 7, 2022 norms.
In article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2, the obligation is introduced for merchants to specify if, in the case of an activity of marketing a good on the territory of Romania, as being identical to a good sold in other member states, even though the respective good has a composition or significantly different characteristics, justified by legitimate and objective factors, traders provide consumers with adequate information regarding the differentiation of goods as a result of legitimate and objective factors, so that this differentiation is easily identified by consumers. Traders provide consumers with information in a way that allows them easy access to it"".
But this will allow the consumer to be informed if such a product sold under the same brand has different characteristics in Romania, compared to other countries, a fact that has not happened until now.
In other words, the seller is now obliged to signal very visibly and easily for the potential buyer if there are such differences and what exactly they are.
""This ordinance transposes into national legislation Directive (EU) 2019/2161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 27, 2019 amending Council Directive 93/13/EEC and Directives 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding a better assurance of compliance with the Union's consumer protection rules and the modernization of these rules, published in the Official Journal of the European Union, series L, no. 328 of December 18, 2019"", it is shown in the draft ordinance of the Ministry of Economy.
Therefore, Romania adjusts its internal legislation on the basis of the European Directives on consumer protection.
Amendment Directive (EU) 2019/2161 introduces a specific rule that addresses the deceptive marketing of some goods as identical when, in reality, the composition of their characteristics is different (often referred to as ""differentiated quality goods"") and defines exactly what it means ""deceptive omissions"" and ""aggressive commercial practices"" (See the Unfair Commercial Practices section in the link).
It should be noted that National.ro is a publication that constantly expresses in its articles these narratives of Russian propaganda, which it tries to transform into topics of internal debate in Romania, a fact frequently noticed by Veridica.ro.

The announcement was made by Sorin Rosca Stanescu on YouTube.""
NARRATIVE: 1. The police state in Romania detained a journalist at a protest. 2. Freedom of expression is violated in Romania.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On December 21, at the Palace of the Parliament there was a protest attributed to AUR and partially assumed by this formation - its representatives stated that some of the demonstrators were not summoned by them - after which the entrance was forced in the courtyard of the building, several cars, including one belonging to the US embassy, ​​were vandalized. Following these incidents, the Romanian authorities launched an investigation to identify and hold the culprits accountable, and as part of the investigation, Iosefina Pascal, presented as a journalist for the Gold FM radio station, was summoned to give clarifications.
The announcement regarding the detention of Iosefina Pascal was made by Sorin Rosca Stanescu, who was sentenced to prison in a case in which he was accused, among other things, of ""forming an organized criminal group"". Sorin Rosca Stanescu was also involved in politics and , previously, he was a journalist, the press raising a series of question marks on the way he carried out his activity.
Iosefina Pascal is also intensively promoted by the spokesperson of the Kremlin, Sputnik, which placed her on the 2nd place in its top of the Romanian media for 2021. On the third place of this Sputnik top is the controversial politician and self-titled analyst Cosmin Gusa; his son is the official owner of the Gold FM station, for which Iosefina Pascal allegedly worked as a reporter covering the protest at the Palace of Parliament.
Iosefina Pascal has been presented as a journalist for a relatively short time. She was previously described as a fashion designer and assistant to former deputy and MEP Maria Grapini. Pascal stood out by promoting conspiracy theories and false narratives regarding the Covid pandemic and was also described as the organizer of one of the first anti-Covid demonstrations in 2020.
OBJECTIVE: To discredit the Romanian state. The victimization of Iosefina Pascal, but also her legitimization and, implicitly, the theories she supports.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: Iosefina Pascal was invited to the Police headquarters, along with other people, to provide information about the events at the Parliament, she ""accepted"" to go, and after ""it was settled"" she was present at the events at the Parliament, as a journalist, in order to produce a press material [...] she left the headquarters of the General Directorate of Police of the Municipality of Bucharest in a short time"", according to a press release from the DGPMB .

Politicians have built a world in which there are good and peaceful states from the West, against which Russia acts, which ""destroys"" and sows chaos. This approach, however, hides the actions of NATO states, which are dangerous and destabilize the situation on the globe, writes the magazine British ""Spiked""
[...]
In reality, Russia is not the main actor and cannot be considered an agent of chaos. On the contrary, everything that takes place in Ukraine and around it is a result of Moscow's older fear of Western expansion. If we observe a destructive and destabilizing force here, we must recognize that it is not the Kremlin, but NATO.
[...]
Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov mentioned that the number of western instructors has increased in Donbass. From this point of view, the Ukrainian power can be provoked to organize ""military adventures"", which will represent a direct danger to Russia's security.
NARRATIVE: Great Britain asks NATO to take responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and supported the separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, which turned into a bloody conflict that caused over 13 thousand deaths. Despite the numerous protests of the international community and the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West, Moscow not only did not stop financing the mercenaries in eastern Ukraine, but also initiated a gradual integration of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk (DNR and LNR) into the Russian Federation . The process of granting Russian citizenship was launched first, followed by a decision by President Vladimir Putin to develop commercial relations with the self-proclaimed republics.
At the beginning of November, Russia was accused, for the second time this year, of mobilizing soldiers and equipment near its border with Ukraine, raising the concern of some officials from Ukraine, the USA and the EU.
NATO and the EU have warned Moscow about the ""serious consequences"" in case of a military intervention in Ukraine, after rejecting Russia's ""veto"" on the possible accession of Kiev to the Alliance. The 27 EU heads of state and government adopted in Brussels, after a few hours of discussions behind closed doors, some possible economic sanctions aimed at discouraging Russia's military actions.
In response, the Kremlin claims that it has the right to deploy troops on its territory wherever it deems appropriate, and the Russian government press promoted false narratives, analyzed by Veridica.ro, about the Kremlin, which would have had to mobilize its forces at the border with Ukraine to defend itself from a NATO aggression.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to convince Russian-speaking readers from Russia and the former Soviet states that the crisis in Ukraine is a consequence of the destabilizing actions of NATO members, exonerating Moscow.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there is no question of any request by Great Britain to the NATO states to recognize or assume any responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine. RIA Novosti cites a little-known British magazine (""Spiked"", accused in 2020 of distributing fake news about the Near East, Turkey and NATO), it is the opinion of Tim Black, an author who has also distinguished himself with anti-Western narratives and pro-Russian on the page of the same publication. For example, Black also wrote that Great Britain is Russophobic and criticized the opposition in Russia.
A series of articles by this author are strikingly similar to Moscow's official narratives in the hybrid war that Russia is waging against the EU and NATO states. Regardless of the independent or less independent opinion of the author of the article published on ""Spiked"", this cannot be considered as the position of Great Britain, as RIA Novosti falsely claims, taken over by dozens of Russian news portals!
This manipulation technique has been used by the Russian government media in the past. In October, RIA Novosti wrote about European citizens requesting the construction of Nord Stream 3 and 4 to overcome the gas crisis, quoting a comment from the bottom of a study from Germany, published in the newspaper ""Die Zeit"". RIA Novosti then generalized the opinion of a single reader and presented it as a dominant idea in Germany and the EU - fake news analyzed by Veridica.ro.
Regarding the article in the magazine ""Spiked"", RIA Novosti applies the same manipulation technique, transforming some theses from an article, signed by a little-known author, into noisy press headlines with the aim of convincing the public opinion in Russia that the actions of Moscow regarding Ukraine are absolutely correct. The narrative in question has been promoted on several pages of the Moscow-controlled media. In other words, Britain has not criticized NATO for its policy towards Ukraine, but on the contrary, has recently declared that it will help Ukraine to modernize the naval fleet, in the context of tensions with Russia.
At the end of the article, RIA Novosti journalists quote the Russian foreign minister, who resumed another narrative about NATO and the US, which, apparently, could organize an aggression in Donbass. In reality, Russia is the one that invaded and occupied Crimea, supported the separatist movements in Donbass by violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, being declared an ""aggressor state"" by the Kyiv Parliament. These facts, however, recognized by the community international, are not mentioned by the Russian government press, but the opinions of a dubious British journalist about NATO's ""guilt"" are quoted without proving any evidence.
As Veridica has already shown, it is not in the interest of Ukraine or the West to have a hotbed of conflict in Donbass. Any conflict inhibits economic development, blocks the free exchange of goods, capital and labor, which cannot be in the interest of any state. The West did not encourage the conflict, but on the contrary, through the sanctions imposed on Russia, through the creation of negotiation formats such as the Minsk platform, which stopped the conflict in 2014-2015, it tried to regulate the conflict through a diplomatic and political dialogue. The interest of the West is the establishment of peace and the cancellation of all sanctions that block several fields of cooperation between Western economic entities and those in Russia.

The false narrative is promoted by the leader from Minsk, Aleksandr Lukasenko.
NEWS: ""The reasons for the immigrant crisis at the border were the EU's refusal to build refugee camps, but also the sanctions,"" Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukasenko told RIA Novosti.
He recalled that there was a readmission agreement between Belarus and the EU and according to it, if migrants entered the EU from the Belarusian territory, Minsk was to receive them back and place them in refugee camps [built in] Belarus.
""They had to build camps. And they started to build and then they stopped. And I stopped taking refugees from there,"" said Lukasenko.
Lukasenko also stated that the European Union was the one that terminated the readmission agreement and now he no longer wants to discuss this topic. Then, according to Lukasenko, the sanctions against Belarus began"". NARRATIVE: The EU caused the migrant crisis, after terminating the readmission agreement with Belarus and imposing sanctions on this country.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Relations between the EU and Belarus have seen many rough edges over time due to the abuses committed by Aleksandr Lukasenko, an authoritarian leader in power since 1994 and described as ""Europe's last dictator"". In August 2020, Lukasenko won a new term as president following the presidential election, but the opposition and Western capitals denounced the vote. A wave of protests followed, many of which were brutally repressed by the Minsk regime, and the EU also imposed sanctions. Aleksandr Lukasenko responded by approaching - even more so from Moscow, which remained practically the only significant partner of the country. Recently, Lukasenko has been accused by a number of EU member states of being used by Russia to generate a new migration crisis directed against the West. The leaders from Minsk and Moscow have met several times to discuss the establishment of a new union of states, created at the pleasure of the Kremlin, but also about common visions in foreign policy.
The Minsk regime would have set up/tolerated a real system through which migrants from the Middle East (Iraq, Syria, Yemen) and Afghanistan were brought to Minsk and transported from there to the border. According to some video recordings on social networks, the Belarusian security forces even assisted the migrants - and in some cases forced them - to cross into Lithuania and Poland. The Belarusian authorities are obliged not to allow crossing the border to those who cannot prove how they entered the state territory and for what purpose they are going to other countries, but both the Russian and the Belarusian press write that Minsk's actions correspond to the letter of international law. Veridica recently dismantled a false narrative, launched even by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow, Sergey Lavrov, who declared that asking President Aleksandr Lukasenko and his law enforcement structures to stop this process ""does not correspond to the principles of international law, especially the humanitarian one"". Also, Veridica analyzed in an editorial how the refugee crisis on the border between Belarus and its neighbors is based on new tactics in Russia's hybrid arsenal by cynically using an ally.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to demonstrate to the public opinion in Belarus, Russia and other states with important Russian-speaking communities that Brussels generated the migrant crisis and is responsible for it. It is also aimed at undermining the image of the EU, which, through the values ​​it promotes and its prosperity, is in antithesis to the authoritarian regimes and economic models in countries like Belarus and Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the EU has not undertaken any commitment to build camps for immigrants on the territory of Belarus, but only to finance some projects carried out by Minsk. Aleksandr Lukasenko refers to some programs with non-refundable financing intended for Belarusian beneficiaries to strengthen the infrastructure and security at the border between Belarus and the EU. In 2007, the EU allocated 7 million euros to Belarus for the construction of camps for illegal immigrants in the context of procedures for simplifying the visa regime. Also, according to Deutsche Welle, within the Joint Operational Program of the EU, around 39 million euros were allocated for the modernization of the border infrastructure. Lukasenko claims that the EU stopped building camps for refugees, but Brussels did not even deal with such activities in Belarus.
Moreover, Minsk would have received European money and would have spent it for other purposes. This was confirmed this June even by the Minister of Foreign Affairs from Minsk, Vladimir Makei, who communicated that the European money will be spent for other purposes, for the good of ""the people"". Therefore, Lukasenko's statement about the EU which, it started to build ""camps and then ""stopped"" it misinforms the public opinion. In reality, Belarus is the one that did not honor its commitments regarding the modernization of the border infrastructure.
The thesis of the leader from Minsk according to which the EU abandoned Belarus and terminated the readmission agreement is also false. Even the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, in a press release dated June 28, 2021, published by the Belta Agency from Minsk, said that Minsk initiated the termination of the agreement with the EU, the procedure completed in October.
Lukasenko's statements can also be analyzed as a reply intended for the domestic consumer of information to the statement of the Western countries in the UN Security Council, which condemned in mid-November the wave of illegal migration fueled by the authoritarian regime in Belarus. Russia denied any involvement in the migrant crisis and urged Westerners to restore a communication channel with Minsk. Also in November, the Polish Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, accused the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, of being the sponsor of the wave of illegal migrants trying to enter Poland with the support of the authoritarian regime in neighboring Belarus. Migrants from the Middle East are brought by plane to Belarus and used as human shields, to destabilize the situation in Poland and the entire European Union, said the head of the government in Warsaw.

In reality, it is Russia that, once again, has mobilized significant forces at the borders of Ukraine.

[...] I will remind you that Georgia was armed by dozens of states, but for the aggression of August 2008, it had to pay mainly the Georgian soldiers.

Moscow warned its ""partners"" about the possible consequences of such aggression.
Regardless of the evolution of the situation, all possible variants of Russia's reaction to a proxy-aggression by the US and NATO in Donbass will be quite harsh. The Ministry of Defense of Russia is strengthening its border with Ukraine with new TOS-2 Tosocika heavy flamethrower systems with an automatic control system and other safe guarantees of state sovereignty."" NARRATIVE: Russia is forced to strengthen its forces on the border with Ukraine in order to defend itself against US and NATO aggression in Donbass.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out in 2014, after President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia as a result of a social uprising, the Euromaidan, caused by his refusal to sign the Association Agreement with the EU. Since 2014, Moscow has been financing and supporting mercenaries and separatist forces established within two self-proclaimed republics in Donbass. This spring, Russia began to concentrate its armed forces near the southern, eastern and northern borders of Ukraine, which generated criticism from Ukraine and Western states. In parallel, Moscow launched various informational campaigns against Ukraine and the West.
At the beginning of November, Russia was again accused of mobilizing soldiers and equipment near its border with Ukraine, raising the concern of some officials from Ukraine, the USA and the EU. News of the troop movements comes as a range of Russian officials, from President Vladimir Putin to lower-ranking officials, have attacked Kiev's Western ties and even questioned Ukraine's sovereignty. Putin even warned that any expansion of the NATO military infrastructure on Ukrainian territory represents a ""red line"" for Moscow.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to demonstrate to public opinion that the movements of Russian troops near the border with Ukraine take place for defensive purposes. To the same extent, fears and frustrations are sown related to the policy of the West, presented as aggressive towards Moscow and Russian speakers.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After the pro-Kremlin press wrote that Russia is forced to defend the Russian-speaking population from the ""genocide"" organized by Ukraine and the West in Donbass, a narrative recently debunked by Veridica, press articles began to be published that they aim to present the concentration of military equipment and personnel at the borders with Ukraine as a necessary step for the defense of Russian territory from an aggression by NATO and the USA.
This narrative is strikingly similar to the propaganda messages from the USSR period, whose media organs have ""informed"" for decades about the American aggressor and NATO who dream of destroying the Soviet people. Several generations were held hostage by these Soviet narratives, which are reanimated more and more often by the Russian government media.
Sputnik.md, funded by the Russian government, cites Aleksandr Hrolenko, present with dozens and hundreds of pro-Russian and anti-Western comments on military and foreign policy topics on Sputnik Georgia, Sputnik Kazakhstan, Sputnik Belarus, etc., since 2014 journalist at RIA Novosti, a Russian news agency based in Moscow. In fact, these data about the expert are not mentioned in the article, he being cited as an independent observer to give credibility to the article.
In reality, neither NATO nor the USA intends to organize an aggression against the Donbass or Russia, but on the contrary, they have condemned since 2014 the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the launching of the war in eastern Ukraine. Sputnik.md does not mention that Russia was declared an aggressor state by the Parliament of Ukraine or by a number of international organizations, including the UN, but returns to the Soviet narratives about the ""imperialist and aggressive NATO alliance"".
The USA and NATO are also accused of having organized an aggression in Georgia in 2008, and Russia was forced to defend itself. The situation in 2008 in Georgia is compared to that in Donbass. In reality, in 2008 Russia violated the territorial integrity of Georgia and attacked a sovereign state. The Russian-Georgian war began in August 2008 as a result of a military operation launched by Georgia against the separatist regime in Ossetia, supported by Moscow. In response, on August 8, 2008, Russia invaded Georgia and sent troops to support the Ossetians. Georgia's actions on its sovereign territory are presented as NATO aggression, Ukraine's actions in Donbass - as genocide encouraged by the West, and Russia's invasions and its support for separatists from Ossetia and Donbass - as acts of saving civilians. A hybrid reality is built with the help of misinformation and fake news.
In fact, the narrative in question is an acknowledgment of the fact that Russia is concentrating troops on the border with Ukraine, after 3 weeks ago it claimed to maintain a military presence on its territory ""where it deems necessary"". NATO has repeatedly requested Russia lines to stop supporting the mercenaries in Donbass, stating that it wants a peaceful solution to the conflict. In April 2021, NATO declared itself concerned about the movements of Russian troops, reaffirming ""unwavering support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and Euro-Atlantic aspirations of Ukraine "" and respect for international law.

NEWS: ""The scandal related to the non-payment of the payment for Russian gas on time demonstrated that even a country under the administration of the West cannot ensure its needs without the collaboration with the Russian Federation. It refers not only to energy resources, but also to the export of Moldovan production to Russia and other member states of the Eurasian Union, despite the Association Agreement with the EU, previously promoted as a panacea to save the economy of the Republic of Moldova. In reality, the Association Agreement only harmed Moldova, because the EU market did not replace Russia.""
NARRATIVE: The association agreement with the EU brought only losses to the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova initialed the Association Agreement with the EU in November 2013, when former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych gave up on the last hundred meters, due to intense pressure from Russia. Yanukovych's change of heart led to the start of the Euromaidan protest movement, which ended with the overthrow of the president and was followed by the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the events that followed.
The association agreement was signed in 2014, and in the fall of that year the Free Trade Agreement entered into force, an important chapter that refers to the commercial relations between the Republic of Moldova and the European Community.
With the entry into force of the Agreement, Russia introduced import taxes for a number of Moldovan products, arguing that it defends its market from European products that could have arrived through the Republic of Moldova. The experts, but also some politicians, explained then that it was a political decision, intended to penalize the Republic of Moldova for its approach to the EU.
In 2019 and 2020, Russia canceled taxes for several categories of products, at the request of the former pro-Moscow president, Igor Dodon, but the respective exception no longer worked after he lost the elections.
In recent years, approximately 2/3 of Moldovan exports go to the EU market, while Russia's share in the foreign trade of the Republic of Moldova, once decisive, decreases from year to year. Russia has often used foreign trade as a political weapon, as it was, for example, in the ""wine wars"", starting in 2006, when it imposed bans on Moldovan wine production, an important product for the economy of the Republic of Moldova.
However, a part of the population and politicians such as Igor Dodon promote the rapprochement of the Republic of Moldova with Russia and the Eurasian Union, which it controls de facto.
OBJECTIVE: To accredit the idea that the Association Agreement is harmful for the Republic of Moldova, and the best development solution is to get closer to Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Association Agreement is not only about the commercial relations of the Republic of Moldova with the EU, as the author of the text suggests. This is a document of over 1,800 pages that refers to all areas of cooperation and ensuring reforms, such as the fight against corruption, the independence of justice, environmental protection, etc. due to the reforms they are carrying out for the implementation of the Agreement, the Republic of Moldova receives financial support. The EU is Chisinau's main source of external assistance. Only for the period 2021-2024, the EU approved a financial support program for the Republic of Moldova worth 600 million euros.
In addition, thanks to the Association Agreement, the EU canceled the visa requirement for Moldovan citizens, and some member states also offer them the right to work.
Foreign trade of the Republic of Moldova increased significantly with the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement. In particular, exports increased - from 1.14 billion dollars in 2013 (the last year before the application of the Agreement), to 1.83 billion in 2019, or by over 60%, an increase several times higher than the increase in exports in general.
Imports in 2019 compared to 2013 increased by only 17%, thus dismantling another myth persistently promoted by anti-Europeans that after the entry into force of the Agreement, the Republic of Moldova will be invaded with European products.

NEWS: ,, Laura Codruta Kovesi lost in court the professional rank of prosecutor with the rank of General Prosecutor and returned to the rank of Prosecutor next to the Court [...] The Prosecutors' Section of the CSM decided, in 2018, not to grant this professional degree without competition, only by virtue of the fact that he was the general prosecutor of Romania. Kovesi challenged the decision in court and has now definitively lost. The PICCJ professional degree was one of the conditions to occupy the position of chief prosecutor of the European Public Prosecutor's Office"", reported Antena3.ro
NARRATIVE: Laura Kovesi could be dismissed from the head of the European Public Prosecutor's Office.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Romania will receive from the EU through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) no less than 29.2 billion euros, money that will be invested in several sectors.
This money will represent a temptation for certain circles of interests connected to the contracts with the state, and one of the missions of the European Public Prosecutor's Office will be to ensure that, in case of irregularities, the guilty are identified and sent to court.
The former head of DNA, Laura Codruta Kovesi, is not at all a well-liked character in the political-economic circles subscribed in various forms to public money or European funds, including here even the boss of the Intact group, Dan Voiculescu, who holds the de facto position Antena3 which launched this thesis. Voiculescu was in prison for acts of corruption and is one of the exponents of the public campaign against DNA and its boss, Laura Codruta Kovesi.
The total value of the financial assistance that the EU grants through the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism has a value of 672.5 billion euros and ""is intended to boost the European economic recovery by supporting the reforms and investment projects of the member states"" .
OBJECTIVE: Undermining Laura Kovesi's image and credibility and weakening her position at the head of the European Prosecutor's Office.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: There is no correlation between Laura Kovesi's internal professional degrees in Romania and the requirements for the position of chief prosecutor of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. There is no such reference on the website of the European Council, and about her appointment in this position the institution mentions that ""Ms. Kovesi was selected from a short list of three candidates proposed by an independent selection jury and following a request open for candidacies"".
Furthermore, the former Minister of Justice, Stelian Ion, explained in a post on his Facebook page that Laura Kovesi will not be revoked from her position at the European Public Prosecutor's Office.
""I'm sorry to spoil the joy of those who yesterday applauded the brutal intervention on the protesters on August 10: Laura Codruta Kovesi will not be revoked. The process in Romania related to the acquisition of the professional degree has nothing to do with the appointment procedure for the position of European Chief Prosecutor [...] And not only will she not be revoked, but I am convinced that she will lead the EPPO very efficiently and bring it to light large frauds with European funds, including those in Romania. That's why they're afraid, that's why they howl like howling wolves. Especially since some ""smart"" guys are rubbing their palms together, since the PNRR was set in motion"", Stelian Ion wrote on his Facebook page.
He also explained that for the appointment to the position of European chief prosecutor there is no condition to have the rank of public prosecutor from the ICCJ, but to have the legal vocation to occupy the highest positions in public prosecutor's offices.
Stelian Ion specified that after Laura Kovesi's dismissal from the position of DNA chief prosecutor, she won at the ECHR the case against the Romanian State related to this revocation procedure.
""Those who are now preparing to fire cannons on European money or who already have some skeletons in their closets should change their plans or prepare their pajamas and toothbrush"", concluded Stelian Ion.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The High Court of Cassation and Justice (ICCJ) rejected the action brought by the former head of the DNA Laura Codruta Kovesi against the Superior Council of Magistracy regarding the recognition of the professional degree corresponding to the Prosecutor's Office next to the High Court of Cassation and Justice (PICCJ).

A subliminal attempt is made to refer to the era of Nicolae Ceausescu, when many foods were either missing from the shelves or were rationalized.
The narrative regarding a potential ""famine"" appears after the wave of fake news, debunked by Veridica, according to which Europe is on the verge of a catastrophic blackout.
All these narratives are fueled on a subreddit political background, in which Romania has been led for several weeks by an interim government.

WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The author refers, to support his thesis, to UN warnings regarding the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has created the conditions for an even deeper famine, especially in the third world. Such concerns are constantly expressed by the UN for the underdeveloped areas of the globe, especially since they have been and are frequently affected by famine. The UN does not talk about the states of the West and in no case about Romania. The UN specifies, in general terms, that ""an enormous effort will be needed for the world to honor its commitment to end hunger by 2030"".
Moreover, raising an example from a store in the city of Deta in Timis county to the level of a panic announcement at the national level is an exaggeration. Moreover, the source cited in the EvZ article, respectively opiniatimisoarei.ro, specifies that ""there is no official information related to a possible food shortage in Europe in the next period"", a fact that the author Antonia Hendrik, who signs several such apocalyptic articles on EvZ.ro, intentionally omits it.
To support her thesis, the author quotes the former Minister of Agriculture, Petre Daea, who, by the way, talks about a weak irrigation system in Romania and not about a food crisis that will hit the country, as the title of the article in EvZ announces.
SAME TRUTH: In isolation, some stores display such announcements regarding the amount of food that can be bought by a single person, precisely to avoid the situations of last year when various citizens overcrowded the stores in order to stock up on huge supplies of products in the event of a potential crises.

The narrative is not based on any position taken by Kiev, but starts from an anonymous comment on Twitter. The news generated by this comment seems to be part of a wider campaign that tries to undermine the relations between Chisinau and Kiev, which disturbs Moscow.
NEWS: ""Ukraine is dissatisfied with the signing of the agreement between the Republic of Moldova and Russia"", captioned the online publication censura.md, close to the Socialist Party. It mentions in an article that the Republic of Moldova has signed a five-year extension of the gas supply contract . NARRATIVE: The Republic of Moldova betrayed Ukraine by signing the extension of the gas delivery contract.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: During October, the Chisinau government held negotiations with Gazprom in order to extend the gas delivery contract, after the previous one had expired on September 30. In October, the Republic of Moldova paid a record price of almost 800 dollars for a thousand cubic meters, and the quantities delivered by the Russian giant were insufficient, so gas from alternative sources was needed.
The government from Chisinau held discussions in several countries, including Ukraine, to obtain support in the so-called ""gas crisis"". The press from Kiev wrote that the Ukrainian authorities agreed to sell to the Republic of Moldova a quantity of gas if necessary.
In general, the relations between Chisinau and Kiev improved significantly with the coming to power of Maia Sandu and the Action and Solidarity Party. The two states support each other in the context of the territorial conflicts they have (the frozen one in Transnistria, the semi-frozen one in Donbass, Crimea), which cannot but disturb Moscow.
In the press from Russia, but also in some publications from the Republic of Moldova, close to the Socialist Party and/or Moscow, several articles and comments were published which, apparently, are meant to antagonize Chisinau and Kiev. On the very day when the news about Kiev's alleged dissatisfaction with the gas delivery contract was published, several socialist-affiliated press institutions in the Republic of Moldova published a comment about the fact that the government in Chisinau cannot count on real support from Kiev. Although it was published by several media institutions, it is not clear what is the primary source of this comment and it seems to be translated from Russian through google translate.
OBJECTIVE: To damage relations between Chisinau and Kiev in order to make both states more vulnerable to Moscow and prevent them from identifying solutions for the settlement of the territorial conflicts they face
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The editor's only argument that the signing of the gas supply agreement would have disturbed Kiev is the comment of an unknown person on Twitter to the news in question who wrote ""prostitutes"".
Even if, theoretically, Kiev would have agreed that the Republic of Moldova would not sign the contract with Gazprom, which would have directly affected the separatist Transnistrian region, it is clear that Chisinau could not remain without gas on the eve of winter and without sources clear alternatives. Kiev cannot blame the Republic of Moldova, which, like most European states, including Ukraine, imports gas from Russia.
In addition, importing gas from Russia, the Republic of Moldova uses pipelines that cross Ukraine. The use of those pipelines is vital for Kiev because, on the one hand, it brings them income, and on the other hand, it keeps Moscow co-interested in the proper functioning of the pipelines, thus reducing the risks of a large-scale military intervention against Ukraine.

The false narrative is built by drawing forced parallels with moments in Romania's history when serving or reserve soldiers were appointed prime ministers.
NEWS: ""The appointment of a military man, a general at the head of the Romanian government is not a trivial fact. The most famous example is that of General / Marshal Ion Antonescu, who ended very badly and, with him, Romania too. [...] Ion Antonescu, the ""leader of the state"", was followed in the post of prime minister, after his arrest, by two other generals, Constantin Sanatescu and Nicolae Radescu, in two very short-lived governments. Previously, in 1918, three other generals, also after a war, Alexandru Averescu, Constantin Coanda and Arthur Vaitoianu, temporarily occupied the position of prime minister [...] Let's summarize: in Romania for the last 100 years we have not had a military prime minister , general than before or after the war. Not even the communists appointed a military prime minister. The deduction is required: are we before a war? We are talking here about a military conflict, and not a metaphorical war with crises, including the health or energy one and economic, for the management of which nothing recommends General Nicolae Ciuca [...] Probably Nicolae Ciuca, like Ion Antonescu, is appointed in anticipation of a possible military conflict, the one in Ukraine and the Black Sea [ ...] The idea of ​​bringing the four-star general Nicolae Ciuca to the post of Minister of Defense and, subsequently, ""civilian"" senator of the PNL does not seem to have been Klaus Iohannis's, as they keep saying. Klaus Iohannis rather played in ""imposed"" [...] Nicolae Ciuca is a product of the Pentagon, which prepared him (2004-2006) carefully. He would have attended before, simultaneously or after some English and ""NATO terminology"". But the Romanians did not really hear him speak. He is silent as significantly as Iohannis, only theoretically his boss. Because his real boss is at the Pentagon, today Lloyd J. Austin, and at NATO, in Brussels. Because that's how the military hierarchy works. For a long time, the USA and NATO have been preparing a military conflict with Russia in Ukraine and the Black Sea. After Lloyd J. Austin's visit to our region, we also know who will be the first three involved as proxies: Georgia, Ukraine and Romania [...] Romania can become the rear base of the conflict in Ukraine and the Black Sea. If there will be a conflict, it is not excluded to have a government composed entirely of generals and colonels"", comments Petru Romosan on inpolitics.ro.
NARRATIVE: Romania is preparing for war with Russia and is betting on a pro-American general at the head of the Government.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Against the background of the political crisis in Romania, after the dismissal of the liberal Citu government by the Parliament and the failure of the USR leader, Dacian Ciolos, to restore the governing coalition or obtain the votes for a minority government, the general in reserve Nicolae Ciuca was proposed prime minister of a minority government. Ciuca recently entered politics, and his appointment as prime minister by President Iohannis raised a series of questions among political experts whether or not Romania should be led by a former military man and not by a civilian.
Nicolae Ciuca has a good reputation in NATO and US military circles, where he studied several courses. His missions in Iraq and Afghanistan propelled him to the top of the Romanian Army in various leadership positions up to that of Chief of Staff and then Minister of Defense.
In addition, the army is one of the most credible institutions in Romania, which is why it received an important role including in the management of the pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: To inoculate the idea that Romania is militarizing more and more in order to prepare for a regional war with Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The past - Romania was ruled by officers after or before the war - is not a norm for the present.
The statement that Nicolae Ciuca is ""the man of the Americans"" for courses taken in two years of Ciuca's over 33 military career is a forced one. All the leaders of the Romanian army have courses in the West, either at NATO or in the USA, where they are the most prestigious military educational institutions in the world.
In fact, these statements are part of the great narratives of Russian propaganda based on the myth of ""besieged cities"" that calls for the mobilization of Russians or their sympathizers against the bellicose West. In reality, starting in 2014 from the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia and then until the biggest exercises and military maneuvers around the borders of Ukraine, it was Russia that showed a militaristic and aggressive character in the region.
By the annexation of Crimea by Russia, an imbalance of forces occurred in the Black Sea, thus forcing the states bordering this Sea, but also the entire south-eastern flank of NATO, to be more vigilant and prepared in case of a new battle scenario that could be put into practice by Moscow.
Russian narratives try to accredit the idea of ​​a regional conspiracy made up of states like Romania, Georgia or Ukraine, which would conclude and want war with Russia. Russian propaganda tries to induce the idea that such countries are led by puppets of the West who will engage the citizens of these countries in the fight just to ""show their colonial contribution to the interests of the great powers"". The leaders of these countries would be against the interests of their own citizens. and would have given up sovereignty, an arch-present theme in Russian narratives directed towards Romania, but also other states in the region.
Moreover, the author reveals part of his ""sources of inspiration"" for the article, which obviously refer to all Russian anti-Western narratives that go from geopolitics, conspiracy theory and pandemics, to religious conservatism and sovereignty. It is about the Russian , Andrei Raevsky, Russian military expert who emigrated to the USA and who signs with the pseudonym ""The Saker"" on his blog.
The portal euvsdisinfo.eu of the European Union characterized Andrei Raevsky as a nationalist analyst of the Kremlin and who propagates all Russian anti-Western and anti-Kiev narratives, as well as the xenophobic line and ultra-orthodox religious conservatism. It uses a lot of content produced by Russian media and is connected to the pro-Russian nationalist propaganda network.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: On October 20, President Klaus Iohannis appointed Nicolae Ciuca as prime minister appointed to find a majority with which to form a government.
WHO DO THE NARRATIVES SERVE: Russian propaganda that tries to induce the false idea of ​​an aggression by the West - via Romania, Ukraine and Georgia - against Russia at the Black Sea with the de facto command of the USA and NATO. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""400 American soldiers have arrived in Moldova, who will be deployed in Odessa, if the Ukrainian authorities will start the military escalation of the situation in Donbas"". The article was broadcast by VERSIA.RU, EADAILY.COM and taken over by MEJDURECIE.MD. According to the quoted source, the soldiers would be staying at the Zentrum hotel in the center of Chisinau. ""After the Pentagon failed to settle in Crimea, Odessa became for the Americans a strategic center in the confrontation with Russia. However, because the fact that in Ukraine the constitution does not allow foreign military bases to be located on its territory, the objects that are being built are presented as simple training centers, and the contingent is a small one, in order not to provoke the Russian military"", writes versia.ru, which claims that the deployment of the American military would have been agreed upon during the visit to Chisinau of Robin Dunnigan, deputy assistant to the US Secretary of State, on October 4. The deployment of the military would have started at the end of September, according to the cited source, who writes that three American aircraft were unloaded in Chisinau.
NARRATIVE: American soldiers were brought to the Republic of Moldova to participate in the war in Donbass;
CONTEXT: The narrative is part of the list of favorite topics of propaganda and disinformation coming from the Kremlin - the danger of NATO, the war in Donbass, the involvement of some states in the region in a war against Russia, etc. Disinformation about NATO appears regularly on Moscow's propaganda channels. In the Republic of Moldova, the narratives that the pro-European parties are led by the Americans and the West appeared during the election period and continued to be promoted after the victory of the party founded by Maia Sandu. Veridica deconstructed several fakes according to which the new government and Maia Sandu want to force the Republic of Moldova to join NATO at the expense of national interests and train it in armed conflicts against Russia, etc.
The situation in the region worsened after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and provoked, in 2014, a war in Donbass, eastern Ukraine. In the conflict, which has lasted for 7 years, more than 14 thousand people died. Russia is trying to transfer the blame for the victims in eastern Ukraine to Kiev, which would seek war with Russia.
OBJECTIVE: To induce the idea of ​​a Western, American aggression in the region and to create the impression that the new pro-European government in Chisinau wants to involve Moldova in a military conflict. To feed the phobias towards NATO and the Americans.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The Ministry of Defense denied the information appearing in the article taken by Mejdurecie.md, that 400 American soldiers had arrived in the Republic of Moldova to be sent to the conflict in Ukraine. Press officer Ala Diaconu told Veridica.ro that this article is a fake, a fake news.
At the end of September, the National Army received a batch of military equipment from the US Government, but this has nothing to do with the arrival of American soldiers in the Republic of Moldova. There were not 400 soldiers in the American aircraft, as can be seen in the photos from the equipment reception event, published by the US Embassy in Chisinau.
Regarding the visit to Chisinau of the deputy assistant of the US Secretary of State, Robin Dunnigan, who was in the Republic of Moldova on October 4-5, she discussed with the President Maia Sandu about the Moldovan-American bilateral relations, including the programs of development assistance, financed by the USA in the Republic of Moldova. Robin Dunnigan also had meetings with Prime Minister Gavrilita, met with the graduates of the embassy's exchange programs, discussed economic opportunities with representatives of the American Chamber of Commerce. Also, in Tiraspol, he had meetings as the representative of the USA within the regulation process in the 5+2 format, led by the OSCE. She did not have any meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Defense.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The Army of the Republic of Moldova received a batch of military equipment from the Government of the United States of America in the amount of 5 million US dollars for the purpose of realizing the Development and Transformation Plan of the National Army, according to the provisions of the National Defense Strategy and the Initiative Package of Defense Capacity Building of the Republic of Moldova (DCBI).

NEWS: RIA Novosti writes that ""the readers of the German newspaper Die Zeit do not agree with the author of an article about the gas crisis in Europe, who writes that one reason for the deficit is Moscow's energy policy."" ""Russia fulfills all its contractual obligations. It can deliver us a much larger volume of gas, by the way, unlike our friends on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean [...]. Maybe we need Nord Stream 3 and 4?"", the readers say. [...] Russian President Vladimir Putin recently stated that Moscow is willing to contribute to the stabilization of rising energy prices.""
NARRATIVE: Europeans request Russia's help to overcome the energy crisis.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Europe is facing, on the eve of winter, an increase in the prices of natural gas and energy caused by several factors, including the lack of sufficient stocks for the winter, the evolution on the stock markets, a reduced supply. Russia was accused of being at the origin of this crisis - or, at least, taking advantage of it - to promote its alternative export routes to the EU, through gas pipelines that bypass Ukraine, especially the recently completed North Stream 2. Moscow rejected the accusations and conveyed that it can cover the gas needs - but demands that, instead, long-term contracts be signed.
Gazprom's objective is to annually pump 55 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia to Germany through the controversial gas pipeline, which passes under the Baltic Sea to Germany. Several European politicians have joined this Russian project, considering it a geopolitical one, and not an energy one. The Russian-German gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 is ""a dangerous geopolitical weapon of the Kremlin"", Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in August. He pointed out that no one can deny the fact that the main risks related to Nord Stream 2 will affect Ukraine.
Rising energy prices have created divisions among member states on how the EU should respond. Not all countries are convinced that an intervention at the EU level is needed to respond to this crisis, considered by some to be temporary. On the other hand, the increase in prices has awakened a wave of discussions in the EU, becoming a fertile ground for fueling ""energy frustrations"".
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to sow fears in European societies regarding the gas crisis and to present Russia as a savior. Another goal is to demonstrate that Nord Stream 2 is absolutely necessary for the EU and coincides with the interests of Europeans.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: The Russian news agency RIA Novosti published the news about the request of the Europeans to build Nord Stream 3 and 4, and other media outlets (News.ru, Izvestia.ru), controlled by the Russian government, immediately picked up this information to maximize the media impact and create the impression that EU citizens believe that only Russia can save Europe from the energy crisis.
If we analyze the news, we notice that on the page of the newspaper ""Die Zeit"" there is only one comment on this topic, and that anonymous one. RIA Novosti generalized the opinion of a reader and presented it as a dominant idea in the EU. The whole narrative therefore, it relies on a single comment from a series of comments, which praises Russia and criticizes the author for blaming Moscow when it comes to the energy crisis in the EU.
The context in which the news is presented is a specific one. Vladimir Putin is presented as a possible savior of Europe, and among the ranks it is understood that Nord Stream 2 is not a geopolitical project, it is not a weapon, but a step in meeting European energy and economic stability. This narrative represents, from several points of view, a bridgehead in the dissemination of future fake news about Russian energy policy on the European continent. In reality, the solution proposed by Putin will generate a total energy dependence of the EU on Russia, while energy stability must be ensured by diversifying sources and switching to renewable energy.
Regarding Ukraine, Russia has been trying since 2005 to build bypass pipelines that would allow it to keep Kiev in check. Ukrainian military experts are worried that Russia's renunciation of the Ukrainian transit system could free the Kremlin's hands to start a war against Ukraine at any moment, since there would no longer be the risk that gas deliveries to the EU, a major source of income, would still be affected.

NARRATIVE: The West leaves the Republic of Moldova without a workforce.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHO: The Republic of Moldova is one of the European countries most affected by emigration. There are no official data, but it is estimated that approximately 800 thousand citizens have left the country to find a better-paid job, given that the Republic of Moldova is considered the poorest country in Europe.
Among the destinations preferred by Moldovan emigrants are the countries of Western Europe, but also Israel or the USA. In Russia, once the main destination, the number of Moldovans began to decrease due to the restrictions, but also the reduction in the standard of living in this state.
A large part of the Moldovans who settle in the EU member states use Romanian identity documents, given that the Visa Liberalization Agreement does not allow the employment of Moldovan citizens. In this context, the Republic of Moldova has signed agreements with some member states, which allow employment for fixed periods.
The signing of such an agreement was announced during the visit to Chisinau of the President of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at the end of September.
The announcement provoked criticism from some media institutions, mostly in Russian, which accused the government that instead of creating good conditions in the country for citizens, it creates conditions for them to leave the country. There are similar narratives to those of about a decade ago, when some Eurosceptic politicians ""warned"" that after the signing of the Free Trade Agreement with the EU, the Republic of Moldova will be invaded by European products, to the detriment of domestic ones. This did not come true, in instead, Moldovan exports to the EU market have increased several times.
OBJECTIVE: To fuel Euroscepticism and resume accusations against the EU, which would depopulate the Republic of Moldova. To present the current government from Chisinau, headed by Maia Sandu, as one that works in the interest of Western states and to the detriment of its own citizens.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The exodus of the labor force is a problem that the Republic of Moldova has been facing for over 20 years. Many citizens went to work abroad illegally, without documents. The same thing happens today when some Moldovan citizens are temporarily employed in EU member states. Having a prohibition to engage in the field of work, they work illegally, with lower wages and without social insurance.
The agreement that was announced with Germany will allow Moldovan citizens to legally engage in seasonal work, especially in agriculture, which many of them still do, only illegally.
The lack of labor in some fields, including agriculture, in the Republic of Moldova is largely caused by low wages, which do not encourage people to work, and the opening of new employment opportunities could lead to an increase in wages, as happened in construction, for example.

The narratives are part of a campaign to undermine Western democracies by hijacking the values ​​that are their basis - democracy, freedom, etc. At the same time, they seek to create a confusion between political concepts and fundamental freedoms and health measures.
NEWS: ""What is the difference between authoritarianism and totalitarianism?"" There is an important difference between authoritarianism and totalitarianism. This was stated by the Soviet and Russian scientist, historian, social philosopher, sociologist, publicist, candidate in historical sciences, director of the Center for Russian Studies at the Institute of Fundamental and Applied Research of the Humanities University in Moscow, Andrei Fursov, reports Noi .md ""Authoritarianism is when you are told what you must not do under any circumstances, but totalitarianism - what you absolutely must do. For example, you must treat LGBT people well, you must be happy that they exist, you must you vaccinate, you have to jump into the digital world. This is totalitarianism,"" he said. NARRATIVE: Inclusive policies towards the LGBTQ+ community, anti-Covid health policies, including vaccination, and the digitization process express a form of totalitarianism.
CONTEXT: Propaganda associated with the Kremlin, but also ultra-conservative and far-right groups from Western countries, have been attacking for years certain policies specific to liberal democracies - such as, for example, those related to the LGBTQ+ minority, migrants, etc. - including appealing to concepts that are the basis of the respective democracies. Thus, limiting the rights of the LGBTQ+ minority or rejecting migrants are not presented as efforts to limit the freedoms and rights of the target groups, but as forms of defending the freedoms and rights of ""normals"", ""the traditional family"", ""the nation"", to protect values ​​- Christian, spiritual, moral This type of argumentation and misappropriation of terminology was also taken up for narratives related to the pandemic.
Against the backdrop of the restrictions imposed by the authorities to stop the wave of infections, demonstrations took place in several European countries in which protesters denounced the curtailment of fundamental freedoms and rights and tried to present sanitary measures, taken on the basis of the recommendations of experts and scientific data , as measures of a political nature. Often such protests are animated by various leaders of extremist parties, personalities who take a position against vaccines or wearing masks, promoters of nationalist messages, etc. Such dissatisfaction with the anticovid vaccine has an even greater impact in the context in which the virus has developed new, more violent strains, the number of illnesses in countries with low immunization rates is increasing, and the authorities in some states are considering the mandatory vaccination of certain social categories and imposed restrictions on those who do not have Covid certificates. In these circumstances, the current of anti-vaccineists has gained momentum, and more and more voices are speaking about the discrimination of those who do not want to be vaccinated. These narratives circulate in parallel with the wave of fake news in a conspiratorial key regarding the nature of the virus, the vaccine and a global cabal that would use the two.
The Russian historian Andrei Fursov spoke in several interviews about the Covid pandemic, in which he claims that the ""ultra-globalists"" want to control the evolution of humanity by means of the ""coronavirus hysteria"". Some of the anti-Covid and anti-vaccination theses promoted by him were dismantled by the Voxucraine.org portal.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to associate Western democracies with totalitarian regimes, distort pro-vaccination messages or those of tolerance towards LGBTQ+ people and create confusion between health measures or human rights and political concepts.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Totalitarianism is a political regime that applies the dictatorship of a person, a group of people, or a single party. The totalitarian ideology is opposed to the concept of an open society, and the majority of the population is deprived of civil rights and freedoms. Fascism, Nazism, Communism were recognized as totalitarian regimes, which were based on violence and the repression of any form of freedom, the prohibition of multi-partyism, territorial expansion and, as the case may be, egalitarianism or racism. The party that holds the monopoly of political life is based on an ideology, which becomes official in the state. Also, in a totalitarian regime, the state has control over the law enforcement agencies, the economy, the institutions, the mass media that represent its interests.
Tolerance towards minorities, including the sexual one, and the protection of their rights seen as part of fundamental human rights (basically it is not about granting other rights, but the same rights that the majority has) is in direct contradiction with the idea of ​​totalitarianism. Vaccination or digitization, to which the author refers, are not even political concepts and are not characteristics of any type of political regime. Health policies can be used equally by totalitarian or democratic states (and in totalitarian states, if they are decided, there is no possibility of contesting them - in China, for example, no one protested, as in the West, against large-scale vaccination or the draconian lockdown imposed by the authorities in certain situations). Digitization is a process of modernization, which facilitates work and development in all fields, allowed access to information, makes various services more efficient and optimizes administrative processes, etc. Again, modern communication tools are used in the interest of the state, to transmit certain messages or to monitor the population, also by totalitarian regimes.

All this after German sources have already publicly disclosed that the European Union ""intends to demonstrate its commitment to the Eastern Partnership through military training missions of the Ukrainian Army"". So that the European External Action Service would have in progress the preparation of a training mission for Ukrainian officers. That is, exactly what the United States of America did in Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas abandoned in the meantime... And since the excess of zeal of the authorities in Bucharest is already recognized in Brussels, the Romanian soldiers withdrawn from Afghanistan will be the most probably sent to Ukraine [...]
The Kyiv government approved the Action Plan for the implementation of the ""Strategy for the de-occupation and reintegration of the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea"". The strategy assumed by the Ukrainian Prime Minister for ""neutralizing Russian threats"" is summarized as follows: ""We attract the best experts and analysts from all over the world to this problem, we also work with our partners and within international organizations, so that the topic of Crimea is permanently on the world agenda"", writes the National Newspaper.
NARRATIVE: Romania will send soldiers to Ukraine, at the behest of the West, to help recapture Crimea annexed by Russia in 2014.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Russia is attentive to the support that Kiev constantly receives from the West after, in the last year, the Russian army made several demonstrations of force in the Black Sea and on the southern and eastern borders of Ukraine.
On October 3, the German newspaper Die Welt published an article based on an internal EU document discussing the possibility of the EU supporting the training of Ukrainian officers in the context of Russia's ""ongoing military activities"" on the Ukrainian border.
""A military mission would emphasize the visibility and commitment to the countries of the Eastern Partnership initiative,"" according to a working document of the European External Action Service, the EU's diplomatic service.
Ukraine is constantly facing military pressure from Russia. In parallel, the states of Eastern Europe, including Romania, have been worried for several years about the growth of Russian militarism in the region.
It should be noted that the National Newspaper has been publishing alarmist ""fake news"" articles for a long time regarding Romania's intention to go to war with Russia over Ukraine and that Romania would be used by the West in this regard. Veridica.ro has dismantled several articles published by this site in recent months.
OBJECTIVE: Creating the illusion that Romania could venture into a regional war on the side of Ukraine against Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: First of all, it is an internal EU document, more precisely a ""policy paper"", as stated by Free Europe, which is equivalent to an analysis/evaluation of a possibility or hypothesis, not EU decision to send instructors to Ukraine.
In the framework of the Eastern Partnership of the EU with the neighboring states, security competence is anyway included as a defensive element.
Free Europe also adds that the three Baltic states of the EU are pushing especially for the military training mission, as well as Poland, Romania and Slovakia, and Sweden and Finland have expressed their support. So, it is about several European states that have expressed this view.,,Those EU members share similar concerns to Ukraine regarding Russian military exercises on their borders, including the Zapad-2021 military exercises in September and a massive build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine in April, which raised concerns in Kiev and the West about Moscow's intentions,"" the internal EU document says.
On the other hand, a military training mission does not in any case mean the preparation of a military campaign, nor participation in a war. A few military advisers will never be able to attack a military power of the rank of Russia; moreover, the Romanian army as a whole lacks this capacity, given the disproportionate ratio of forces, but also the lack of logistics necessary to launch, alone, large-scale operations far from the national territory.
NUTS OF TRUTH: There is a document of EU diplomacy that evaluates several opinions from several EU states on how Brussels should relate to the outbreak of instability in Ukraine, caused by Russia, both by annexing the Crimean peninsula and regarding the support given to the pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

In reality, the Russian press tried to manipulate opinion public through the selective use of information from the report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
NEWS: ""The UN report on the situation in Ukraine revealed some details of the nightmare that occurred after the Maidan. The head of the UN Monitoring Mission, Matilda Bogner, published the report for the period February 1 - July 31, 2021. Even the UN experts, who, for the most part, have salaries from Soros and his team, could not hide the naughty things in Ukraine - they are too obvious, it is impossible to ignore them"", informs the television station REN TV.
""The data of the report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights confirm that in most cases the Ukrainian side opens fire in Donbass. These figures coincide with the information of the LNR and DNR [self-proclaimed republics] military, who declare that they open fire only in response and not every time"", mentions EurAsia Daily, which only analyzes the figures referring to the military actions in eastern Ukraine.
""The report criticizes the sanctions imposed by the authorities on the opposition media, namely the 112 Ukraina, Zik and NewsOne television stations [...] Another report will be published in three months. What it will contain is not difficult to predict. The new report will differ from the current one in terms of numbers - less freedom of speech, more civilians and soldiers killed in Donbass by the Ukrainian army"", notes News Front, and the online publication Fondul Culturii Strategici headlines the news about the UN report as follows : ""Persecutions of Russian speakers, blocking of the press, firing on civilians - UN about Ukraine"".
NARRATIVE: The UN criticized Ukraine for persecuting Russian speakers and opening fire on civilians in Donbass.
CONTEXT / LOCAL ETHOS: Once every three months, the UN publishes reports on the observance of human rights on the territory of Ukraine in the context of the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and the launch of military operations in Donbass. Over time, several resolutions adopted by the General Assembly have denounced Moscow's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, condemning Russian aggression. EU, USA s.a. they introduced sanctions against Russia for violating international law. On the other hand, Moscow claims that it was guided by historical and international law, accepting the voluntary union of Crimea with Russia as a result of a referendum. However, this was not recognized by the international community and took place in the context in which the peninsula had already been occupied by the ""green men"".
Russia finances and supports mercenaries and separatist forces, established within two self-proclaimed republics, DNR and LNR, which incorporate a small part of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine and Western countries have repeatedly accused Russia of supporting the separatists with equipment - including heavy weapons - and troops.
The UN reports refer both to the social-political situation in the entire territory of Ukraine, as well as to the areas not controlled by the Government in Kiev. The Russian press used these reports, without presenting their general context, to demonstrate that Ukraine is a state that persecutes Russian speakers and kills civilians in Donbass.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to demonstrate that Ukraine is a Russophobic state, a fact confirmed, apparently, by UN reports. Also, through such narratives, Moscow corrects itself in front of domestic public opinion, arguing the need to intervene to protect its Russian-speaking population in Crimea and Donbass.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, most of the cases of human rights violations analyzed in the UN report refer to Crimea and the territories of Donbass, which are not under the control of Kiev, a fact passed over in silence by the Russian media. Moreover, in the same report, the UN criticizes Russia for not fulfilling the recommendations of the United Nations experts and praises Ukraine for partially or fully taking into account these recommendations: ""The Government of Ukraine fulfilled 13 percent of the recommendations of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights of man, partially fulfilled 56 and did not fulfill - 13%; The Russian Federation did not fully fulfill any recommendation, partially fulfilled 3 and did not fulfill 97%"".
According to the UN report, on the territory of the self-proclaimed republics of Lugansk and Donetsk there is illegal enlistment in the local armed forces, blocking of crossing points of the demarcation line, killing of civilians, violation of the right to private property, forced granting of Russian citizenship, denial of access to experts for monitoring the situation regarding respect for human rights, arrests, violence against women, violation of the right to protests and public assemblies, violation of the right to freedom of expression and religion, non-remuneration for work. The UN criticizes Russia for not allowing a series of civil rights in Crimea where acts of torture, persecution, searches, lack of independent justice, violation of freedom of expression and religion have been reported. As all this took place in Crimea and Donbass, legal parts of Ukraine, they were included by the UN in the report on this state.
The Russian press does not mention these and other important elements of the UN report on human rights (arrests and torture of journalists, Crimean Tatars, closure of some newspapers and associations) that are the direct responsibility of Moscow, but only the observations made to Ukraine, interpreting unilaterally and selectively the conclusions of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. However, more than 75% of the report specifically refers to the territories not controlled by Kiev. In this context, the Russian press resumed various elements of its classic narratives regarding the ""regime in Kiev"", ""Russophobia"", ""Soros's people"", ""puppets of the West in Ukraine"" etc.
NUTS OF TRUTH: The UN analyzes in a report the closure of some opposition television stations in Ukraine following the introduction of sanctions by Kiev for the cooperation of the owners and sponsors of these media bodies with the leaders of the self-proclaimed republics of Dontk and Lugansk. Also, different cases of aggression against members of the LGBT community and other minorities are mentioned. The law ""Regarding indigenous peoples"" from Ukraine, which has generated additional inter-ethnic tensions, is also tangentially analyzed. The UN recommends Ukraine to consult more with the representatives of indigenous peoples regarding their rights and aspirations. It is worth mentioning that none of these observations of the UN were mentioned as critical and systemic and do not include immediate recommendations, unlike those regarding Russia, which through recommendations No. 136 and 137 is requested to exert its influence on the self-proclaimed republics of the DNR and the LNR in order to comply with the cessation of hostilities regime the fire and to give up the practice of violating human rights in Crimea.

[...] It is very clear that there are adverse effects that even lead to death and, until this experiment is finished, in December 2023, I will campaign against vaccinations. I request everyone not to vaccinate as long as no one compensates anyone! In case of death, compensate the family of the deceased with five million euros!
Many researchers say that it affects the human genome, which means that it replaces God and changes the structure of DNA, which means that you will no longer be human!

I wonder how many women will be able to procreate in the future... I'm asking the children in Romania, I'm asking the teenagers not to go for vaccinations!"", Sosoaca said in an interview for B1 TV.
NARRATIVE: People vaccinated with vaccines against the coronovirus will become sterile and will transform over several generations into ""pseudo-humans"" from another species.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Senator Diana Sosoaca is one of the main promoters of conspiracy theories related to vaccination, especially the one against the coronavirus. She uses unscientific and populist messages in order to gain popularity and increase her political rating.
Diana Sosoaca's messages fit perfectly with those of the ""anti-vaxxer"" movements of conservative origins, but especially those promoted intensively by the Russian media regarding the ""harmfulness"" of vaccines. Moscow is primarily interested in causing panic among the citizens of the West and obstructing the sanitary measures taken by their governments.
In Romania, such narratives are also promoted by priests from the Orthodox Church among the parishioners. They especially weave apocalyptic stories about what will happen to the vaccinated. For example, that they will turn into zombies with skin full of scales.
There is also talk of a ""world occult"" made up of world leaders and its billionaires whose ultimate goal would be to enslave people.
Also, Diana Socoaca is also a promoter of good relations with Russia and an open admirer of the Kremlin leader, Vladimir Putin.
The senator's populism is rather devoid of any responsibility or civility in a critical situation in which Romania has been registering for two weeks an average of approximately 10,000 cases of new illnesses (over 15,000 on October 5!) with SARS-CoV-2 and over 100 dead daily.
On the other hand, epidemiologists raise an important alarm signal regarding the increased mortality of those who contact COVID-19 in this fourth wave in Romania, in which the deaths caused by this virus have a periodicity already of seven minutes.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing among the population a state of fear and anxiety related to the anti-COVID-19 vaccination with the aim of destabilizing Western states
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Diana Sosoaca's statements are not based on any scientific argument regarding the infertility of those who do not get vaccinated. Moreover, the statements border on ridiculousness and lack of logic. If an individual were sterile, he would not be able to reproduce and after him there would not even be a generation - so, let alone three.

NEWS: The deputy of the Supreme Rada from the ""Opposition platform - for life"" party Ilia Kiva wrote in Telegram that the delivery of Russian gas to Hungary by bypassing Ukraine will ultimately lead to the collapse of the country, reports RIA Novosti.
""The beginning of the end of the Ukrainian economy, and later the collapse of the country... Today Gazprom started supplying gas to Hungary through the Balkan Stream gas pipeline, which bypasses the territory of Ukraine! All this happened due to the reckless criminal economic and political position of the authorities"", wrote Kiva [...]
 ""All this was done to please the American partners and certainly not for free, who wanted so much to sell their liquefied gas to Europe, but they lost the Russian market. And Ukraine, playing together with America in this game, simply destroyed its economy and future. The fatal story of another Afghanistan"", concluded Kiva, quoted by Sputnik.md. NARRATIVE: The delivery of Russian gas to Hungary will cause the collapse of Ukraine
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Hungary signed on September 27 this year a new 15-year natural gas purchase agreement with Gazprom, which will annually deliver 4.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas via two routes: 3.5 billion cubic meters via Serbia and 1 billion cubic meters via Austria . Ukraine has denounced this contract, which it claims threatens its security. ""We consider that this is an exclusively political decision, unreasonable from an economic point of view, taken in favor of the Kremlin and to the detriment of the national interests of Ukraine and Ukrainian-Hungarian relations"", according to a press release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kyiv The Ukrainian side will also address the European Commission to evaluate the compliance of the new agreement with the European legislation in the field of energy, said Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.
Kiev has been saying for a long time that Russia prefers to use natural gas as a geopolitical weapon. Until now, Ukraine and Russia have had 4 major conflicts over gas, in 2005-2006, 2008-2009, 2013-2014 and 2014-2018. Several times Russia tried to determine the geopolitical course of Ukraine through gas delivered at a lower or higher price. Over time, the pro-Russian political formations in Kiev have used the argument that their coming to power will mean cheaper gas for the population. Russia kept blackmailing Ukraine with price increases if the pro-Russian politicians were not in power.
Since 2014, after the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the launch of military actions in Donbass, the topic of gas has become a security issue for Ukraine. Gradually, for Kiev, the price of gas is less important than the problem of the future Ukrainian gas transportation system, which ensures until the construction of the marine pipelines (North Stream, North Stream 2, South Stream etc.) the transportation of gas from Russia to the EU states. Following the construction of North Stream 2, Ukraine risks losing about 3 billion US dollars per year, which represented the tariffs paid by Gazprom for transit.
Therefore, the issue of gas is a painful one for Ukraine. ""The monopolization of gas routes by Gazprom, which we are now observing, raises the issue of the fundamental principles of the functioning of gas markets in the EU - competition and transparency,"" Serghii Makogon, the head of the operator of the gas transport system in Ukraine, said in a statement . Hungary rejected these complaints to it from Ukraine. The Hungarian Foreign Minister summoned the ambassador of Ukraine, accusing an attempt to block the new long-term agreement between Hungary and Russia regarding the supply of natural gas supplied by Gazprom. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of in Budapest, Peter Szijjarto, stated that this constitutes a ""violation of Hungary's sovereignty"". The topic of gas was used by the media controlled by the Russian Government to promote ""apocalyptic"" messages regarding the future of the Ukrainian state, which would have been betrayed by the West again.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the narrative is to sow distrust in the Ukrainian political leadership, but also in Kiev's Western partners. The disinformation seeks to arouse feelings of regret in Ukrainian society following the fact that Ukraine is moving away from Russia, without mentioning the conflict in Donbass, supported by Moscow, or the annexation of Crimea.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the message promoted by the Russian media about the collapse of Ukraine following the delivery of Russian gas to Hungary is not based on economic arguments. The narrative presents Russia as a savior of Ukraine, and the West as an enemy. The contract between Hungary and Russia has nothing to do with liquefied gas from the USA, just as the situation in Ukraine has nothing to do with Afghanistan. Speaking about the thoughtless actions of Ukrainian politicians, pro-Russian parliamentarian Ilia Kiva considers Kiev's policy of distancing itself from the Russian world. It should be noted that the deputy quoted by the Russian media is a member of a pro-Russian party, which often participates in broadcasts of the Russian government television stations, criticizing the pro-European forces in Ukraine most of the time.
Russia has been trying since 2005 to build gas pipelines that would allow it to keep Ukraine in check. During previous energy conflicts, Kiev managed to escape Moscow's blackmail due to its gas transportation system. Relations were built on the informal principle: ""Your blackmail on the price of gas means our blackmail on the price of transit"". Ukrainian military experts are also worried that Russia's renunciation of the Ukrainian transit system could free the Kremlin's hands to start at any moment a war against Ukraine. However, until now, there is a risk of damage to the gas pipelines through which Russian gas reaches the EU.
On the other hand, Ukraine is looking for solutions. There are also some promises from the Western states. The USA and Germany have promised Kiev that they will pressure Russia not to turn gas into a geopolitical weapon and to keep the transit through Ukraine. At the same time, during the recent visit of the Foreign Minister of Ukraine to Berlin, Germany promised to invest in the development of hydrogen-based energy in Ukraine to compensate for economic losses caused by the construction of North Stream 2. Moreover, Ukraine has own gas reserves, untapped continental and maritime wells, which require investments. Therefore, the delivery of Russian gas to Hungary will not cause the collapse of Ukraine, and the ""fatal story of another Afghanistan"" can only take place following military interventions from outside - most likely, from Russia.

NARRATIVE: Romania will go to war because of the new restrictions imposed on the population.
CONTEXT: The PNL congress last weekend, attended by about 5,000 delegates from all over the country, took place without observing many epidemiological protection and social distancing norms, a fact reflected by most of the media present at the event.
There is also a precedent with the former Prime Minister Orban who, in the midst of the pandemic on his birthday in July 2020, called a series of politicians and colleagues with whom he spent time in his office without any of them wearing a mask and respecting social distance.
At the same time, the number of new cases of coronavirus infection rose constantly (over ten thousand per day in the last week of September), which placed Romania on the regional map as one of the countries with the highest infection rate.
For now, the authorities are testing the declarative field regarding mandatory vaccination for certain categories of people and have only started to apply restrictive access measures in certain public spaces or events for those who have not been vaccinated. Romania has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Europe of only 27.44% of the total population, more precisely 5.32 million Romanians on September 28, despite large vaccine stocks that our country has to buy.
The low rate is largely due to distrust of the authorities - caused also by the contradictory measures taken by them - and is stimulated and encouraged by a broad anti-vaccine campaign that, for the most part, takes up disinformation and false narratives launched by Russia and China and, to a lesser extent, some narratives from the alt-right area in the United States.
The opposition to vaccination and its imposition is not a phenomenon that is limited to Romania, it is present in many other countries, where anti-vaccine protests have also taken place. However, these protests did not determine changes in government health policies and were always limited phenomena, never raising the issue of revolutions that would overthrow governments or lead to world conflagrations.
OBJECTIVE: Creating among the population a state of dissatisfaction and inducing the feeling of revolt against the state
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The imposition of restrictions is a necessary epidemiological measure for unvaccinated people who represent a greater risk for the spread of the disease.
The fact that politicians do not respect certain measures and set a bad example for society should not lead to forms of civil disobedience or riots, but to hold them accountable. In fact, in 2020 when former Prime Minister Ludovic Orban did not respect the restrictive measures, he was fined like any other citizen who would have been in his place. But it is a long way from here to revolt and then war by using phrases like ""gunpowder"" or alarming messages that a new World War is starting. Popular discontent can lead, at most, to changes within some states, not to wars between states.Furthermore, the displeasure of those who contest health policies is directed primarily against their own governments, not foreign countries.
Such ideas are folded into the main classic narratives of Russian propaganda that march on riots and isolated incidents in Europe caused by the dissatisfaction of some groups with the restrictions imposed by the pandemic.
Thomas Haldenwang, the president of the German intelligence service ""Verfassungsschutz"", stated in November 2020 when presenting a report on security threats to Germany that ""the Internet channel Russia Today Deutsch and the news agency Sputnik promoted the so-called Hygienedemos and - they exaggerated after that"".
Moreover, he explained that such demonstrations against health protection measures increase extremist parties in the polls and that the number of politically motivated crimes is also increasing. The Russian propaganda channels Russia today and Sputnik media contribute to the encouragement of such behavior on the part of the dissatisfied population.
Sputnik Moldova-Romania regularly publishes such inflammatory news or comments which are then massively sponsored on social networks, especially Facebook. The messages target the Romanian audience dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country regarding the coronavirus epidemic and fuel conspiracy theories and anxiety among the population.
Veridica.ro has repeatedly noticed the fact that the columnist, former director of ZIUA and former convict, Sorin Rosca Stanescu, regularly promotes the themes of Russian propaganda and its well-targeted narratives. Also, there is a media network that takes over such narratives to amplify the propaganda effect, such as Sputnik, CorrectNews, Inpolitics, Ion Cristoiu's blog, even Evenimentul Zilei, etc.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The PNL Congress on September 25 did not respect the health protection rules imposed by the increase in the number of coronavirus cases.

""On September 17, 1939, the Red Army launched the liberation campaign on the territory of Poland. The Soviet forces reached the Curzon line and did not allow the German Wehrmacht army to approach Minsk. The peoples of western Belarus and western Ukraine welcomed the Soviet soldiers with great joy"", it also appeared on the Twitter account of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow, taken over by the Russian press (Lenta.ru, RBK, Novaya Gazeta s.a.) along with a video material that illustrates the ""liberation campaign"".
""According to the documents, the Ukrainian and Belarusian population welcomed the Russian soldiers as liberators. The soldiers at the front were greeted with flowers"", it is stated in the documentary posted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and popularized by the press. NARRATIVE: The Soviet Union did not invade, but liberated a part of Poland in 1939.
CONTEXT / LOCAL ETHOS: Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia and President Vladimir Putin are trying to justify the Ribbentrop - Molotov pact and present it as a necessity of the time, which allowed Moscow to save Eastern Europe from the Nazi genocide. At the same time, Moscow is trying to revive a series of Soviet narratives regarding the communist policy in the states of Eastern Europe.
The narrative about the saving role of the Soviet army is promoted and the crimes committed by the Soviets before, during and after the Second World War are ignored and denied. Such narratives are adapted from one country to another - Veridica recently dismantled one regarding Romania and its ""liberation"" from the Red Army and the Tudor Vladimirescu Division, made up of Romanian anti-fascist volunteers.
The metanarrative about the liberating Soviet army is based on the same scheme: presenting the state that was ""liberated"" (de facto, occupied) as one that did not have enough political will to fight the Nazis, presenting through distorted historical arguments the need for the USSR to defends itself, the presentation of the state attacked by the Soviets as a bankrupt political entity, the ignoring or incorrect presentation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, the extrapolation of the realities of 80 years ago on today's political situation. For example, in the message promoted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, it is mentioned that thanks to the Soviet ""liberators"" Minsk was saved from the Nazi invasion and that the Ukrainians welcomed the Soviets with great joy - an allusion to today's realities in Belarus and Ukraine, in the conditions in which the Kremlin is making efforts to bring them back to the Russian world and targets them with his neo-imperialist project.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia and the Russian press do not really mention the Soviet-German agreements to invade sovereign states, nor the crimes of the USSR (deportations, starvation, political persecution), mentioned, along with those of Nazi Germany, in a resolution of the European Parliament from 2019.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to present the actions of the Red Army as an act of solidarity with the Ukrainian and Belarusian people, who were saved from Nazi crimes following the invasion of Poland.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Soviet Army invaded Poland 17 days after the attack by Nazi Germany. On August 23, 1939, the Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact was signed in Moscow, which stipulated, through its secret agreements, the division of the territories of some sovereign states between the USSR and Germany. In fact, until the invasion of Poland, this state was divided at the negotiating table by the Soviet and Nazi leaders. It is therefore about an act of aggression planned in advance, and not about a liberation campaign.
The notion of ""liberation campaign"" appeared in the Soviet press and in the official speeches of the communist leaders immediately after the invasion of Poland in 1939. According to Soviet historiography, the Red Army liberated western Belarus and western Ukraine from the bourgeois occupation of Poland. Most of the territories, ""liberated"" were joined to the USSR. Until now, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia has not used the notion of ""liberation campaign"" when discussing the events of September 1939. The use of this notion indicates the continued reliance of the Russian political elite on this concept and on the policy of rewriting the history of Eastern Europe.
In reality, the ""liberation"" of Poland was a bilateral German-Soviet campaign of invasion and annexation. The Soviet Union and Germany signed a pact in August 1939, which contained secret protocols for dividing the states of Northern and Eastern Europe in German and Soviet spheres of influence. Germany and the Soviet Union were to rule Poland. The pact gave the Soviets an extra defensive / offensive space in the west, presenting an opportunity to regain the territories ceded by the Peace of Riga and unite the peoples Belarusian and Ukrainian in the east and west under Soviet rule.As in the case of other states, including Romania, the invasion and annexation of Polish territories is presented as an act of liberation, often from an invented foreign yoke.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland reacted to the video clip distributed by Russia's foreign policy department. ""There was no liberation campaign, but an act of aggression, carried out together with Nazi Germany. The Polish state did not cease to exist on September 17, 1939, and the inhabitants of the occupied territories became victims of the crimes of the Soviet state,"" said the press secretary of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lukasz Jasina.

Unfortunately, the probability of refugees entering Moldova exists, considering that a very large flow of refugees is coming, which for now is only stopped by the police measures of the Taliban, and the USA and NATO countries, with which these people have cooperated for 20 years , I definitely don't want to accept them. Nikita Mendkovici, the expert of the Center for the Study of Modern Afghanistan and the Russian Council for International Affairs, spoke about this in the Sputnik Moldova studio.

NARRATIVE: Afghan refugees will be directed by NATO to the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine.
CONTEXT / LOCAL ETHOS: The pro-Kremlin press used the subject of the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and the capture of this state by the Taliban to discourage the Euro-Atlantic efforts of Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. Russian journalists quoted experts close to Moscow, according to which NATO will leave the countries that are not part of the Alliance alone in front of the security problems they face and only Russia has the ability to protect the former post-Soviet states. Through the narratives about the inability of the USA and NATO to react, to defend their partners, to take care of the security of the Eurasian continent, Moscow tries to discourage the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of the former Soviet states. The Russian press presents Moscow as the only security provider in the area and shows the ""powerlessness"" of NATO.
More recently, the crisis in Afghanistan began to be used by the Russian press to feed the fear and frustrations of Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova towards refugees. Russian experts claim that the Afghan refugees will be directed by NATO to the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, and these states will not be protected by anyone. Veridica analyzed, moreover, several narratives launched in the Republic of Moldova, Romania and Ukraine regarding the refugees who knock on the door of these countries. In the Republic of Moldova, distorted information has already been identified, which aimed to create panic in society about the ""invasion"" of the country with Afghan refugees and to inoculate the idea that the pro-European government carries out orders from the outside, to the detriment of its own citizens.
To the same extent, the citizens of Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova follow the events in Belarus and Lithuania, former Soviet states, where there were clear signals of the creation of an immigrant crisis, used by Russia to carry out hybrid attacks against the West. The subject was recently analyzed by Veridica. The crisis in Afghanistan represents a perfect opportunity to reanimate older frustrations from the Syrian refugee crisis, which shook the EU, but also some Eastern Partnership states. The Syrian refugee crisis was used by Russia 6 years ago to launch hybrid attacks against European unity.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the narrative is to sow fear and mistrust in national governments regarding a new wave of refugees and to present NATO as an international organization that will bring Afghans to the former Soviet states.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: There is no document or press statement by some NATO leaders regarding the direction of refugees from Afghanistan to Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. Moreover, the post-Soviet states have never represented a priority for refugees, being, in some cases, only transit territories. Therefore, neither Ukraine nor the Republic of Moldova is an attractive destination for refugees.
The Russian expert assumes, without concrete evidence, that there will be many terrorists among the refugees and accuses the US of sowing chaos in Afghanistan. It should be noted that the expert cited by Sputnik is Nikita Mendkovici, analyst of the Center for the Study of Modern Afghanistan and the Russian Council for International Affairs, but also a member of the Eurasian Analytical Club. The website of this center is regularly referred to by the Russian government press in order to give the published information an ""academic coat"".
Neither the Republic of Moldova nor Ukraine should receive refugees by force, on the order of the USA, as it is said in the narrative promoted by Sputnik.md.
In fact, such messages continue the old ideological line of denigrating the West, of discouraging Euro-Atlantic aspirations in the area. If in August the Russian press wrote that NATO, the EU and the USA left Afghanistan alone in the face of its own problems, mentioning that Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova would be ""betrayed"", now readers find out that the West is ""guilty"" of the future great wave of Afghan refugees, some of whom, say the authors of the narratives, could be terrorists! In this way, the events in Afghanistan are used in the media space to weaken popular support for EU and NATO rapprochement.
NUTS OF TRUTH: There is real fear in Eastern and Central Europe about a possible wave of refugees from Afghanistan. Recently, the Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced that Vienna has prepared 18 million euros to help the refugees who remain in countries neighboring Afghanistan. The majority of political leaders in the European space do not consider that countries outside the EU, which are less attractive for emigrants, could be affected. An alternative, according to the leaders of the eastern EU, would be for the Europeans to appeal, once again, to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who, in 2016, undertook to host millions of Syrian refugees and prevent them from leaving for Europe. in exchange for financial aid from Brussels.

unfortunately, the probability of refugees entering Moldova exists, considering that a very large flow of refugees is coming, which for now is stopped only by the police measures of the Taliban, and the USA and NATO countries, with which these people have cooperated for 20 years , they definitely do not want to accept them. nikita mendkovici, the expert of the center for the study of modern afghanistan and the russian council for international affairs, spoke about this in the studio of sputnik moldova.
""there have already been attempts to impose these refugee flows on the countries of Central Asia, now attempts to impose refugee camps on other countries, which the US perceive as their satellites, are quite likely. The object of such violations could become including Ukraine and Moldova, if the Republic of Moldova will not be able to say ""no"" to her and the European Union"", says the expert.
fanatics among the refugees will indeed be, Mendkovici continued, because there were already examples when among the people who were taken out by the sua, there were also representatives of terrorist organizations. at the same time, the flow of refugees will be used by everyone who wants to.
""under conditions of chaos, without documents, real refugees who collaborated with Americans, criminal elements, terrorists and simply people looking for a better life in new countries could enter. I believe that the flows of refugees from Afghanistan can become a very big problem for the migration and police services"", concluded the interlocutor"", writes sputnik.md."

They were used previously and were now resumed on the occasion of the anniversary of Ukraine's independence.
NEWS: ""At the beginning of the 90s, Ukrainian politicians liked to predict the fate of France for Ukraine. True, we are talking about an equal population (52 and 58.5 million), a similar territory (600 and 640 thousand km.p.), a similar climate, an equally large agro-industrial base...

[...]
From the beginning, Ukraine was divided into three parts: Western European, South-Eastern Russian and Central Ukrainian. The central part was either pro-Western or pro-Russian. Ukraine, however, did not reach any goal during the years of its independence.
[...]
It is a failed state, which exists only because of the will of its neighbors, for whom it is better to have a divided and aggressive country next to them than a parched and desolate land.
As long as there is this will of the neighbors, this state will also be able to exist"", writes Ukraina.ru in an editorial dedicated to social-political developments in Ukraine in the last 30 years.
""Ukraine is a state of permanent failures, which began in 1991. In these years, politicians have been trying to create a Ukrainian nation, but they can only brag now about the fight against the Russian language, culture and history,"" notes Lenta.ru , citing various Russian or pro-Russian politicians from Ukraine.
""Ukraine's biggest mistake in the last 30 years was not the unfounded trust in Russia, but the refusal to be its good neighbor. What came next? The war followed, the division in Ukrainian society, social instability and a great economic crisis"", according to RIA Novosti, which publishes an address of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to Ukrainians on the occasion of Ukraine's independence day. NARRATIVE: Ukraine is an artificial and failed state, which exists only because of a consensus of its neighbors.
CONTEXT / LOCAL ETHOS: On August 24, Ukraine celebrated 30 years since the proclamation of independence. Ukraine's independence and its break from the Russian world are seen critically by Moscow, which regards the ex-Soviet space as its sphere of influence; moreover, the collapse of the USSR was described by the current Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as a geopolitical catastrophe of the last century. Russia forced Ukraine in 2013 to give up signing the Association Agreement with the EU, then, when the pro-Russian regime was overthrown following a popular uprising, it invaded and annexed the Crimean peninsula and fueled the war started by separatists in the east. Moscow also started an informational war, in which it tries to prove that Ukraine is a fake state, which appeared by chance, and without Moscow the ""Ukraine"" political project has no chance to exist for a long time.
Now, on the anniversary of independence, the Russian government press has taken up these theses and published a series of false narratives regarding the socio-political and economic developments in Ukraine over the past 30 years, in the context that 30 years ago there was a lot of discussion in Ukraine about the economic and geographical similarity of Ukraine with France. Many politicians and experts believed that Ukraine has every chance to be as developed as the French state.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the narrative in question is to sow frustration and disappointment in Ukrainian society regarding the achievements of the state in the last 30 years. Also, since only the failures of Ukrainian policies are described, in the eyes of Russian society, Moscow's actions in Crimea and Donbass are justified by relativizing / criticizing the principles of international law.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian media undermines Ukraine's achievements, claiming that its territory and population have decreased, but they do not specify that this process also took place following the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the support of mercenaries from Donbass. Between 2.5 and 3 million people lived in Crimea at the time of the annexation of this peninsula. More than that, the conflict in Donbass, supported directly by Russia, caused a wave of migration, many moved to the center and west of the country, and some - to the EU states or even to Russia. The Russian press does not mention these sad pages in the history of Ukraine, caused by the armed aggression of 2014, blaming only the politicians from Kiev.
The narrative about the division of Ukraine into pro-Russian, pro-European and central-Ukrainian was used by the Kremlin during the election campaigns, especially during the period of the pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, with the aim of fragmenting Ukrainian society. In reality, according to sociological surveys, there have never been dominant pro-Russian attitudes after 2014 in any region of Ukraine. The Russian press resumed the classic narrative about the division of Ukraine to demonstrate that this state project exists only because of the will of the neighbors. Moreover, various fake news about some territorial claims by the EU and NATO states (Poland, Hungary, Romania) towards Kiev are distributed from time to time in Ukraine through social networks. In reality, all these states have repeatedly declared that they support the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine.
Ukraine is not a failed state in the sense of the UN and Fund of Peace definitions (loss of control over its territory or monopoly regarding the legitimate use of physical force within it, erosion of the legitimate authority to make collective decisions, inability to provide public services , the inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community). The Russian press refers to the loss of control over Donbass and Crimea when it characterizes Ukraine as a failed state, but does not specify that without the involvement of Moscow as an external actor, all this would not have taken place. The civil war that Russia claims would take place in Ukraine was sparked and fought with the direct involvement of Moscow, which fueled tensions and supplied weapons and fighters.
A grain of truth: The linguistic division of Ukraine is a truth (the east-west divide), but this division has no (geo)political coloration. Being a Russian speaker does not necessarily mean being pro-Russian. Within the Ukrainian armed forces, for example, there are many Russian-speaking soldiers fighting against Russian aggression.

NARRATIVE: Students from Crimea and Donbass are persecuted in Ukraine
CONTEXT / LOCAL ETHOS: In 2014, after the Euromaidan protests and the impeachment of the fugitive president in Russia, Viktor Yanukovych, Moscow annexed Crimea and launched the war in Donbass. In a part of that region, two self-proclaimed republics were formed and not recognized by the international community - Donetk and Lugansk. Ukraine has launched a military operation to recapture its territories, but thanks to Moscow's direct support, Donetsk and Lugansk continue to be outside the control of the Ukrainian government. Russia is trying to break any links of the local population with Ukraine and for this purpose promotes the false narrative that the Ukrainian state has a Russophobic attitude, fueled by the West, and that this attitude can be seen even in the way it treats Russian-speaking Ukrainians. In this context, the narrative regarding the risks to which the students from the Ukrainian regions controlled by Russia or pro-Russians are exposed also appeared. The narrative in question is a continuation of the classic metanarrative about Russophobia in Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic states, found in several forms on news portals funded by Moscow.
Kyiv started hiding the names of students coming from Donbass and Crimea to the rest of Ukraine in 2016, and the explanation for this decision was provided by the representative of the President of Ukraine in Crimea, with the office in the south of Ukraine. According to the Presidency, there were different situations in the past, when, following the publication of the students' names, the Russian border guards did not allow the young people to enter Ukraine to participate in the registration procedure. Also, the relatives of these students were subjected to persecution.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate to the inhabitants of the Crimean peninsula and the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk that Ukraine persecutes Russian speakers. Russia's goal is to thwart any effort by Kiev to recover and reintegrate these territories.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Deputy Minister of Education did not refer to persecution in the territory controlled by Kiev - the coded names would be given precisely so that the respective students and their families would not be subjected to persecution in the territories controlled by Russia or by funded mercenaries by her.
If the names of the future students become public, according to Kiev's logic, their relatives in Donbass and Crimea could suffer, and the students risk not being able to return home, as happened in the past. For these reasons, but also to encourage them to come to study in the big Ukrainian cities, the Ministry of Education codes the names of the respective students starting in 2016. The Russian press substantially changed the context, writing that in fact the Russian speakers risk being persecuted by the population of Ukraine. To be more convincing, the Russian journalists also published a fragment of the Ukrainian official's speech. Liubomira Mandzii's speech can be viewed in its entirety on the Facebook page of the ""Ukraine-30"" forum. Publication / Media:

While the media institutions close to the pro-European parties revealed alleged cases of bribery of voters from the left of the Dniester, the pro-socialist press emphasized violations in the sections outside the country. One of the main ""arguments"" about the corruption of voters in the diaspora was a short video recorded by a young woman at the polling station in Frankfurt, Germany, in which the voices of several people can be heard saying something about 50 euros and laughing. A number a large number of socialist-affiliated media outlets published news from this recording, suggesting that it was evidence of voter bribery, but its author later clarified that it was only a joke, and the media outlets made erroneous interpretations.
NEWS: ""Moldovans from Frankfurt, Germany, queued up overnight at one of the polling stations. According to images posted on social media, at 4:30 a.m., more than 50 people had already taken a seat to vote starting at 7:00 a.m. At the same time, several scandalous images were placed by an Internet user on a social network. During the discussion between our compatriots gathered in front of the voting station, one of them mentions that they will receive 50 euros each for voting. ""Maybe they will give us 50 euros, they gave us during the presidential elections"", it is mentioned in the video images posted on Facebook by Natalia Mirzenco"", wrote Sinteza.org in a news article entitled ""Scandalous revelations from the diaspora: A to give us 50 EUROS each for one VOTE"".
NARRATIVE: The Right (PAS) cheats the elections at polling stations outside the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The role of the diaspora in the elections has increased significantly in the last polls. There are no exact data on the number of Moldovan citizens abroad, but it is estimated that it would be about 800,000 people, which represents about a quarter of the total number of voters.
In the second round of the presidential elections in November 2020, over 260,000 people voted at polling stations open abroad, which represented 16% of the total number of voters. The diaspora, more active in Western Europe, votes especially with the political right and pro-European parties and practically ensured Maia Sandu's victory in the presidential elections.
In this context, Igor Dodon brought several criticisms to the citizens of the diaspora, including calling them a ""parallel electorate"" and there were even calls for elections not to be organized outside the country.
The organization of elections outside the Republic of Moldova was one of the most disputed topics in the electoral campaign. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration recommended that more than 190 polling stations be opened abroad, but the Central Electoral Commission approved 139 stations, just like in the presidential election. The opposition appealed the decision in court, and in the end the CEC decided to open 150 sections.
During the electoral campaign, the socialists accused the Action and Solidarity Party and the president Maia Sandu of preparing, with the support of the West, the fraud of elections abroad.
On the other hand, the right accused the socialists of preparing to bribe voters from the left of the Dniester, as they would have done in the previous elections. An investigation carried out by Euroreporter, which would be based on information obtained from Igor Dodon's personal phone, claims that the socialists intended to spend one million euros to buy voters from the left of the Dniester.
In this context, the socialist media and those close to the political right competed on Sunday in presenting cases of corruption of voters from the left of the Dniester and in the sections abroad.
At a polling station in Brussels, a man walked out with the ballot paper, according to actuality.md.
Pro TV Chisinau wrote, on the other hand, about alleged irregularities at a section in Moscow, where, traditionally, left-wing parties are voted for, but also about a case in which a woman from the left of the Dniester says that in the previous elections she would have received 25 dollars to vote for Igor Dodon.
The press also published a recording with a man from the left of the Dniester who says that he would have received 200 lei (10 euros) to vote for Igor Dodon, but the institutions affiliated to the socialists say that he is close to the right.
Several publications affiliated with the socialists also wrote about another case of voter manipulation - through song. ""Moldovans from Germany, who came to vote today, are being manipulated through songs"", wrote NTV, which added that the performer of the respective song is a follower of PAS and Maia Sandu.
OBJECTIVE: 1. To inoculate the idea that the right has rigged the elections outside the Republic of Moldova. 2. To divert attention from the accusations regarding the bribery of voters from the left of the Dniester. 3. To mobilize the left-wing electorate inside the country against the ""risk"" that their fate will be decided by those who left. 4. To prepare public opinion for a possible contestation of the elections.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The author of the video recording published by some media as proof of vote fraud abroad later wrote a comment in which she mentioned that the discussion was misinterpreted because, in fact, those who were talking about 50 euros they joked and, indeed, you can hear their laughter during the dialogue.
""Come on, I'm dying of laughter... But I have to make a clarification regarding this video, which was taken over by some ""media sites"" and interpreted wrongly (or rather according to their liking). There were many young people standing in line and waiting to vote. They joked, laughed, sang, etc. Seeing that I was making a video, they also made a joke with 50 euros, but in reality NO ONE has ever been paid for voting!!!, neither last time nor now!!! There are too many of us in the diaspora (nobody has that much money to buy us) and we know what we want for Moldova, because that is where our future and that of our children is!!!!!"", wrote Natalia Mirzenco, the author of the recording.
In the parliamentary election, over 200,000 Moldovan citizens voted outside the Republic of Moldova, which would mean 10 million euros, if we assume that they would have received 50 euros each. It is an enormous amount considering that all the electoral competitors have officially spent approximately two million euros in the electoral campaign.

CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The President of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, built her political career and managed to win the electoral competition for the first position in the state with the help of an anti-corruption speech. However, the president has few levers at his disposal to be able to impose his agenda, given that the executive power is held by a government appointed by the Parliament. The main reason why it was considered that early parliamentary elections were needed was that the former configuration of the legislature - dominated by socialists and parties of some oligarchs who fled the country in order not to pay for the crimes committed - did not reflect the will of the electorate, which opted for Maia Sandu and, implicitly, for her agenda. Officially, Maia Sandu cannot get involved in the electoral campaign, but she supports the party she led until she became president, PAS, and the latter has clearly assumed the president's agenda. Given this close association between Maia Sandu and PAS, discrediting the former reduces the chances of the latter.
On the other hand, the Republic of Moldova is one of the most corrupt European countries, an essential piece in the so-called Russian laundromat (or ""Moldovan mechanism"") from the first years of the last decade, through which an amount of at least 20 billion dollars. Also, around the same period, an amount of about one billion dollars disappeared from the country's three main banks. Endemic corruption keeps Moldova in a gray area, given that the country lacks credibility in the eyes Western politicians and investors. Such a high level of corruption undermines any attempt at European integration, which coincides with Moscow's goals. Apart from Russia, the criminal networks in the CIS space and the corrupt system (with ramifications in the economic, political and justice areas) from the Republic of Moldova are directly interested in the anti-corruption fight not gaining momentum.
The fact that the fight against corruption is a serious concern for certain circles is also the multiplication of narratives against it; Veridica recently wrote about fake news on a similar topic launched by the propaganda arm of the Kremlin, Sputnik.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining formations that have an anti-corruption electoral agenda. Discrediting the fight against corruption, in order to keep the Republic of Moldova in a gray area.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Western partners of the Republic of Moldova (the EU, the United States) demand the consolidation of the rule of law, judicial reform and the fight against corruption, but the issue of blacklists with people who must be arrested has never been raised; on the contrary, the consolidation of the rule of law implies, among other things, even the elimination of arbitrary decisions in justice and removing it from political or economic influence. A rule of law implies predictability and the guarantee that private investments are safe and the eventual assistance granted by different states to the Republic of Moldova is not diverted.

The signatory of the disinformation claims that Moscow should intervene in order not to allow the Republic of Moldova to be ""swallowed"".
NEWS: ""In fact, Romania occupied the Republic of Moldova a long time ago. 90% of Moldovan exports (wine and products) go to ""brothers"", and trade with Russia has been reduced to a minimum. Moldovan students are offered the opportunity to study for free in Romanian universities (usually, most do not return), and the Romanian passport can be obtained as soon as you say"". These are part of the statements of a report published by aif.ru, in which it is stated that the new president from Chisinau, Maia Sandu, could discuss in Parliament the union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania. Most of those quoted in the report have a negative attitude towards Romania, even if some of them hold Romanian citizenship, and at the end the author suggests that Russia should intervene to prevent Romania from ""swallowing"" the Republic of Moldova. NARRATIVE: Romania is getting closer to annexing the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The territory known as Bessarabia was annexed in 1812 by the Tsarist Empire following a Russo-Turkish war. In 1918, after the collapse of the Tsarist Empire, the region was united with Romania, but in 1940 it was occupied by the former USSR, which divided the territory by incorporating the south into Ukraine and forming the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic from the rest.
The subject of the union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania, according to the model of the act of 1918, is constantly discussed after 1991, with the proclamation of the Independence of the Republic of Moldova. The context is currently much more complex, and, according to polls, the majority of the population would oppose such a decision, especially since during the Soviet period, it was Russified and several enclaves inhabited mainly by Russian speakers were created.
However, the number of followers of the union with Romania is increasing, reaching, according to surveys, approximately 30% of the population. However, many agree with the idea of ​​union mainly through the prism of economic gains. A recent sociological research shows that half of those interviewed would vote for union with Romania for the sake of higher salaries and pensions.
The theme of the union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania is also a topic of debate in the electoral campaigns in the Republic of Moldova. Some political forces openly speak for the union of the two states, while others present this possibility as the biggest threat to statehood and invoke memories of the ""Romanian gendarme"" to scare the citizens and increase the Romanophobic spirit.
OBJECTIVE: 1. To present Romania as a state with territorial claims against the Republic of Moldova. 2. To inoculate the idea that the overwhelming majority of the population of the Republic of Moldova is against the union with Romania. 3. To justify an intervention by Russia against the ""danger of the union"".
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Even though Romania is the main commercial partner of the Republic of Moldova and the main destination of Moldovan goods, it does not provide anywhere near 90% of the sales market for the exports of the Republic of Moldova. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2020, the Republic of Moldova exported 28.4% of its goods to Romania. Thus, it cannot be stated that the Republic of Moldova is dependent on Romania in this regard.
Moldovan exports to the Russian Federation fell significantly after 2013 - from more than 600 million dollars annually to slightly more than 200 million - but this happened because Moscow introduced restrictions and customs duties on Moldovan products after Chisinau signed the Association Agreement with the European Union.
Almost 650,000 Moldovan citizens have regained Romanian citizenship in the last two decades, and more than 140,000 applications were pending at the end of 2020, according to information provided by the Romanian Ministry of Justice. However, the procedure is quite complicated and long, usually requiring several years.
And the Russian Federation offers the possibility of obtaining its citizenship for Moldovan citizens. The number of those who have Russian citizenship is not known, the holders usually hiding this fact, because Russia does not allow dual citizenship.
According to the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, a possible decision on union with Romania can only be taken by referendum, with the vote of the majority of registered citizens. Thus, only a president or a pro-union parliament could not make such a decision.
THE NUTS OF THE TRUTH: Romania is the main market for Moldovan goods and offers the possibility of regaining its citizenship.
WHO DO THE NARRATIVES SERVE: Russia, to justify an eventual intervention to strengthen its control over the Republic of Moldova. In the electoral context - the Bloc of Communists and Socialists, to fuel the Romanophobic phobias of a part of the population, a topic used by some politicians in the elections.

NEWS: ""When the quarantine restrictions will be lifted and the meetings in the Minsk format will be resumed, Ukraine will not send its representatives to the capital of Belarus. The Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Oleksiy Reznikov, said this to the ICTV channel""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine interrupts the negotiations regarding the resolution of the conflict in Donbass.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The process in Minsk represents a format of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, with the unofficial participation of the representatives of the separatist republics ""DNR"" and ""LNR"" and under the monitoring of the OSC. There are two Minsk ceasefire agreements, concluded in 2014 and 2015, which regulate the negotiations. After initial discussions in a trilateral format, the agreed points are discussed in the Normandy Four format, where Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia participate. The Minsk agreements are recognized as a diplomatic way to resolve the conflict.
During the pandemic, the Minsk negotiations continued in online format. The Vice-Prime Minister and Minister for the Reintegration of Uncontrolled Territories, Olexiy Reznikov, stated that if the quarantine was lifted, no Ukrainian delegation would travel to Minsk because Belarus is completely under the influence of the Russian Federation, so that Kiev would not has the confidence to send people to that territory.
The authorities in Kiev continue, however, to participate in the negotiations, their only objection being related to the venue after the anti-pandemic restrictions are lifted.
This reluctance to travel to Belarus appeared when, after the outbreak of protests against the fraud of the presidential elections by the Lukasenko regime, Minsk intensified its anti-Ukrainian rhetoric. A narrative of the authorities in Minsk, taken over from Russia, is that the protests in the entire region - including Ukraine and Belarus - were organized by the secret services of the EU and the US. Following those protests, Ukraine would have become a captured state.
Regarding the situation on the ground, Kiev insists that Russian forces must be withdrawn from the territory of Ukraine and the Minsk agreements must be implemented. Russia, on the other hand, presents Ukraine as an aggressor but is consolidating its military presence on the border with this country.
OBJECTIVE: The goal is to show that Ukraine is the one boycotting the negotiation process and preventing a peaceful solution.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The negotiation process is a difficult one, and the negotiations are frequently marked by blockages, to be resumed later, which also happened during the pandemic, in online format. Ukraine did not say for a moment that it no longer wants to negotiate, but only asked that another country be found at the moment when it will move from the online format to face-to-face meetings.

Of course not! Our conclusion? We live on a fooled planet!""
NARRATIVE: The World Health Organization changed the definitions of pandemic and herd immunity in order to be able to declare the COVID-19 pandemic and impose mass vaccination.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHO: The false narrative regarding the invented pandemic (as a result of a conspiracy) is one of the most common in recent years, being promoted by Russian propaganda channels, anti-vaxxers, exponents of the alt-right, followers of conspiracy theories And so on
In this case, the narrative is amplified by Sputnik, which takes over ideas promoted by TV director Razvan Dumitrescu, who, in turn, takes over without quoting. Razvan Dumitrescu has a double argument: the first is linked to an alleged change in the definition of the pandemic, sometime between 2008 and 2011, and the second to the fact that the WHO would have also redefined the notion of ""herd immunity"", stating that it -would only get it through vaccination. Regarding the definition of the pandemic, it is an older dispute that refers to the flu pandemic (not to others). The initial source in the second case seems to be the American Institute for Economic Research which , as Veridica wrote, was ""marked by a series of major controversies, among which the minimization of the risks of climate change and global warming and the publication of a study that seeks to present in a positive light the so-called ""sweatshops"" - the workshops and third world factories working on the edge of legality and paying miserable wages for big western corporations.AIER is part of a network of think-tanks funded by companies in the tobacco and petrochemical industries. The complete resumption of economic activities is in the interest of these large corporations.""
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the efforts to fight the pandemic and the authorities that make these efforts.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The so-called controversy of changing the definition of the pandemic is related to a 2009 communication from the WHO regarding the influenza pandemic (so, not any kind of pandemic, but strictly the one in which the pandemic virus is influenza). The WHO changed the way it described this pandemic, but there was no change in the procedures, the communications to governments, the phases in which a pandemic is detected and decreed in general; regarding the specific flu pandemic, the WHO had nothing to change because, although it had issued numerous warnings and recommendations for the member states, until that moment it did not have a specific, separate definition for the flu pandemic. Therefore, even the case with the modification of the definition for the influenza pandemic is not supported, so its extrapolation to a pandemic caused by another type of virus is without any foundation.
Regarding ""herd immunity"", the World Health Organization has never denied the fact that it can be achieved naturally, by those who survive an infection; the most recently updated definitions clearly specify this.
However, the World Health Organization drew attention to the fact that never in the history of medicine, obtaining herd immunity naturally, that is, by intentionally infecting the population, has never been a strategy. Such an approach would be unethical: the population is consciously exposed to risks, some people may die for the sake of a hypothetical general good, efforts to prevent and save any life are put on the back burner. Consequently, WHO supports obtaining herd immunity through vaccination.
The incriminated article in which the WHO would have redefined the notion of herd immunity appears on November 13 in the section dedicated to vaccination in the Q&A. In the respective material, however, it is recognized that infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides immunity to those who recover; the problem is that it is not known how long this immunity lasts and the use of the method of obtaining immunity through infection exposes the population to unnecessary risks and suffering. The article referred to obtaining herd immunity as a policy/objective, not to herd immunity as a scientific notion. Even this position of the WHO was later rectified.

The NGO resumes the narratives of the USSR regarding the existence of the Moldovan language and people.
NEWS: The ""Stefan's Descendants"" youth movement contests the name of the history subject taught in schools in the Republic of Moldova. The representatives of the association say that both the name - ""History of the Romanians"" and the content of the study program are discriminatory. In a press conference at the IPN, the president of the Movement, Dumitru Roibu, announced that a petition was submitted to the Council for the prevention and elimination of discrimination and ensuring equality.
Dumitru Roibu referred to the data of the last population census, from 2014, mentioning that, out of 2.8 million people surveyed, two million declared themselves Moldovans. Discriminated by the name and content of the subject ""History of the Romanians"" are the children and families who have a different ethnic origin than the Romanian one, the students being required to study the national history ""in the key of Romanianism"", emphasized Dumitru Roibu. According to the activist, history teachers who, perhaps, have a different approach to the discipline taught, can also be considered discriminated against.
Dumitru Roibu mentioned that the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Convention on Human Rights is violated.
The President of the Youth Movement ""Urmasii lui Stefan"" made an analysis of the history textbook for fourth grade students and found that the phrase ""Moldovan"" occurs eight times, while ""Romanian"" in various forms, 92 times. ""In Romania, the discipline taught is called History, and the Republic of Moldova is the only country in which the name of the history discipline also includes the name of an ethnic group: History of the Romanians"", Dumitru Roibu emphasized""
NARRATIVE: The citizens of the Republic of Moldova learn the history of another state/ethnicities, which is discriminatory against the majority of the population of this state.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHO: The content and name of the history course studied in schools in the Republic of Moldova are sensitive subjects, along with the name of the official language and identity issues. The ""History of the Romanians"", studied in schools, has caused debates and dissensions in society since the 90s.
The concepts of the Moldavian language and nation, distinct from the Romanian, appeared in the Soviet period, being used to justify the expansionist claims of the USSR beyond the Dniester and, later, the occupation of Bessarabia and its belonging to the ""Russian world"". Along with the national renaissance since the end of the '90s, efforts have been made to restore the scientific and historical truth.
In 1995, the first attempt to replace the ""History of the Romanians"" with the ""History of Moldova"" caused protests. Another attempt, in 2002, led to the largest and longest demonstrations until then. However, a few years later, the communist government led by Vladimir Voronin managed to replace the ""Romanian History"" textbooks with the so-called ""Integrated History"". The new manuals were criticized by experts and denounced as ""Romanophobic"" and politicized, but also for glorifying the tsarist and Soviet regimes.
After the landing of the communists in 2009, they were withdrawn and replaced with new manuals. Currently, in the schools of the Republic of Moldova, ""Romanian and Universal History"" is studied from textbooks.
Some political forces, led by the Socialist Party, continue to demand the renaming of the discipline in ""History of Moldova"". PSRM has this objective even in its political program.
""Stefan's Followers"" are part of a group of organizations from the Republic of Moldova that promote Moldovanism and Moldovan statism. In the 2020 presidential elections, they openly supported the leader of the socialists and the then president, Igor Dodon.
OBJECTIVE: To emphasize the idea promoted by so-called ""statist"" politicians about the necessity of renaming the subject of history and the program studied in schools.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The ""Romanian and Universal History"" textbooks from which students from the Republic of Moldova study refer to the entire space in which the Romanian countries were established and developed, including the territory of the current Republic of Moldova, and do not make any ethnic discrimination , as the ""Descendants of Stefan"" claim.
In the 4th grade textbook, to which they refer, the terms Republic of Moldova/Republic of Moldova are found approximately 40 times, compared to more than two times less than Romania/Romania
TRUTH: Students from the Republic of Moldova study ""Romanian and Universal History""
WHO DOES THE NARRATIVE SERVE/SERVE THE NARRATIVES: This initiative fits the PSRM discourse about the need to replace the history course studied in the Republic of Moldova.

NEWS: ""The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recalled that the other day the head of the EU Delegation in Chisinau, Peter Michalko, criticized the activity of the Audiovisual Council of Moldova and requested ""the creation of a legislative mechanism to protect Moldova from misinformation from outside.""
Also, in an interview for another publication, Michalko described the laws adopted in the country in December 2020 as ""contradictory and which, in many ways, would lead to the degradation of the country in terms of reforms and the fulfillment of obligations towards partners international"".
""Unfortunately, such statements by the head of the EU Delegation in Moldova, which are an open interference in the internal affairs of the country, are becoming a common practice for him"", it is mentioned in the comment of the Russian Foreign Ministry"", wrote Sputnik.md, but the respective statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was widely taken up by the press from the Republic of Moldova as well as from Russia. NARRATIVE: The EU gets involved in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Russia has recently launched, especially in the electoral campaign for the presidential elections in Chisinau, several attacks on the European Union and the United States, accusing them - through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the espionage service, FSB - of involvement in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova. At the same time, however, President Vladimir Putin wished former President Igor Dodon success in the elections and promised help to the Republic of Moldova in the full electoral campaign.
After the defeat of the candidate supported by Moscow, the Russian MFA made several comments in which they interpreted the statements of the new president, Maia Sandu, regarding the need to withdraw the Russian military contingent. He also indirectly accused Maia Sandu of having any attribution to the decision of the Constitutional Court by which the Law that offered a special status to the Russian language was annulled.
The head of the EU Delegation in Chisinau, Peter Michalko, referred to the inefficiency of the Audiovisual Council in an interview for the Center for Independent Journalism. In another interview, for Cotidianul, the EU ambassador in Chisinau expresses his concern about the fact that people involved in bank fraud are involved in negotiations or the decision-making process regarding the formation of the Government"". He was referring to the deputies of the Sor Party, led by the fugitive politician Ilan Sor, convicted in the first court of involvement in the theft of one billion dollars from the banking system.
These statements provoked reactions both from the Socialist Party, which published a comment on the party's official page, misspelling the diplomat's name, and from the Sor Party.
The ambassadors of 22 EU member states reacted through a joint statement in which they note that ""the ambassadors of the EU and of the EU member states observe internal developments, focusing on the compatibility of internal laws and practices with the international commitments of the Republic of Moldova, including those towards the European Union, in accordance with their mandates and in full respect for the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova""
Later came the comment of the Russian MFA.
It should be mentioned that Peter Michalko was also criticized by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Szijjarto, during his visit to Chisinau, at the beginning of December 2020. He suggested that Michalko would have been involved in the presidential campaign for the presidential elections . On the same day, Igor Dodon decorated the Hungarian official with the ""Order of Honor"".
OBJECTIVE: To present the EU as an international actor that gets involved in the internal affairs of a state (the Republic of Moldova). To try to justify a more active Russian intervention in the region.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Republic of Moldova has an Association Agreement with the European Union, and one of the roles of the EU Delegation in Chisinau is to follow its implementation. It is not a first, or something out of the ordinary, when European officials refer to corruption in the Republic of Moldova, express their concern about the inefficiency of some institutions and the fact that they train the investigation of bank fraud.
In addition, the civil society and mass media from the Republic of Moldova have repeatedly denounced the reduced efficiency of the Audiovisual Council, especially during the elections, something noted by international observers.
