The Scrapers module is responsible for scraping different websites in order to index their content

When running a main file the argumens can be:
    scarpe_all: which scrapes all the data,
    rescrape_faulty: which rescrapes only the elements which are in the faulty list.
        This is for improvements in code for the elements with missing fields.
        If in the faulty files it is added manual_verification TRUE then it just sends manually completed data
        from the file dirrectly to the aggregator
    updates_only: here the code scrapes the wesite and stops at the first element encountered before since it consideres
        that from there on all the data is scraped
