The West loses the war it does not take part in
NEWS: ""Decided, the war is not going well for the West!"" It seems that we are waiting for a long process of ""Order in place"" with ashes in the head. After, in Vilnius, Ukraine's accession was postponed until Saint Wait and Zelenski was sent to the corner, another piece of information blows the whole thing up the official narrative of the last two and a half years. According to Reuters, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres proposed to Vladimir Putin that, in exchange for extending the agreement on grain exports from Ukraine, Russia be reconnected to the SWIFT banking information system. [. ..] The West needs Ukrainian grains to feed its population, while Ukraine needs the grain money to give its suffocated economy a breath of oxygen. [...] The UN Secretary General was put forward , in order to give the proposal as little political nuance as possible and save as much as possible from appearances. However, the reality is relentless: the exchange proposed by the West to Putin is more than a humiliation that will hardly be erased. It is more than a proof that the West is not winning the War in Ukraine. It is a sign that Russia cannot be defeated, nor isolated, and the Putin regime cannot be overthrown, as Biden promised.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The West is going through an economic crisis and only the reconnection of Russia to the SWIFT system can save it. 2. Ukrainian cereals are intended for the Western market, in fact, not for poor countries. 3. Russia is at war with the West.
CONTEXT: The effects of the war in Ukraine are not only felt locally, they reach as far as Africa or the East, turning global food security upside down, strongly influenced by the role played by the two countries in conflict. For example, according to data from the European Commission, Ukraine covers 10% of humanity's wheat needs, 15% of the corn market and 13% of the barley demand. In addition, it is the most important actor on the sunflower oil market, over 50% of the entire global trade. With the launch of the land invasion, Russia also imposed a blockade on Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea, which immobilized huge quantities of grain. Following negotiations mediated by the United Nations and Turkey, Moscow agreed that the export of Ukrainian grain should be done using maritime security corridors up to the Bosphorus, where the ships were controlled by joint commissions. The ships with agricultural products and the ports from where they were going to leave were not allowed to become targets of war.
At the beginning of the month, however, Russia announced that it would end its participation in the agreement for the transport of Ukrainian grain on the Black Sea, arguing that the conditions for its further expansion had not been met and denouncing several obstacles placed by the West in the trade in agricultural products and fertilizers russian Among them are difficulties regarding logistics, payments and insurance, consequences of the suspension of Russian banks from the SWIFT international interbank payment system. As a result, in the last two weeks, United Nations officials held negotiations with the Kremlin to extend the agreement, but which, until this moment, did not have the expected finality.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the anti-Western discourse and, by extension, the anti-Ukrainian one, as well as amplifying Russian sentiments.
Reconnecting Russia to SWIFT, in the Yerevan radio version
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: As I have already shown in Veridica, the sanctions imposed on Russia did not cause an economic crisis in the West, and the fact that Russia is now claiming difficulties in exporting products not subject to sanctions shows that the measures are producing effects. In addition, the European Union did not take into account the reconnection of Russia to the SWIFT system only in the event of the end of the conflict in Ukraine. Russia is the one demanding the reconnection to SWIFT, since the end of last year, conditioning the extension of the ""Black Sea Cereals Initiative"" agreement on the re-admission of Russian banks into the international payment system. As a result, the UN, as an active part of the agreement for the export of Ukrainian grains, negotiated several options to facilitate the export of Russian agricultural products. In this sense, the American bank JP Morgan Chase & Co was going to start processing payments for the export of Russian grains, with insurance from the US government. Also, the UN is working with the African Export-Import Bank to create a platform to help process transactions for Russian grain and fertilizer exports to Africa. And last but not least, representatives of the United Nations negotiated with the European Union to connect a branch of the Agricultural Bank of Russia to the SWIFT system, exclusively for processing payments regarding the export operations of Russian agricultural products not subject to Western sanctions.
The claim that Ukrainian grain actually goes to the European Union and not to Africa and Asia has been promoted by the Kremlin since last year, but, as can be easily verified, almost two thirds of the ships sent from Ukraine are directed to Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Including a good part of the cereals that reach Europe are unloaded for processing and then redirected in the form of flour or derived products to countries at risk of food insecurity.
The false narrative of Russia's war with the collective West was also dismantled in the pages of Veridica. NATO, the EU and no other Western country are not part of the conflict in Ukraine, and the confrontation with the West cannot be considered a defensive war, because Russia was not attacked by anyone, but invaded an independent state. In addition, the Kremlin has failed to provide evidence of actual battlefield confrontations with regular troops of any NATO or EU member state. Publication / Media:

Propaganda: Poland will occupy Ukraine to permanently break it from Russia
NEWS: ""The adoption on July 11, 2023 by the Polish Seimas of a resolution requesting the Ukrainian authorities to condemn the participants in the Volhynia Massacre of 1943 - the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Resurrection Army (banned in Russia) - gives us a series of information about the true purpose of the Ukrainian-Polish rapprochement.
Some believe that Ukraine and Poland are on the threshold of a new Warsaw Union. Part of Ukraine could unite with Poland. Ukraine will not only retain its statehood and identity as an equal autonomous part of a single Polish-Ukrainian state, but will automatically become a member of both NATO and the European Union.
The divine service attended by the presidents of Ukraine and Poland Volodymyr Zelenski and Andrzej Duda in Lutk was even dedicated to this event [...].
The current Polish-Ukrainian pseudo-reconciliation and the merging of the parties into a single state is based on the immoral renunciation of the historical past for political purposes. They want not only the withdrawal of Ukraine from the zone of geopolitical influence of Russia at any cost, but also the opposition of the Ukrainians to the Russians, the transformation of Ukraine into an instrument of war against Russia.
Both peoples are forced to trample on historical memory, having a past sprinkled with the blood of their ancestors. It was forgotten that the history of the two peoples represents a continuous war with elements of mutual genocide"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine will become part of Poland in order to be part of NATO and the EU
Reality: Poland supports Ukraine in the context of Moscow's large-scale invasion, with a reconciliation of the two sides taking place in parallel
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukraine and Poland are making more and more efforts for historical reconciliation. The presidents of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenski, and of Poland, Andrzej Duda, commemorated on July 9 this year. the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles by Ukrainian nationalists during the Second World War, crimes that represented a source of tension between Kiev and Warsaw.
The resolution of the Polish Seimas of July 11 does not refer to any union of the two states, but represents a point of view of the Warsaw legislature on the tragic pages in the history of the two states. According to the resolution, both states must recognize the mistakes of the past and commemorate together the victims of the massacres during the Second World War. The meetings and joint statements of the leaders of the two states are proof of the gradual reconciliation of both sides in the context of the large-scale invasion of Russia.
According to the Russian government media, the reconciliation between Poland and Ukraine has a temporary character, Warsaw being accused of opposing the Ukrainians against the Russians. Any rapprochement between Ukraine and its western neighbors is presented by Russian journalists as an existential danger for Russia.
The Russian press intentionally misinterprets the recent political-diplomatic events, arguing that the increasingly frequent contacts between Ukrainian and Polish politicians are proof of Warsaw's territorial interests vis-à-vis Kiev. Moreover, in the context of Kiev's repeated requests to speed up the NATO and EU accession process, Russian propaganda claims that Ukraine's accession to Poland will mean Kiev's entry into NATO through the back door.
In reality, even according to this hybrid logic, the entry of a state into the component of another state means the loss of independence. A region of a state cannot have NATO or EU member status. The arguments presented in the press article are completely disconnected from reality.
In another vein, Poland was one of the most important supporters of Ukraine in the context of Russia's large-scale invasion. Warsaw demonstrated through actions that it is a real supporter of Ukraine: it condemned the Russian aggression, supported the Ukrainian army, facilitated the institutional approach of Kiev to the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Poland is one of the staunchest supporters of sanctions against Moscow. At the same time, Poland accepted that the main transit routes for the weapons that the West delivers to Ukraine should be developed on its territory.
The Polish state introduced sanctions against Russia after February 24, 2022 and requested the EU and NATO to provide Ukraine with heavy weapons. Warsaw expressed its desire to have nuclear weapons placed on its territory and supported the territorial integrity of Ukraine at all international forums.
Warsaw's actions are not determined by the desire to expand territorially to the detriment of Ukraine (which would contradict its status as an EU and NATO member), but by the fear that Poland will be Moscow's next target. Despite the diminishing fears regarding the invasion of Poland by the Russian army, after almost 17 months of war in Ukraine, sociological surveys show Russia as the main enemy of the Poles.
The reconciliation between Poland and Ukraine takes place in a difficult geopolitical context. ""Russia will never win if a Pole and a Ukrainian stand side by side. We remain together in this war and we will enjoy together in peace"", declared Volodymyr Zelensky in the spring of this year, sparking critical reactions in Moscow.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives by Russia regarding a possible aggression of Poland on Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that a referendum on joining Poland will be organized in the Lviv region, after which Warsaw will start a war against Russia. The publications from Moscow tried to convince the public opinion that Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to capture a part of Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Belarus and Russia are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and possible NATO aggression. Publication / Media:

The infinite pandemic, the secret dream of conspiracy theorists
NEWS: ""In Peru yesterday, a state of emergency was declared after the cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome increased in a bizarre way. [...] A few billion dollars were allocated at the beginning, with the funds expected to increase with the establishment of the state of emergency. The exact cause of this disease is unknown, but 2/3 of patients diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome reported symptoms after being infected with Covid, the Zika virus or after vaccination. There is no treatment. The future looks bleak, especially if we consider the connection between this bizarre syndrome and vaccination or infection with Covid. Iosefina Pascal wonders if we won't wake up with the establishment of a state of emergency for cardiovascular diseases, thus creating a kind of pandemic without end.""
NARRATIVES: 1. Anti-Covid19 vaccines are the cause of the Guillain-Barre syndrome epidemic in Peru. 2. Under the pretext of some preventive measures, the globalist elites will impose more and more restrictive measures on humanity.
CONTEXT: Since the beginning of history, humanity has faced epidemics of various proportions, from the medieval plague or cholera in the 19th century to the Ebola, SARS or MERS epidemics, as well as the Spanish flu, smallpox, AIDS or Covid19 pandemics recent. Historians record such moments in the life of different societies since the 5th-4th centuries BCE, but there are also sources dating back to around 1000 BCE. In all cases, the authorities had to institute a series of exceptional measures, some of which are restrictive, in order to limit the spread of diseases. Quarantine - the practice of preventing people on board a ship from disembarking in port for forty days to eliminate the possibility of them spreading epidemics - is probably the most well-known such measure, being applied long before the outbreak the term in the Middle Ages.
""State of emergency"" is a legal concept that represents a set of such exceptional political, economic and public order measures, which apply at the regional or national level, and can be instituted in the context of the existence of serious dangers regarding national security or safety and the state of health of the population. It creates an exceptional legal framework, in which certain procedures can be expedited, bypassing the bureaucracy and reducing execution times, for the efficiency of the chain of preventive measures.
The practice of emergency situations is not unusual for Peru, a country that faces various social problems caused by political instability, but also extreme natural phenomena, from floods to volcanic eruptions. Since the beginning of the year, in addition to the current sanitary one, four other states of emergency have been declared, in the winter due to anti-government demonstrations, in the spring due to the large influx of migrants from Haiti and Venezuela, in the early summer due to the floods caused due to heavy rains, and a week ago due to the eruption of a volcano in the south of the country. This fact allowed the Lima government to intervene more promptly and more efficiently in all the above cases, ensuring, at the same time, a better awareness of the problems on the part of the population, as well as a better collaboration of the authorities with it.
OBJECTIVE: Reducing the population's trust in the authorities, provoking and amplifying possible social tensions.
Medicine behind the ear has no treatment
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Guillan-Barre syndrome is an inflammatory condition of the peripheral nervous system of autoimmune cause, characterized by muscle weakness and paralysis of several muscle groups. The causes of its occurrence are not fully elucidated, but doctors say that the main risk factors are viral or bacterial infections, which cause an exacerbated immune response in which antibodies are generated that affect myelin, i.e. the outer covering of peripheral nerves, and lead to the appearance of specific symptoms of the disease. Contrary to Iosefina Pascal's statement, in two thirds of cases, the disease appears after an infectious gastrointestinal or respiratory episode with numerous viruses (herpesvirus, HIV, cytomegalovirus, measles, rubella, urlian, Zika, etc.) or bacteria (especially Campylobacter jejuni), and not after vaccination. In addition, the disease has an incubation period between 1 and 30 days, with an average of 10-20 days, which minimizes the probability that the anti-Covid19 vaccines administered at the earliest a year ago are the cause of the outbreak the epidemic. Also, contrary to conspiracy claims, there is a treatment for the disease, which involves plasmapheresis and infusions of human immunoglobulins in large doses.
However, a large amount of immunoglobulin is necessary, and this is the reason that led to the declaration of the state of emergency in Peru, as an official from the Ministry of Health in Lima said: ""With the declaration of the state of emergency, we will be able to buy at at the ministry level, immunoglobulins, which are expensive treatments and could not be bought before because they were not considered essential."" According to the same sources, the budget for this purchase is 3.5 million dollars and not ""a few billion dollars at started, following that the funds will increase with the installation of the state of emergency"", as the Gold FM material claims. Otherwise, the population of Peru is not subject to any kind of ban, invalidating the apocalypse predicted by those who predict the closure of humanity in 15-minute cities or its control through digital currencies or artificial intelligence.
In fact, the narrative of a pandemic with repetition on the South American continent has been circulated since the spring, the current one only changing the disease and slightly narrowing the location of the ""experiment"".
NUTS OF TRUTH: according to the leaflet of the anti-Covid19 vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson, in the chapter Warnings and special precautions for use, Guillain-Barre Syndrome has been reported very rarely after vaccination, and doctors are advised to be attentive to the symptoms to establish a correct diagnosis and to initiate the appropriate treatment, excluding at the same time other causes of the onset of the disease.

It argues that the Moldovan authorities would have been informed ahead of time, while Chisinau answers that the information about the criminal was published later. Maria Zaharova's statements were widely reported by the press from Moscow and Chisinau.
Russia: if Moldova does not distance itself from the CIS, it was informed that the attacker is a criminal
NEWS: ""If the Chisinau authorities had continued to collaborate with CIS structures and use its [databases], they would have managed to identify the criminal in time and avoid the tragic deaths of two people,"" said the representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Maria Zakharova.
She mentioned that the shootings at the Chisinau Airport were a consequence of the de facto cessation of Moldova's participation in the Coordination Office of the Fight against Organized Crime"".
[...] ""Previously, the authorities of Moldova spoke about the phased exit from the CIS, declaring that further collaboration within the community is useless. Consequently, the Moldovan law enforcement agencies did not receive prior information about the dangerous foreigner"" (eadaily.com)
""The shootings at the airport in Chisinau were the result of the de facto termination of the participation of the Republic of Moldova in the CIS Office for the Coordination of the Fight Against Organized Crime,"" said the spokeswoman of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zaharova.
""Unfortunately, Chisinau's position (in the field of security - TASS note) already has negative consequences for the citizens of the Republic of Moldova. The recent tragic incidents at the Chisinau airport are a direct confirmation of this fact. This is one of the consequences of the de facto cessation of the country's participation in the activity of the Office for Coordination of the Fight against Organized Crime and other types of dangerous crimes in the CIS and the recall of Moldova's representative from this structure,"" said the diplomat.
According to Maria Zaharova, it is not excluded that if the authorities from Chisinau had continued the collaboration with this structure of the CIS and had used its databases, they would have succeeded in identifying the criminal in due time"". (tass.ru)
NARRATIVES: 1. The armed attack on Chisinau Airport is a direct consequence of the distance of the Republic of Moldova from the CIS. 2. CIS is a security factor for the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On June 30, at the Chisinau International Airport, a citizen of Tajikistan who had been banned from entering the Republic of Moldova managed to steal the gun from a border policeman who was escorting him and fatally shot him and a security officer . Later it was found out that the Tajik citizen was being prosecuted in his native country for the kidnapping of a bank manager. Following an exchange of fire with the intervention teams, Rustam Asurov was seriously injured and died a few days later at the hospital.
Maria Zaharova's statements regarding the CIS were made in the context of an increasing distance between Chisinau and Moscow, especially after the large-scale invasion of Ukraine. In June 2022, the Republic of Moldova obtained the status of a candidate country for EU accession, and since then several Moldovan officials have made statements about gradually leaving the CIS, an organization that is less and less relevant from an economic point of view.
In May, the Parliament denounced the agreement regarding the participation of the Republic of Moldova in the activity of the radio and TV company from the CIS ""MIR"", and currently the denunciation of the Agreement regarding the participation of the Republic of Moldova in the inter-parliamentary assembly of the CIS is in the process. also targeted, and others, less known.
Meanwhile, Russian propaganda and officials from Moscow talk about the benefits that CIS membership brings to the Republic of Moldova and accuse the West of causing the country to leave this organization.
The CIS was established in 1991 against the background of the breakup of the former USSR and was always seen as the organization through which Moscow tried to maintain its sphere of influence in the ex-Soviet states. The Baltic countries did not join the organization, and Georgia left it in 2008, after the Russian invasion. Even Ukraine is no longer, de facto, a member of the CIS, even if it has not completed the withdrawal procedures from this organization.
OBJECTIVE: To emphasize the risks and negative aspects of the detachment of the Republic of Moldova from the CIS and the eastern space.
Reality: the notification regarding the suspect had not even been issued, and Chisinau had anyway forbidden his access to the country
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In fact, the main risks and threats to the security and safety of the Republic of Moldova, especially after the Russian invasion in Ukraine, come precisely from the Russian Federation, the ""first violin"" within the CIS. In the first days of the war, both the officials Moldovans, as well as international experts and politicians mentioned that Moldova is the most vulnerable country in the region in the face of a potential invasion and would be the next target after Ukraine. Belarusian President Alexander Lukasenko appeared at that time next to a map that also indicated the alleged directions of attack on Republic of Moldova (Transnistrian region).
Although the danger of a military invasion has decreased compared to the first months of the war, due to the resistance of the Ukrainian army, the Republic of Moldova is the target of a hybrid war from Russia.
At the beginning of February, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, declared in Brussels that the secret services of his country have information in this regard. Shortly after, the presidency in Chisinau and the Information and Security Service confirmed that they were aware of such a plan. Later, the White House described as ""deeply worrying"" the information about Russia's plan to destabilize the political situation in the Republic of Moldova. Recently, Washington accused Russia of trying to destabilize the situation in the Republic of Moldova. On March 14, the European Parliament also debated the situation in The Republic of Moldova and the challenges that the authorities in Chisinau have to manage during this period.
All this information shows that the CIS, de facto controlled by Moscow, does not represent a security factor for the Republic of Moldova, on the contrary.
In addition, the authorities in Chisinau are fighting the main argument invoked by Moscow, namely that maintaining close collaboration relations within the CIS would have made it possible to avoid the loss of human lives, because the Republic of Moldova would have been informed in time. The Ministry of Internal Affairs from Chisinau specifies that the Office for Coordination of the Fight against Organized Crime and other types of dangerous crimes in the CIS, coordinated by the Russian Federation, did not have data about the attacker from Tajikistan who killed two people at the airport in Chisinau, ,, because the authorities of this country sent search data for this person in the international environment after the tragic incident at the airport, resulting in two deaths"".
Finally, the Tajik citizen was denied access to the territory of the Republic of Moldova anyway and, according to standard procedures in such situations, he was escorted to a transit/departure area. Therefore, measures were taken even without the existence of a notification.
THE NUTS OF TRUTH: The Republic of Moldova has started a process of denouncing agreements within the CIS that it does not consider important.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Ministry of Internal Affairs rejected that the Office had information about the Tajik citizen. ""Interpol, Europol and the interstate search mechanism in the CIS space did not register the search for Rustam Asurov, because on June 30 the authorities in Tajikistan were just preparing the international search file in his name. Therefore, the statement made by the Russian official is false, given that the CIS authorities had no data or active search file on the name of Rustam Asurov. The Republic of Moldova has recalled the liaison officer from the Coordination Office for the Fight against Organized Crime and other types of dangerous crimes in the CIS, from Moscow under the conditions that personnel policy requires the concentration in Chisinau of specialists in combating cross-border organized crime, generated the risks of the war taking place in the neighboring country, Ukraine. The officer was retired in January 2023"", according to a press release from the institution. Publication / Media:

It cites, in fact, only one MEP, known for his collaboration with Russia.
Propaganda: The war in Ukraine is happening because of the West, which does not accept Russia's conditions
NEWS: ""During the session of the European Parliament, an urgent solution to the conflict in Ukraine was requested, based on the Kremlin's conditions. A statement in this sense was made by the MEP Herve Juvin.
Peace will be established only when the countries of the West accept Russia's demands.

NARRATIVE: A peace plan proposed by Russia is increasingly supported in the EU.
Reality: The EU leadership condemned Russia's unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, and the Russian press cited a member of the European Parliament who collaborates with Moscow
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media presented the statement of MEP Herve Juvin as a point of view of the European Legislature, mentioning that EU states are beginning to understand that peace in Ukraine is impossible without taking into account Russia's conditions. In reality, Herve Juvin does not represent the EU or the European Parliament. On the contrary, the politician has become in the last eight years a star of the propaganda of the Russian Federation, being the spokesperson of the ""National Front"" party, financed by Russian banks. Juvin has been quoted by the Russian government press on various occasions. Among his statements the most scandalous, we mention the accusation of NATO for starting the war in Ukraine and the requests to the leadership of France to leave the North Atlantic Alliance.
Herve Juvin was invited by Moscow to visit Crimea several times, where he participated as an observer in various elections not recognized by the international community. He expressed his admiration for the smooth conduct of the recent referendum for the annexation of the peninsula to Russia and spoke for the international recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. Herve Juvin has been repeating various propaganda narratives of the Kremlin for several years, including those regarding Russia's legitimate claim to build a multipolar world and eliminate US dominance in international relations.
It should be noted that a resolution of the European Parliament says that Russia ""sponsors terrorism and uses terrorist means"" in its war in Ukraine, committing ""war crimes"". The EU has repeatedly condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine, and European states support Kiev's defensive efforts. The EU stands in solidarity with Ukraine and will continue to resolutely support the economy, society, the armed forces and the future reconstruction of Ukraine, according to the EU Council. During the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in February 2023, EU leaders reiterated their support for Ukraine's initiative for a just peace, including President Zelenski's 10-point peace plan. There is no official document or statement by a European official that recognizes Russia's conditions for peace in Ukraine as legitimate.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that NATO supports Ukraine to cause a world war, while Russia and China want peace on the globe. According to Russian propaganda, the EU sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022 to weaken Russia, and the UN denounced the crimes committed by Ukrainian nationalists. Publication / Media:

CNAIR, espionage agency
NEWS: ""Be careful how loud you are."" Parliament quickly passed a law that will make life impossible for those who use personal cars. Thus, the fees for using the roads will be calculated according to the pollution norm and the duration of the infrastructure. There is also a computer application developed for mobile phones that uses satellite localization. In this case, it is not about a new ruin, but about the supervision of CNAIR. You can't live on this planet anymore, baby! It seems that, for the fact that I am alive, I should thank the Government. It's normal to follow polluting cars, but not everyone, that's not normal. [...] And this is the global trend. Don't think that he got hold of these people, from below, the Romanians, that they are innovative. On the world level, it's the job, tatoo! Yes, one can no longer live peacefully on this planet."" - YouTube channel - In the mouth of the press with Mircea Badea
NARRATIVE: The new road tariffs will allow the implementation of additional restrictive measures against the population.
CONTEXT: Several European states provide in the road legislation for the payment by car owners of certain ""road taxes"", whose purpose is to cover or contribute to the costs of building new roads and maintaining the existing infrastructure, reducing traffic peaks by applying higher prices in more congested periods and areas, or reducing pollution by applying lower rates to less polluting vehicles. Last week, the Romanian Parliament adopted a draft law on the application of new road rates on the national road network. The measures are intended to align the Romanian legislation with the rules approved five years ago by the European Parliament, the purpose of which is to guarantee equal treatment of road users and to help the member states achieve their objectives of reducing CO2 emissions. carbon in the transport sector.
OBJECTIVE: Reducing the population's trust in the authorities, provoking and amplifying possible social tensions.
Monitoring of freight transport already exists
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The measures voted by the Parliament will enter into force from 2026 and differentiate, from the point of view of the payment obligation, vehicles for the transport of goods from those used in personal interest. Thus, the car owners will pay the toll depending on the degree of pollution of the car and the duration for which they purchase it, and the cargo trucks will pay a road tariff, called TollRo, which will be established according to the distance traveled. Therefore, in terms of personal cars, they will not be monitored during travel, but only regarding the payment of the toll, through a computerized monitoring and management system, as is currently done. In addition, the regulation does not cover the inner-city areas, where the majority of cars in Romania circulate.
Indeed, the law provides for the voluntary installation of a mobile application by freight and passenger carriers, but this is only one of the three ways to pay TollRo, the rate that will be applied to all vehicles designed and built for the transport of cargo with a maximum authorized total weight greater than 3.5 tons. However, the monitoring of transporters is not a novelty, it has been centralized, at the national level, for a year, through the RO e-Transport system. In addition, most transport companies have vehicle fleet monitoring systems that allow the identification of the driver in real time and the generation of reports to highlight his activity. These applications even generate reports about the driver's driving style, even issuing alerts in case of violation of traffic restrictions and highlighting the driving times and breaks taken by him.

NARRATIVES: Maia Sandu and PAS established a dictatorial regime in the Republic of Moldova, which manifests itself through the persecution of the opposition, control over the justice system, censorship, political police, etc. The regime maintains its power by maintaining the state of emergency, eliminating unsuitable candidates, arrests, pursuits and media lynching of the opposition, the use of special structures as political police, the use of administrative resources to promote their own projects.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Maia Sandu and PAS came to power with strong pro-European messages, but also of justice reform and the fight against corruption. The PAS government began against the backdrop of the Covid 19 pandemic, followed by the post-pandemic inflation that hit most of the world's economies, and from February 2022 it had to manage the effects of the war in Ukraine - insecurity and the risk of a military invasion, waves of refugees and the growth and more vertiginous inflation, but also an energy crisis.
The wave of price increases served as a reason for massive anti-government protests, and the PAS government and Maia Sandu were accused of not knowing how to manage the crisis, especially to obtain a lower price for natural gas from Russia.
On the other hand, the government in Chisinau condemned the Russian invasion and offered humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian refugees and strengthened relations with the West from which it managed to obtain substantial financial support to deal with the crises. In June 2022, the Republic of Moldova, together with Ukraine, obtained the status of a candidate country for EU accession.
Chisinau's position towards the war in Ukraine and its approach to the EU caused Moscow's displeasure and sharpened the propaganda messages of the Russian media and officials, as well as the pro-Russian ones from Chisinau. Among the most frequently promoted narratives are those regarding the imminent involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the war, the accession to NATO, despite the opposition of the majority of citizens, the union with Romania, the transformation of the country into a theater of war, but also the establishment of a dictatorial regime in Chisinau.
OBJECTIVE: To present the government from Chisinau as a dictatorial regime to associate with the one from the time of the PDM and Vlad Plahotniuc. To justify the anti-government protests organized especially by the fugitive politician Ilan Sor, considered to have been advised by representatives of the Russian secret services.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The state of emergency. In the Republic of Moldova, a state of emergency was decreed after the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, when PAS was not in power. The state of emergency was subsequently extended several times, also to combat the pandemic, and later due to the energy crisis in the fall of 2021. Starting on February 24, 2022, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a state of emergency was decreed again , in the context in which the Republic of Moldova, which has over 1,200 km of common border with Ukraine, is considered the most vulnerable country in the region to an attack by the Russian Federation. At the beginning of the war, when few experts expected such a strong resistance of the Ukrainian army, the Republic of Moldova, with an influential Russian-speaking minority and a pro-Moscow secessionist region, was considered Moscow's next target. Shortly after, a large number of Ukrainian refugees came to Moldova, a crisis that it managed very well, as noted by international organizations. The war in Ukraine caused an increase in inflation to over 30%, including an energy crisis, initially due to high prices, and in the fall of last year due to insufficient gas and electricity, so that the state of emergency was extended every two months.
In recent months, there has been increasing talk, both in Chisinau and in Western chancelleries, about an alleged plan by Moscow to destabilize the internal situation of the Republic of Moldova, including through protest actions, whose organizer would be the Sor Party.
The state of emergency was extended in the context of ""persistent risks and threats aimed at national security, the supply of the Republic of Moldova with electricity, as well as acts of sabotage in the judiciary, which amplify attempts to destabilize the country and create impediments in the accession process of our country to the European Union"", according to Prime Minister Dorin Recean.
The Constitutional Court has rejected in several lines notifications of the opposition that demanded the annulment of the state of emergency.
It controls the state bodies, the judicial system. Like any government, PAS changed the leadership of several state institutions, including the law enforcement agencies. But this is not an argument that they commit illegalities or abuses. On the contrary, the judicial system seems to sabotage the attempts to reform justice, as it demonstrated in the spring, when it tried to block the appointment to the Superior Council of the Magistracy of some members proposed by a commission made up of foreign experts that verified the integrity of the candidates.
He introduced censorship. It is an accusation heavily promoted by Russian propaganda, argued in particular on a decision of the Exceptional Situations Commission from December 2022, which suspended the licenses of six television stations, accused of manipulation. In the last two years, the Republic of Moldova has climbed over 60 positions in terms of press freedom and reached the 28th place in the world. Veridica has several times dismantled Russian propaganda narratives related to the establishment of censorship in the Republic of Moldova
Eliminate unsuitable candidates from the elections. The author is most likely referring to the exclusion from the electoral race for the mayor of Balti of the candidate of the Sor Party, Marina Tauber. It was eliminated after the state institutions accused it of electoral fraud. The decision was taken by a court in Balti. In fact, the candidates of this political formation were removed from several campaigns - the presidential elections of 2016, local elections of 2018, parliamentary elections of 2020. And in the elections for the position of Basque of Gaigauzia, held in 2023, there were accusations of fraud committed by the representative of the Sor Party, Evghenia Gutul, but the vote was validated.
It persecutes, until the total ban, the opposition political parties. It is probably about the declaration of the unconstitutionality of the Sor Party, a group created and led by the fugitive oligarch Ilan Sor, convicted in the large-scale bank fraud case of 2014, who was allegedly associated with representatives of the Russian secret services.
He did nothing to punish the culprits for the theft of the billion and recover the damages. The government should not take care of punishing the guilty, and the recovery of damages largely depends on the decisions of the courts or the actions of the prosecutor's office. It should be noted, however, that on April 13, Ilan Sor, one of the main characters of the bank fraud, was sentenced definitively, being forced to return more than 5 billion lei, i.e. more than a third of the amount of the damage.
It practices arrests, pursuits and media lynching of the opposition, uses special structures as secret police. It is true that some opposition leaders were detained in the last year. It is primarily about the former president, Igor Dodon, and the vice-president of the Sor Party, Marina Tauber. Igor Dodon appears in several cases of corruption, but also of treason, and Veridica has previously dismantled forgeries related to his files. Marina Tauber also appears in several files related to the illegal financing of her formation, she was detained several times, and the Information and Security Service participated in some investigative activities, but this is not a unique case.
It uses administrative resources to promote its own projects, such as the National Center for Information Defense and Combating Propaganda - Patriot and a support fund for loyal media. The presidency has indeed developed a draft law on the creation of a structure to fight against propaganda. It is not known if and how much money was spent for the elaboration of a draft law. There is also a draft law on the creation of a subsidy fund in the media field that offers equal opportunities to media institutions to benefit from support, the prohibitions being clearly established (institutions financed by public money, by political parties, etc.). Decisions will be made by a council of experts, most of them appointed by civil society. The law has not yet been voted, the fund has not yet been created, respectively there is no proof that the ""loyal press"" will be supported. Publication / Media:

In fact, the opening of a National Military Memorial was requested.
Propaganda: Following the unsuccessful counteroffensive of Kiev, the Ukrainian soldiers killed by Russia have nowhere to be buried
NEWS: ""In Kiev, there was an action organized by the relatives of the soldiers killed in the Azov regiment (a terrorist organization banned in Russia), who demanded an increase in the number of cemeteries in Ukraine.
The organizers of the action declared that the lack of places in cemeteries for the killed soldiers is becoming a national problem in Ukraine and pushes people to organize rallies [...].
The unsuccessful counter-offensive of the Ukrainian army generated a very large number of victims among the military personnel. All morgues and all cemeteries are full of killed fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The old unmarked graves are dug in Lviv due to the lack of space in the cemetery. In Ivano-Frankivsk, the cemetery has grown so much that the municipality decided to open there stations with electric scooters that can be rented to reach the graves.
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainians demand the opening of new cemeteries to have a place to bury the soldiers who died on the front.
Reality: In Kiev there was a rally of the relatives of the soldiers killed by Russia for the opening of a National Military Memorial
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russian government media presents a rally organized by relatives of Ukrainian servicemen for the opening of a National Military Memorial as a protest against the war. The context of the news is distorted to manipulate public opinion.
Most of the press bodies in Kiev reported on the dissatisfaction of the relatives of the Ukrainian soldiers who fell on the front because of the delay in the opening of the Memorial. It is about the establishment of a cemetery where the heroes of the war, who gave their lives for the future and freedom of Ukraine, will be buried. The participants in the mass action asked the Ukrainian authorities to expedite this process, and to build a National Military Memorial near Kiev.
It should be noted that on May 31, 2022, the Supreme Rada of Ukraine adopted the National Military Memorial Law to honor those who fell in the war. According to this law, a local memorial will be created in each locality, and the town halls must provide land for this purpose. The blocking of this process in some regions of Ukraine generated dissatisfaction in society in the context of the continuation of hostilities.
The Russian government press distorted the context of this information, mentioning that following the unsuccessful counteroffensive of Kiev, the Ukrainian soldiers killed by Russia no longer have a place to be buried. The creation of the National Military Memorial and the local memorials has nothing to do with the Ukrainian counteroffensive, being a legislative obligation of the Ukrainian state assumed since 2022. According to the associations of war veterans in Ukraine, the National Military Memorial must be located near the Bikivnia Mounds, where the Ukrainians who are buried are buried were persecuted by the Soviet regime. According to the Ministry of Culture, the National Military Memorial will be modeled after the Arlington Cemetery in the USA.
Therefore, a rally of the relatives of soldiers killed by Russia took place in Kiev for the opening of a National Military Memorial, an event that has nothing to do with the Ukrainian counter-offensive. Publication / Media:

In reality, it is Moscow that kidnapped and deported Ukrainian children.
Propaganda: Ukraine does not defend its refugee minors on EU territory
NEWS: ""Russia will defend the Ukrainian children taken by the European authorities. Following the unresolved issues, Ukrainians will understand that they must obtain Russian citizenship.
Russia will have to help the Ukrainian refugees, whose children were taken by the guardianship authorities in Europe. Moscow can only help those who have Russian citizenship. Otherwise, Russia has few levers of influence on the situation, Maria Lvova-Belova, representative of the Office of the Commissioner for Children's Rights under the President of the Russian Federation, said for URA.RU, commenting on the statement of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov regarding the creation of a parliamentary commission [ ...].
""We receive a lot of complaints from Ukrainian citizens who went to Europe as refugees against the authorities who forcibly take their children. Our parliamentary commission will take care of this problem,"" Lavrov said.
[...] ""Ukraine now does not want to argue with the European states. In order to somehow help in this situation, it is necessary to call ambassadors, send diplomatic notes, organize protests. A scandal is needed, but Kiev cannot do anything now. In these conditions, out of desperation, parents turn to us"", says Aleksei Ispolinov, an expert in international law. He adds that Russia would have more possibilities to help if the children's parents applied for Russian citizenship [...].
For them, the embassies of Russia and Belarus are diplomatic representatives of countries that are not foreign to them, where everyone speaks their mother tongue.
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian refugees will apply for Russian citizenship to protect their children on EU territory.
Reality: Kiev deals with the problems of its citizens, who became war refugees, while Russia kidnapped and deported Ukrainian children
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there were a number of problems caused by the differences in legislation and the lack of documents of Ukrainian citizens. As a result, there was an interaction of specialized institutions from European states with refugee minors from Ukraine, but it is not about taking them by force.
According to the People's Advocate of Ukraine, Dmytro Lubinet, the Ukrainian authorities are aware of every situation that has arisen in European states regarding minors who have become war refugees. He told TSN that most of the problems arise as a result of legislative differences. ""In Ukraine, the grandmother is automatically considered the grandson's guardian, and in most European states, this is not the case. The European authorities have initiated various procedures. We intervened, we explained the situation"", mentioned the People's Advocate of Ukraine.
According to the official from Kiev, many children arrived in the EU without documents and even now they do not have passports. Being notified in advance to deal with this problem, many Ukrainians did nothing and now they are considered to be illegal in the EU territory. ""I recently talked with the ombudsmen of the Italian regions, I asked them to solve each case. I told them each child's name. All the announced situations have been resolved"", says Lubinet.
In this context, the problems of Ukrainian refugees in the EU are used by Russian propaganda to demonstrate that Ukraine is a state that does not care about its citizens. Moreover, according to the false narratives from Russia, Kiev does not want to argue with the European states and leaves the Ukrainian minors and their parents without any help. The involvement of Ukrainian diplomats in solving the problems of refugees is ignored by the Russian government media.
For these reasons, the experts cited in Russia predict an increase in requests to obtain Russian citizenship. The reader is left with the impression that the Ukrainian refugees are abandoned by their state and are desperately asking for help from Moscow or even Belarus. The statements about the desire of the Ukrainians to obtain the citizenship of the state that attacked them militarily and made them leave their country are only an assumption and are not based on evidence. Starting from a grain of truth regarding the situation of some Ukrainian minors in the EU, who do not have documents or who have arrived in foreign countries without parents, the Russian press comes to the conclusion that Ukraine does not help them because it does not want to upset the West, which is not this is true.
In addition, the false narrative is promoted in the Russian-speaking information space in order to absolve Russia. In April a.c. 49 UN and EU member states condemned Russia for abusing the rights and privileges of a permanent member of the Security Council to spread disinformation about the ""generalized abductions of thousands of Ukrainian children"". At the beginning of May, the OSCE published a report according to which a large number of Ukrainian children were deported to Russia and the territories occupied by it. The OSCE mentions that Russia violated the rights of Ukrainian children illegally taken to Russian territory, which could at some point be classified as crimes against humanity. 45 member countries requested an investigation into the deportations of Ukrainian children.
Veridica dismantled other false narratives from the Russian Federation regarding the situation of civilians in the context of the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Ukrainian children are sold to the West, and the losses of the Ukrainian army are so high that students are forced to donate blood for the military. The Russian press also wrote that only Russian speakers from the east are mobilized in the army because they want to exterminate them, and Kiev gives money to those who trick their friends into enlisting.

NEWS: The leadership of the Republic of Moldova is approaching direct complicity with Ukraine, following the leadership of the collective West, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zaharova, said on Wednesday.
""The West, with the hands of the Kiev regime, is actively drawing the Republic of Moldova into the conflict in Ukraine and even more sees it in the role of a second Ukraine. Unfortunately, Chisinau succumbs to these tricks and is no longer limited to discussions about the so-called unprovoked aggression of Moscow and calls for unlimited solidarity with the Kiev regime. The Moldovan authorities are getting closer and closer to the situation of becoming direct accomplices of the criminal power in Kiev, putting their own citizens at stake.
The representative of the Russian MFA drew attention to the statement regarding the readiness of Moldova to become a logistic hub for the southeastern territories of Ukraine, despite the bloodshed that is taking place. ""Any politician or civil servant with a clear mind would never want the country to become a bridgehead for military actions. However, we see that the Moldovan leadership is looking for it with a candle, invites, calls to its territory all kinds of troubles and misfortunes. I even propose to send engineers to demining the territories of Ukraine""
""At the same time, Moldova's cooperation with NATO and the EU in the political-military field is developing, the militarization of the country continues. In this context, the idea of ​​renouncing the neutrality status provided for in the Constitution is actively promoted, because it would not correspond to current international realities. Of course, this cannot fail to raise concern,"" said the representative of the Russian MAE.
NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European leadership from Chisinau intends to involve the Republic of Moldova in the war in Ukraine. 2. The government of the Republic of Moldova wants to impose the country's accession to NATO.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Chisinau government condemned the war and showed its support for the Ukrainians, primarily by hosting and ensuring the transit of more than 850,000 Ukrainian citizens, of which over 100,000 are still in the country. At the same time, Chisinau has repeatedly conveyed that it maintains its neutrality - established, moreover, by the Constitution - and will not get involved in the war.
However, Russian propaganda launched several narratives aimed at inoculating the idea that the authorities in Chisinau are servants of the West and ready to get involved in the war in Ukraine on the side of Kiev, even though they denied any intention to join the military operations and ruled out the settlement of the frozen conflict in Transnistria by military means.
Theses about the preparation of the Republic of Moldova for a war against Russia, its involvement in military conflicts, the use of infrastructure by NATO to support Ukraine in the war with Russia have intensified in the last period of time, the aim being to fuel the citizens' fears and negative attitude against NATO. The North Atlantic Alliance is a scarecrow for a good part of the population of the Republic of Moldova, who looks at it through the prism of Soviet propaganda and, more recently, of the Russian Federation. In this context, polls show that approximately 25-30% of the country's population would opt for joining NATO, the majority of the population opting for maintaining neutrality, even if the invasion of neutral Ukraine showed that this status is not a solution for ensuring security.
OBJECTIVE: To induce fear about the danger of the Republic of Moldova's involvement in a large-scale military conflict (against Russia) if it continues to approach the West (NATO) and, thus, to cause pressure on the authorities. To inoculate the idea that neutrality is the only security solution for the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Maria Zaharova's comment is most likely a reaction to the statements of the Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nicu Popescu, at the Conference on the Recovery of Ukraine, in London, from June 21-22. ""We will continue to contribute to the consolidation of the ""Solidarity Corridors"" initiative, including by implementing joint infrastructure projects to facilitate the transit of Ukrainian goods on the territory of the Republic of Moldova. We expressed the readiness of the Republic of Moldova to become a logistics hub for the southern territories east of Ukraine, thus contributing to the reconstruction process. Another initiative announced concerns the consolidation of the energy interconnection between Ukraine and the EU through the Republic of Moldova, including through the use of overhead power lines. At the same time, our country is prepared to send a group of engineers to participate in the demining efforts of the Ukrainian territory"", declared Nicu Popescu.
From the statements of the head of diplomacy in Chisinau, it is clear that he referred to infrastructure projects with Ukraine and the country's readiness to become a logistic hub for the reconstruction of Ukraine, which will normally bring opportunities to the Republic of Moldova as well - transit of goods, opportunities for jobs, technology, experience.
The purpose of the meeting in London was to ""mobilize international support for Ukraine for economic and social stabilization and recovery after the effects of the war""; military support for Ukraine was not discussed on this occasion.
The war caused by Russia in Ukraine fueled the discussions in Chisinau about the best solution to ensure security (as it happened in other states of the world), and several officials declared that neutrality does not provide this security, as demonstrated by and the Russian invasion from the neighboring country. However, officials from Chisinau, including the president Maia Sandu, have stated several times that the change of this statute can only be produced through a referendum.
Moreover, the Russian invasion caused discussions about the need to ensure security in much safer states with traditions of neutrality, such as Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Switzerland.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: Political elites from Chisinau discuss the possibility of the country joining NATO, but specify that this can only happen through a referendum.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: ""In relations with external partners, the authorities of the Republic of Moldova act based on the national interests of our country.
It is known that Moldovan-Russian relations are considerably affected, as a result of the launching by the Russian Federation of military aggression against Ukraine and all its negative consequences, including for the Republic of Moldova.
The Moldovan authorities remain determined to counteract the destabilizing actions of the Russian Federation directed against our country"", commented the MFA from Chisinau on Maria Zaharova's statements. Publication / Media:

In reality, the UN report blames Russia for the suffering of civilians.
Propaganda: Ukraine tortured civilians, according to a UN report
NEWS: ""Dozens of people held in secret Ukrainian prisons have been tortured, according to a report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the detention of civilians in Ukraine.
""Of the detainees interviewed who had a connection with the war, 43 (34 men and 9 women) credibly reported on torture and ill-treatment committed by law enforcement agencies, military personnel or guards in unofficial places of detention or , to a much lesser extent, in preventive detention centers"", the message says.
On September 23, 2022, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking about Ukraine at a meeting of the UN Security Council, said that Russia has a lot of evidence of the criminal actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ""More than 3,000 complaints about crimes against the people of Donbass were sent to the International Criminal Court, but they were ignored,"" said Sergey Lavrov. The Russian Foreign Minister also asked the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, to -use his authority and make Kiev publish a list of the names of all those who died in the Ukrainian city of Bucea, mentioning that it seems that only Russia is interested in this topic.
NARRATIVE: The UN accused Ukraine of torturing civilians.
Reality: Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine in the context of the large-scale invasion
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the report of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights ""Detention of civilians in the context of the armed attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine (February 24, 2022 - May 23, 2023)"" represents an analysis of the situation of civilians in detention in the period of the war Most of the cases of torture and other abuses described in the report do not refer to Ukraine, but to Russia.
The report accuses Russia of committing war crimes in a number of Ukrainian localities, but also mentions some ""insignificant violations of the law"" by representatives of Ukraine's law enforcement forces.
According to the report, ""91 percent of civilians in Russian custody reported torture, ill-treatment, including rape."" In other words, the report accuses Russia, not Ukraine, of mass torturing civilians. The UN expresses its concern in the connection with the execution by Russia of 77 civilians until May 23 BC. According to the report, access to Russian information and places of detention was only partial, which means that the crimes committed by Russia on the territory of Ukraine could be much more many than those known now.
The report notes that there are also cases of abuse committed by the Ukrainian military, but the UN experts mention Kiev's willingness to collaborate with the OHCHR. Ukraine is not accused of executing civilians, but of harsh behavior in some cases towards those who were suspected of committing crimes against the population during the occupation. Starting from this kernel of truth, the Russian government media wrote that only Ukraine was accused by the UN of torturing civilians, citing some past statements by Moscow officials.
The news was written by taking out of context some information convenient to Russian propaganda and citing the source incompletely in order to manipulate public opinion in order to justify Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the attitude of some international organizations towards the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that NATO supports Ukraine to cause a world war, while Russia and China want peace on the globe. According to Russian propaganda, the EU sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022 to weaken Russia, and the UN denounced the crimes committed by Ukrainian nationalists. Publication / Media:

NEWS: The PAS majority deputy, Vasile Soimaru proposed to fine colleagues who speak Russian. He launched this initiative on Friday, during the hearing of the report of the Council for Equality
""After 33 years since the declaration of sovereignty, a small part of this parliament discriminates against the independent state of the Republic of Moldova and the official language - Romanian. How long can we wait until this particle is with the other side? Do you have a mechanism somehow? I have an economic one"", Soimaru addressed the reporter, letting it be understood that ""it is necessary to apply fines against Russian speakers""
[...] The linguistic problem is painful in Moldova. In 1989, on the wave of perestroika, the population of Transnistria and Gagauzia demanded legislation, along with the Moldavian language of Russian as the second state language, which was spoken by almost 90% of the population and which was the main language for a third of population. The deputies refused and Russian was declared as the language of interethnic communication alongside Moldovan as the state language. These disputes led to a conflict in Gagauzia and to war in Transnistria and to the division of the country.
Disputes regarding the state language increased after PAS came to power, a significant part of which believes that Moldova must unite with Romania. On their initiative, the Parliament approved, on March 23, the change of the name of the state language to Romanian. It did not have votes for the amendment of the Constitution, so that it still states the name of the Moldovan language""
NARRATIVE: The pro-European government in Chisinau persecutes Russian speakers in the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the Republic of Moldova, during the former USSR, the Russian language was the language of the communist elites and minorities, especially Russians and Ukrainians; as in the Tsarist period until 1918, Russian was practically the language of the occupying power, having a higher status than the Romanian language, even if the latter has always been the language spoken by the majority of the population.
According to the legislation adopted at the end of the Soviet period, the Russian language was given the role of the language of interethnic communication. But the law was declared obsolete (obsolete) by the Constitutional Court. Meanwhile, the share of national minorities decreased, and according to the 2014 census, 82% of the population declared themselves Moldovan/Romanian (in 2004, 78% declared themselves Moldovan/Romanian), followed by Ukrainians - 6.6%, Gagauzians - 4 .6% and Russians - 4.4%.
Although the share of Russian-speaking minorities is decreasing, there are still politicians and parties that try to use minorities for electoral purposes, including by promoting topics such as the declaration of the Russian language as the second state language.
They were brought back to the fore after the Chisinau Parliament voted a law by which it excludes the phrase ""Moldovan language"" from the legislation and replaced it with ""Romanian language"". The legislature thus implemented a decision of the Constitutional Court from December 2013, which established that the text of the Declaration of Independence, which establishes the Romanian language as the state language, prevails over the text of the Constitution (voted in 1994 by a center-left parliament) in which the state language was called ""Moldovan"".
OBJECTIVE: To feed the phobias of national minorities regarding the fact that the pro-European government in Chisinau will undermine their rights. To maintain the pro-Russian and anti-Western views of the majority of representatives of national minorities.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The manipulation of TASS is visible from the headline of the news, taken over by several media institutions from Russia and the Republic of Moldova, including from the separatist region of Transnistria, where the subject is even more sensitive than in the area controlled by Chisinau. In fact, deputy Soimaru did not refer to all Russian speakers. The Russian press agency puts in quotation marks its own assumption that the deputy had in mind ""the need to apply fines against Russian speakers"", thus leaving the impression that it represents a quote from the deputy's statements, although he did not state this.
Vasile Soimaru showed himself really disturbed during the debates in the Parliament that some deputies do not know or do not speak the official language of the country - Romanian - and declared that he has a mechanism to stop this situation - an economic one. But he referred exclusively to deputies who, by law, are obliged to know Romanian.
The struggle of the majority population in the Republic of Moldova to return to the Latin script and the Romanian language from the late 80s - early 90s is qualified by Russian propaganda as one of the main reasons for the creation of the Transnistrian secessionist region. In reality, Transnistria - created, anyway, by the Soviets in the 20s to be a bridgehead for the capture of Bessarabia - allowed Moscow to keep a lever in the region after the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Moldova and the collapse of the USSR; Russia's involvement in the 1992 war is a clear proof that it was behind the separatists. Historians also consider that separatism was a reaction of the political and economic elites on the left of the Dniester, patrons of Moscow, in an attempt to maintain their status and privileges that they had created during the Soviet period. The American historian Charles King says, for example, that Transnistrian separatism ""was not a revolt of minorities, but of political and economic elites"".
It is also a lie that the name of the language was not changed in the Constitution. In fact, the Law voted by the parliament provides for the execution of the decision of the Constitutional Court from December 2013, which refers to the Romanian language as the state language. Accordingly, the name of the language was changed in the text of the Constitution.

NEWS: ""The trial against the Sor Party at the Constitutional Court was unconstitutional from the start, and the verdict - known from the very beginning"".
[...] ``I witnessed the arguments presented by the lawyers appointed illegally by the government, who dug out ""arguments"" from the files of the Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office and from the unfinished criminal case, which was not sent to court and on which there is no final verdict .
Declaring the Sor parliamentary party unconstitutional, CC and PAS ignored the sovereignty of that part of the electorate that voted for its representatives in the legislative body.
Yes, the legislation does not establish the procedure for deleting a parliamentary party during the mandates of deputies recognized by the Constitutional Court. Just as it does not establish cases of brazen disregard of the opinion of the sovereign people. As the procedure for declaring the unconstitutionality of a party is not established in the law on political parties. Moreover, there is no procedure to declare the unconstitutionality of a parliamentary party
Who is to blame? The government and the parliament together with the president did not ensure the fulfillment of the requirements of the respective law. It happened, definitely in coordination, not to mention the insistence of the governing party. The referral was submitted to the Constitutional Court by its Government. There is no doubt that it is a violation of the provision of the constitution that prohibits the usurpation of state power by a political party"". NARRATIVE: The Sor party was outlawed at the behest of the government and the decision of the Constitutional Court was a political one, based on arguments that are not valid.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On June 19, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova declared the Sor Party unconstitutional, following a notification filed in November 2022 by the Government. The Court came to the conclusion that the Sor Political Party ""militates against the principles of the rule of law, sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Moldova"".
In its notification, the Government referred to several violations of the law committed by the Sor Party in the electoral campaigns that led to the exclusion of its candidates from the elections, the accusations of illegal financing of the party, including from external sources, but also the inclusion of the party and its leader or, the fugitive politician Ilan Sor on the American government's sanctions list, based on the Magnitki Act. ""This represents, through its actions, a threat to the existence or sovereignty of the state, to the democratic order within it,"" states the government, which says that unconstitutionality can also be proclaimed in ""cases when political parties essentially represent criminal associations or use as instruments of political struggle and promotion of one's own agenda of secret or subversive methods"".
On October 26, the US Treasury included the Sor Party and its leader in the list of sanctions, arguing that they tried to divert the European course of the Republic of Moldova and bring it back into the sphere of influence of Russia, collaborating in this sense with individuals from the Russian Federation.
Ilan Sor is an oligarch who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his involvement in a major bank robbery in 2014. In 2016, the oligarch entered politics and founded the Sor Party based on a pro-Russian political formation. He was mayor of Orhei and deputy from 2019 until recently, when his mandate was revoked after he was convicted. In 2019, he fled to Israel, whose citizenship he holds. Since 2022, Sor's formation has organized several anti-government protests which, according to the American authorities, were aimed at establishing a regime favorable to Moscow.
OBJECTIVE: To present the pro-European government from Chisinau as a dictatorial one and thus reduce the number of supporters of European integration. To present the Sor Party as a political victim, thereby favoring the growth of the image of its leaders.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: Before ruling, the Constitutional Court also requested an opinion from the Venice Commission regarding the Government's approach from last November. The Venice Commission noted that a decision regarding the declaration of the unconstitutionality of a political party may represent an interference with the right to free association, therefore the decision must be based on legality, legitimacy and necessity. In the same document, the Commission specifies that it is within the powers of the Constitutional Court to rule on this subject.
In the reasoning presented by the Constitutional Court shortly after the pronouncement of the decision, the institution presents the arguments it took into account. This reminds of the multiple cases in which the Sor Party violated the legislation regarding the financing of political parties; the practice continued even after the authorities decided on sanctions and in spite of some final decisions of the courts, which shows the systemic nature of the violation of the law. The sanctions imposed by the EU, the United States and Norway on the Sor Party are mentioned in context, as well as documents issued by the Chisinau authorities, including the Information and Security Service, which show the involvement of a foreign state (it is Russia, which is not explicitly mentioned in the decision) in the financing of this political formation.
The Constitutional Court also recorded the opinion of the Venice Commission according to which ""the general situation in the country is an important factor in evaluating the use by a party of inappropriate or even illegal means to distract voters from other parties or even the use of resources to undermine the correctness or integrity of the political competition, leading to distortions of the electoral process, through the unfairly obtained advantage, supported by unauthorized foreign financing"" and appreciated that the organization of protests aimed at overthrowing the government and the financing coming from outside have intensified after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, in the conditions in which the conflict also affects the security of the Republic of Moldova. In addition, the Court ""noted that the party's objective to overthrow the democratic order can be deduced from the cases of non-transparent financing, from the protests organized and non-transparently paid for by party and from the claims of party representatives and even of Mr. Ilan Sor exposed during these meetings.""
A number of experts from Chisinau considered the Court's decision to be justified and reasoned.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The decision of June 19 is a first for the Republic of Moldova and, indeed, there is no legal framework that accurately provides for the procedures that follow after the declaration of the unconstitutionality of a political party, but the Court's decision provides that they will be dealt with a commission created by the Ministry of Justice.

Propaganda: The Sea of ​​Azov belongs only to Russia after the accession of some Ukrainian regions to the Russian Federation and the withdrawal of Ukraine from a bilateral agreement
NEWS: ""The Council of the Federation approved the termination of the agreement with Ukraine regarding the common use of the Sea of ​​Azov and the Kerch Strait. In this sense, the Sea of ​​Azov has become an internal sea of ​​Russia.
In the explanatory note of the meeting of the Federation Council, it is said that after the annexation of the People's Republic of Donetsk, the regions of Zaporozhye and Kherson to Russia, the Sea of ​​Azov became an internal sea of ​​Russia, and Ukraine lost its status as a country with access to the coast.
""Ukraine has unilaterally withdrawn from the treaty [...]"", the document states. The Russian army succeeded in the special military operation to take control of all exits to the Sea of ​​Azov.
[...] Of course, thanks to the successful actions of the Russian army to turn the Sea of ​​Azov into an internal sea of ​​the Russian Federation, Ukrainian plans to locate foreign military bases in this area have become impossible. If this initiative became a reality, there would be an obvious danger for our country.""
NARRATIVE: The Sea of ​​Azov became an internal sea of ​​Russia in order not to allow the placement of foreign military bases.
Reality: Ukraine has not given up its territories that open to the Sea of ​​Azov and wants to recover them from Russia
Why the narrative is false: The annexation of some Ukrainian regions to Russia following recent referendums was not recognized by Ukraine and most of the world's states. The international community condemned both the war started by Russia against Ukraine, as well as the annexation of the regions of Kherson, Zaporozhye, Donetsk and Luhansk, partially captured by Russian forces. Also, the annexation of Crimea has been condemned countless times. The illegal occupation of these Ukrainian territories cannot be a legal basis for considering the Sea of ​​Azov an internal sea.
In order to demonstrate to public opinion that Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is a success, the pro-Kremlin press writes that the Sea of ​​Azov has legally become an internal sea in the context of Ukraine's unilateral withdrawal from a bilateral treaty with Russia , signed in 2003. On December 19, 2022, the Kyiv Parliament denounced the cooperation agreement with Russia in the Sea of ​​Azov, arguing that Moscow violated the norms of international law and annexed some Ukrainian regions by military means. The Russian press presented the denunciation of this agreement as a recognition by Kiev of Russia's right to use the Sea of ​​Azov as an internal sea.
In reality, the denunciation of the agreement was motivated in Kiev by the transformation of Russia into an enemy state, which has militarized the Black and Azov Seas and which must liberate all the occupied Ukrainian localities. The Kyiv parliament did not recognize Russia's territorial annexations and launched a necessary legal mechanism in the context of the future liberation of the regions occupied by Moscow.
After the annexation of Crimea, Russia limited the access of Ukrainian ships to the Sea of ​​Azov, despite the fact that, according to international norms, 2/3 of the waters should be under Kiev's control. In 2016, Ukraine sued Russia at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, requesting the restoration of its access to the Sea of ​​Azov.
The information in the Russian press about the blocking of the process of locating foreign military bases in the Sea of ​​Azov is another invention of pro-Kremlin propaganda. The issue of locating such bases in the Sea of ​​Azov has never been raised. In addition, in order to block such an initiative, if it had appeared at a given moment, it was not necessary to occupy other Ukrainian territories because Russia controlled the Kerch Strait. At the same time, the advisors of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have repeatedly stated that Ukraine aims to recover Crimea this year in order to restore the historical and political truth.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about Russia's successes in the war in Ukraine. The pro-Kremlin press wrote that a civil war is taking place in Ukraine for the restoration of Great Russia, while the ""special military operation"" is saving Russia from Western aggression. According to Russian propaganda, Moscow must mobilize to defeat NATO in the new, ""war for the defense of the homeland"". Also, the Russian press claims that Putin warned Ukraine 23 years ago that NATO would cause a war. Publication / Media:

Food only for the chosen ones
NEWS: ""Supermarkets in Great Britain have started to implement a new digital passport system that denies ordinary citizens the opportunity to buy food if they are blacklisted for non-compliance. According to images posted on Twitter this week, the Aldi supermarket chain has started denying access to people who do not have a digital passport on their phone. In the viral video, a man behind the camera showed viewers the barriers that block access to the shopping area for those who do not have a passport. [...] Also, Amazon and other companies have recently launched similar stores in several countries.""
NARRATIVE: People who do not obey the digital dictatorship will be eliminated by denying access to food.
CONTEXT: With the accelerated development of technology, more and more aspects of daily life are subject to transformations, in the sense of digitization and automation of operational processes. The goals of these changes differ from case to case and have in mind the efficiency of activities, the reduction of execution times, or even the elimination of bureaucratic aspects and errors generated by the human factor. Such a transformation is being tested these days by a chain of consumer goods stores in England, an opportunity for conspiracy theorists to once again accuse the preparation of digital camps where people will be imprisoned in the near future.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the authorities and the entire political class, promoting the sovereignist discourse, provoking and amplifying social tensions.
In a highly competitive market, there will always be alternatives
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In general, the digitization of activities is carried out with the help of applications installed on the electronic devices that almost every citizen owns, whether we are talking about computers, mobile phones or smart watches, etc. In the case of the test in the London store under discussion, we are dealing with such an application, and in no case can we talk about a ""digital passport"". Thus, access to the store is based on a QR code generated by it application, and the customer's entire shopping experience is subsequently automated. He does not have to pay when leaving the store, because smart cameras track the items he buys, calculate the total cost of the products and automatically withdraw the corresponding amount from the user's bank account, previously introduced in the application. It is obvious that a non-user of the respective application will not be able to benefit from this service, and the fact that in this way he is denied access to shopping can only be attributed to the store through the lens of a faulty management of the portfolio of potential customers. It is also worth noting that the shopping experience 100% independent of the interaction with a human operator has been implemented by the same chain of stores since July 2022 in the Netherlands, but that information escaped the attention of domestic conspiracists at that time. The entire system for scanning customers and the products they buy, functional for almost a year in the European Union, is designed to protect the identities and confidentiality of buyers, in accordance with the strictest European data protection regulations. In any case, the success of this technological approach ultimately depends on the degree of acceptance by consumers. The sales strategy of a store that is permanently empty, or with insufficient revenue to cover maintenance expenses, will definitely be rethought, in an extremely competitive market, with an increasingly informed public and unwilling to extreme compromises when it comes it's about his basic needs.

15,517,The Romanians understood that they should not support Ukraine,Bucharest must not support Ukraine in the war because its borders are not recognized,False,[],"['Romanians', 'Ukraine']",,,,,,,https://argumenti.ru/politics/2023/06/838089,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-romanii-au-inteles-ca-nu-trebuie-sa-sprijine-ucraina,,19.06.2023,,Romania,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-romanii-au-inteles-ca-nu-trebuie-sa-sprijine-ucraina,,"Romania should not support Ukraine because its borders are not recognized, according to Senator Diana Sosoaca. The false narrative was widely distributed by the Russian press.
Propaganda: The war in Ukraine is caused by a series of foreign interests, therefore Bucharest must not get involved
NEWS: ""Senator from Romania Diana Sosoaca declared that Ukraine is non-existent from a legal point of view because its borders are not recognized by the UN and it has no agreements with its neighbors. The parliamentarian mentioned that Ukraine has problems with Russia, but Bucharest should not get involved in this conflict"", according to the Argumenti publication, which recalls that the ""special military operation"" launched by Russia is being carried out successfully.
""Why should we be put in the middle of American interests, NATO interests and take bombs to my head, send my child to the front in Ukraine"", Diana Sosoaca is quoted by the Telegram channel ""Russia now"" , mentioning an awakening of public opinion in Romania.
""The state that has unrecognized borders does not exist from a legal point of view"", writes Livejournal, mentioning that this point of view was expressed by the representative of the Romanian Senate, who in the past requested the annexation of some territories by Bucharest from the Ukrainian component.
NARRATIVE: Bucharest should not support Ukraine in the war because its borders are not recognized.
Reality: Ukraine's borders have been recognized internationally, including by Russia, which, in addition, has guaranteed them
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In order to justify the war started by Moscow against the Ukrainian state, the Russian government media and Telegram channels from Moscow translated a fragment of the conversation between Senator Diana Sosoaca and journalist Luis Lazarus, in which the parliamentarian argues that Ukraine should not be supported from Romania. Diana Sosoaca's statement was quoted by one of the most read Telegram channels in the post-Soviet space, ""Russia now"" (1.6 million subscribers), being picked up by Russian media and the Ukrainian regions occupied by the Russian army. The statement is presented as an awakening of public opinion in Romania, a correct and appropriate point of view. The Russian press recalls that Diana Sosoaca officially requested the annexation of territories inhabited by Romanian-speaking communities in Ukraine in the context of discussions about the successful implementation of the ""special military operation "".
In reality, at the time of the outbreak of the war in Donbass and the annexation of Crimea, Ukraine had border recognition agreements with all its neighbors, including Romania and Russia. At the same time, Diana Sosoaca does not represent the point of view of the Romanian Parliament or the Romanian society, as the Russian press claims.
Through a Russian-Ukrainian agreement of 2003, Moscow recognized the state borders of Ukraine, and Kiev - of Russia. According to the agreement, Russia recognized Crimea as Ukrainian territory. Moreover, through the Budapest Memorandum, Russia offered Ukraine security guarantees in exchange for giving up the nuclear arsenal inherited from the USSR. Also, the Kremlin has committed itself to never attack Ukraine through the agreements regarding the deployment of the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. All these international agreements were violated by Russia, starting with the annexation of Crimea and ending with the large-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The statement regarding the non-recognition of Ukraine's borders by the UN is also false. In 2014, the UN General Assembly expressed its support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine. In 2022, 143 UN states condemned the aggression of the Russian Federation and spoke for the territorial integrity of Ukraine based on the UN Charter. The war in Ukraine is a military aggression by Moscow, and Ukraine has an inherent right to defend itself. In this context, according to international law, Romania or any other state can support Kiev's right to defend itself against armed aggression.
The Russian press quotes Diana Sosoaca quite often, presenting her position as a dominant one in Romanian society. In April, the Russian press wrote that the senator's speeches are very brave and fair because they show concrete evidence that Ukraine is a terrorist state. The Russian press also wrote that Diana Sosoaca opposes the pro-Western policy of Bucharest which helps the ""regime in Kiev"". At the same time, the publication ""Vzglead"" called Diana Sosoaca a fascist senator, but who shows to be friendly with Moscow. At the same time, the publication EurAsia Daily called Diana Sosoaca a dedicated anti-NATO fighter who tells the truth.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives launched by Senator Diana Sosoaca in the Romanian information space. In April a.c. Diana Sosoaca declared that the future Polish-Ukrainian state will dismember Romania. In March, the senator submitted to Parliament a law that provides for the annexation of territories belonging to Ukraine. At the beginning of this year, Diana Sosoaca said that Western occult forces will take the children of Romanian families. Publication / Media:

16,518,The fear of artificial intelligence will intensify the dictatorship,the globalist elite is preparing new restrictive measures to enslave the population,False,[],[],,,,,,,https://www.activenews.ro/opinii/Dupa-COVID-apare-o-noua-Sperietoare-Inteligenta-Artificiala-182643,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-teama-de-inteligenta-artificiala-va-intensifica-dictatura,,16.06.2023,,Romania,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-teama-de-inteligenta-artificiala-va-intensifica-dictatura,,"The global dictatorship will tighten by inducing and exploiting the fear of Artificial Intelligence, according to a false narrative in the Romanian media space.
Artificial intelligence is dangerous, but the occult says this only to control humanity
NEWS: According to the already familiar model, launched in the fight to ""fight fake news"", accredited teams of ""fact-checkers"", specialized in AI, will appear to verify, judge and decide the authenticity of various posts on the Internet. Obviously, under the pretext of defending Democracy and combating external attacks by hostile dictatorships, which seek to destabilize the West. Well, the ""factcheckers"" will be able to establish that, while Trump's kiss with Fauci is authentic, the thousands of pictures of Hunter Biden having sex with minors are artificial intelligence and disinformation of Russia or China. No one will be able to protest. No one will be able to challenge their decision. The (justified) fears of AI will be used not to combat abuses, but to intensify the Dictatorship. The scenario is well known: a danger is created, the population is frightened, after which the ""authorities "" the savior intervenes. Under the pretext of the State of Emergency, the ""Truth"" is once again left at the mercy of the ""experts"". The fist that was thrust into our mouths three years ago sinks even deeper down the throat.
NARRATIVES: 1. Under the pretext of protecting the population from artificial intelligence, the globalist elites will implement new restrictive measures. 2. Artificial intelligence represents a danger to humanity, possibly even leading to its extermination.
BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of some devices to correctly interpret external data, learn from it and use what they have learned to achieve their goals. AI began to be researched and developed in the mid-50s of the last century, reaching the end of the 90s to be used in various fields such as logistics, statistics, economics, mathematics or even medical diagnosis. At the same time, important steps were also taken in sports and entertainment such that, in 1997, Deep Blue, a computer dedicated exclusively to the game of chess, built by IBM, defeated world champion Garry Kasparov, and in 2011, in a demo editions of a show-competition of general culture, Watson, a question-answering system also built by IBM, easily defeated the two biggest champions in the show's history. Little by little, AI has become more and more present in everyday life, from ""personal assistants"" in smart phones, to systems for personalizing the online experience of users, generating an increasingly acute need to regulate the use of this type With the launch, at the end of last year, of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence application that imitates human language, there was also a current that claims that AI is as dangerous as pandemics and nuclear war, and several experts from IT have signed an open letter by which they urged to stop the development of the next generation of AI.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the anti-Western sovereignist discourse, diminishing the population's trust in the authorities, provoking and amplifying social tensions.
The AI ​​Act restricts AI, not humans
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The European Parliament is the first legislative body in the world to adopt a law on artificial intelligence, but in no case does this fact imply the establishment of restrictive measures on the population. The legislation, applicable exclusively to this technology, will guarantee that the AI ​​developed and used in Europe ""fully respects the rights and values ​​of the European Union, including human surveillance, safety, privacy, transparency, non-discrimination and social and environmental well-being"". Having an approach based on the ranking of the potential risks of the use of AI, the legislation will prohibit, for example, contrary to the alarmist predictions of conspiracy theorists, systems that classify people based on social behavior or personal characteristics. ""truth, AI systems like ChatGPT will have to disclose when a content has been generated by AI, including to help distinguish ""deep fake"" images from real ones and introduce safeguards against the generation of illegal content. At the same time, providers of general purpose artificial intelligence systems will have to assess and mitigate possible risks to health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment, democracy and the rule of law and register their models in the Union's database before launching them on the European market. The accusations of ""free speech fighters"" of censorship caused by AI are nonsense, given that conspiracy theories or Russian propaganda related to the invasion of Ukraine are going viral exponentially. In fact, the conspiracists' fear seems to be related rather to the speed with which the narratives false ones will be unmasked, except by an actual censorship.
Regarding the dangers that beset humanity with the accelerated development of AI systems, several specialists claim that the apocalyptic warnings are exaggerated. In their opinion, the fears are unrealistic and represent a distraction from other, more practical and immediate-effect problems, such as homework done by students with the help of AI, the generation of falsified audio-video productions, or the exploitation of people's online behavior for commercial purposes. The risk of artificial intelligence using, for example, drug discovery tools to build chemical weapons exists, but in the last instance, this would only be a theoretical approach, for its implementation human intervention is necessary. In the same way, the creation and spreading of disinformation and fake news by AI is possible, but for them to have an effect, the human factor is needed again, to accept them and act according to them. AI programs are, in essence, tools made to be used by humans. Publication / Media:

Propaganda: The conflict in Ukraine is a civil war, in which Russia has a historical right to participate
NEWS: ""What is happening now in Ukraine is the result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is a delayed civil war. In other circumstances, it should have started back in 1991-1992, because huge imperial formations like the Soviet Union never disintegrate in peace and quiet. Because the blame for the collapse of the country was on the conscience of the Russian leaders, they could not immediately start a war to preserve the unity of the state from which they themselves left first. And they had no moral reason or any other reason to defend the country they decided to destroy.
[...]
Ukraine does not exist as a state. There is an army of mercenaries fighting for the interests of the United States. The Kiev regime does not pay salaries to its residents, does not have its own weapons. Ukraine lives only on what is given to it. The Kiev regime is ready to fight to the last Ukrainian in the interest of its patron - the United States.
[...]
If the Kiev regime has lost its mind and is not sorry for killing its own people, then nobody can do anything. Serious American politicians and analysts know that Ukraine will never defeat the Russian Federation. This can only be a big state. Otherwise, it will no longer exist. Nothing else is given to us. It is our destiny"".
NARRATIVES: 1. A civil war is taking place in Ukraine for the restoration of Great Russia, therefore Russia has the historical right to participate in it. 2. Ukraine is an artificial state. 3. The Ukrainian people do not exist. 4. Ukrainians are cannon fodder in a war of the West against Russia.
Reality: the war in Ukraine is not a civil conflict but a classic war of imperial aggression of one state against another state
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The article published by RIA Novosti is an attempt to absolve Russia and justify the military aggression against Ukraine, the war being called a ""delayed"" civil conflict. According to this false narrative, Moscow has the historical right to intervene militarily on the territory Ukraine because it did not do it during the breakup of the USSR.
In reality, the war in Ukraine is not a civil war, but a war of aggression launched by Russia against a sovereign state, which was recognized as such by Russia itself. Russia and Ukraine are two independent states, which have pledged to respect each other's inviolability of borders and territorial integrity. Moreover, through the Budapest Memorandum, Russia offered Ukraine security guarantees in exchange for giving up the nuclear arsenal inherited from the USSR. Also, the Kremlin has committed itself to never attack Ukraine through the agreements regarding the deployment of the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. All these international agreements were violated by Russia, starting with the annexation of Crimea and ending with the large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The international community reacted to this inter-state aggression including through the UN General Assembly, which adopted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian authorities are accused by the Russian media of destroying their own people and have become totally dependent on the West. In reality, the victims and destruction are caused by the Russian attack and the constant bombing of the localities and the civil infrastructure. The destruction caused by the Russian bombing exceeded 144 billion dollars a year after the war. The losses of society, of the Ukrainian political and economic elite following the war are enormous. The economic potential of the state is less and less. Large factories, refineries, enterprises were destroyed or seriously affected, a number of economic fields stopped their activity. All this is not the fault of the politicians from Kiev, but is a direct consequence of the invasion.
Other theses of the Russian propaganda resumed are those regarding the non-existence of a Ukrainian people with an identity distinct from the Russian one and the artificial nature of the Ukrainian state; the latter is also promoted in countries like Poland and Romania, encouraged to reclaim their historical territories that are part of today's Ukraine (but captured by and inherited from the USSR and/or tsarist Russia) precisely so that Russia can claim, in turn or, Ukrainian territories.
Also, the thesis of the West's interference in Ukraine, of the ""war waged by the West until the last Ukrainian"" is resumed. In fact, the Western states support Ukraine's right to defend its own territory and offer it political and economic support as well as weapons. ; this does not contravene international law, since in order to defend itself a state needs weapons that it can procure from wherever it deems. Moscow's speech has several objectives. First of all, it tries to justify the repeated failures recorded by its forces in the field saying that it is actually confronting the collective West, not Ukraine. Second, repeatedly stating that it is actually fighting the West (and suggesting that this confrontation could even turn into a world war /nuclear) Russia seeks to undermine its support by intimidating the leaders and scaring the population. Finally, this type of speech has the dual role of mobilizing the Russians by telling them that they are in an existential confrontation and undermining the morale of the Ukrainians by convincing - that they are not fighting for their country but for foreign interests.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that the war in Ukraine is in Zelensky's interest and is a civil conflict because Russians and Ukrainians are one people. According to Russian propaganda, Ukraine is a terrorist state and must be punished by Russia. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press demonstrates that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians would not - I support the Nazi leaders from Kiev. Publication / Media:

The West, a Bau-Bau, Russia, a fair international partner
NEWS: The West wants to see Moldova in the role of a second Ukraine, and the current government in Chisinau is playing this role, declared the Russian deputy foreign minister, Mihail Galuzin.
""In an absolutely irresponsible and narrow way, the West sees Moldova in the role of a second Ukraine and, unfortunately, the current government in Chisinau plays this role and actively participates,"" he told Russia-24
In addition, according to Galuzin, there is no escalation or tension with the people of Moldova and there can be no such thing. ""These are not our methods. We don't get involved in someone's internal affairs"", stressed the diplomat
The Russian deputy foreign minister mentioned that the overwhelming majority of Moldovan citizens oppose the marginal and hostile policy towards Russia, which their government promotes. ""It remains only to bet on the fact that the authorities in Chisinau will examine the reality coldly and will not follow the policy of worsening relations with Russia in favor of the West, which promotes an anti-Russian policy, but on the path of a healthy and pragmatic collaboration with our state, to which Moldova is linked by secular relations and strong economic relations"", concluded Galuzin.
NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European government in Chisinau promotes an anti-Russian policy at the behest of the West. 2. Unlike the West, Russia does not interfere in the internal affairs of its partners. 3. The Republic of Moldova is dependent on trade relations with Russia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova, which has oscillated between East and West during the more than 30 years of independence, is governed starting from 2021 by pro-European forces, led by President Maia Sandu and the Action and Solidarity Party. The government in Chisinau condemned the Russian invasion in Ukraine and partially aligned, even if unofficially, with a large part of the sanctions imposed by the international community on the aggressor state, which affected Chisinau-Moscow relations.
The Russian authorities launched more or less veiled criticisms and threats towards Chisinau, which officially claims that it wants to maintain correct relations with the Russian Federation.
One of the biggest differences between the two states concerns the separatist region in the east of the Republic of Moldova, supported de facto by Russia, which maintains troops on the left of the Dniester which it refuses to withdraw despite Chisinau's requests.
Since the beginning of the war, Russian propaganda has launched several narratives intended to inoculate the idea that the authorities in Chisinau are servants of the West and ready to get involved in the war in Ukraine on the side of Kiev, even if they have denied any intention to join the military operations, including with the aim of taking control of the Transnistrian region.
OBJECTIVE: To justify the invasion of Ukraine by presenting the West as a force that promotes the anti-Russian policy that it also imposes on the states in the region. To present Russia as a fair international partner, which respects the sovereignty, independence and decisions of other states.
Evidence of Russia's involvement in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Russian propaganda has been talking since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine about the intention of Kiev and the West to get Chisinau to get involved in the war, a thesis that has proven to be false. Chisinau rejected any participation in military actions, including some that would aim to take control of the Transnistrian region and remove Russian forces from the region, as Kiev had suggested. In addition, the Republic of Moldova with its insignificant military capabilities would not bring any relevant contribution to Ukraine's war effort, so that the West or Kiev would be interested in involving it in military operations.
Russia's involvement in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova was clear enough to determine the United States to impose, in October 2022, sanctions on some persons and entities from the two countries. The list includes the fugitive oligarch/politician Ilan Sor, sentenced to 15 years in prison for participating in the large-scale bank robbery of 2014, Russian businessmen and political strategists affiliated with some Moldovan politicians, including the former president, Igor Dodon. They would have tried to keep the Republic of Moldova in the sphere of Russian influence, getting involved in the 2021 parliamentary elections, and a year later, organizing protests aimed at overthrowing the pro-European government. At the end of May, the USA imposed sanctions on the names of seven other political strategists, connected to the Russian secret services who allegedly recently tried to destabilize the situation in the Republic of Moldova. Likewise, the European Union, but also separate states, such as Norway, Great Britain and Canada, have adopted sanctions.
Starting in 2020, RISE Moldova published a series of investigations that demonstrated Igor Dodon's strong connections with representatives of the Russian services, from whom he also received money. The last of the series of articles, published in March 2023, refers to the document that the international press also wrote about, regarding a Russian plan to bring the Republic of Moldova under its umbrella by 2030.
Moscow also used economic levers to keep the Republic of Moldova in its sphere of influence and prevent its approach to the European Union, including imposing embargoes. However, the economic sanctions turned against Russia, given that the Moldovan producers directed their exports to other markets, especially the EU. Russia's share in Moldovan exports has dropped from over 60% in the early 2000s, to slightly more than 4% in 2022. Russia has also lost its monopoly on gas deliveries, thus dismantling yet another false propaganda narrative about the irreplaceable role of the Russian market for the trade of the Republic of Moldova.

From monkey to man and back
NEWS: ""It is desired that the future will bring the involution of man. Citizens will be able to receive a guaranteed minimum income that will ensure their food and needs, i.e. what is strictly necessary. An alarming number of people seem to be delighted by this news, daydreaming of the day when they will be paid to sit on the couch watching TV. This system is already being tested in Great Britain and in the Nordic countries. A similar model, that of working from home, appeared during the pandemic, with a series of advantages that attracted citizens who decided to change their lifestyle and work. This is how the transhumanist mechanism of subjugating the citizens, disappearing social contact, has already been set in motion. Now we are moving towards the implementation of the guaranteed minimum income, a step correlated with the 15-minute cities which are nothing more than another manufactured lockdown, but which people must perceive as natural.""
NARRATIVE: In the near future, people will be isolated from the community, having their basic needs met through unconditional universal income.
CONTEXT: The idea of ​​distributing a part of the budget revenues to all citizens of a state, only on the basis of citizenship and without the obligation to prove the need for such financial aid, is a global phenomenon, with different approaches from country to country. In principle, regardless of the individual's financial status, the state guarantees him a basic income, so that he can get rid of food and housing forever. Although it has a strong utopian component, the idea has become more and more interesting in the context of increasingly obvious social gaps, caused by the crises that the planet has been going through for several years (the Covid19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the meteorological phenomena caused by the changes climatic etc.). With the intensification of the debates on the universal basic income and in the context of the more frequent attempts to implement the concept in various countries, there have also been voices that see in this solution a hidden purpose, that of subjugating the population more easily and locking them up in camps digital, also limiting his freedom of movement. The theme represents a link between the conspiracy theories that claim that, in the end, the sanitary or the ecological dictatorship will enslave humanity.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the authorities and the entire political class, demonizing the West, promoting the sovereignist discourse, provoking and amplifying social tensions.
Romanian patriots and the news of the last century
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The alarm signals about the universal basic income raised by domestic conspiracists can easily be classified as ""prophecies about the past"". Various forms of unconditional social income have been offered to the population since the 70s of the century past in regions of Canada and the American state of Alaska or, more recently, in economically underdeveloped areas in Africa and Asia, but also in economically strong countries such as Finland, the Netherlands or Israel. Depending on the results recorded, the projects have were continued, modified or abandoned, without the population of the respective communities being forced to certain social behaviors. Thus, in India it was found that granting a basic income increased the rate of education among young people by 25%. Instead, In Finland, there were no significant changes, which led to the program being abandoned after almost two years.In one region of Namibia, a basic income was distributed for two years, starting on January 1, 2008. , to each registered person. As a result, the total income of the region's residents increased by 29%, and crime, school absenteeism and unemployment decreased. At the same time, there was an increase in the number of newly established businesses in the area. In Israel, an economic framework is being developed to provide sustainable and scalable universal basic income through blockchain technology. Practically, Israel will create a peer-to-peer currency transfer network in which money can be distributed to the most needy, regardless of their location, based on the principles of unconditional basic income. Examples of such programs can be found in Wales, Kenya, Germany, Iraq, or Kuwait, but also in England, where such a pilot program will be tested, in which 30 people will receive a lump sum without conditions every month for two years. Also in England was implemented, in 2003, a measure recently adopted by the Romanian legislation in the form of the Junior Centenary Individual Savings Account, offering each child an ""own capital"" at the age of 18.
Regardless of the form adopted, granting such financial incentives has obvious advantages, from increasing the well-being of citizens, reducing poverty and lower economic inequalities, to better working conditions, wider redistribution of wealth, and even reducing gender gaps. But perhaps most importantly, a universal basic income would have the opposite effect to that proclaimed by the conspiracy theorists, in the sense that a citizen who is not burdened by the worry of tomorrow, has an increased freedom to fine the intrusive or harmful actions of the state, precisely because that income is unconditional.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: Without taking the discussion into the conspiracy zone, there are numerous economists who claim that the large-scale implementation of such programs can lead to an increase in public debt, high inflation and, in some cases, to the discouragement of work. Publication / Media:

All this catalogs standard security measures as signs of dictatorship.
NEWS: ""In Bulboaca, all the residents were sent under house arrest for two days, and in the locality close to Mimi, Chetrosu, not only the people were persecuted, but also the townspeople. He was forbidden to go out on the street.
[...] To take the leaders of the states to Kiev, where many of them have already been, was considered dangerous. Instead, Moldova, which has long been prepared to do anything anti-Russian, was only good [to host the summit]. Sandu immediately forgot about his country's European aspirations.
[...] The Moldovan deputy Bogdan Tirdea believes that ""the purpose and philosophy of the CPE summit in Bulboaca was to create an extended anti-Russian alliance.""
Similar concerns were expressed at the FSB. They believe that the West is pushing Moldova to get involved in the Ukrainian conflict. The spokesman of the Russian presidency promised that the Kremlin will carefully follow the news from Chisinau and the rhetoric that will dominate there.
[...] Today, Chisinau reminded of a ghost town from the movies. The city center was surrounded, public transport did not run. On the streets there were only policemen with guns and girls in white blouses, who turned out to be collaborators of the special services.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The summit of the European Political Community had a strong anti-Russian character, and the Republic of Moldova was drawn into this ""coalition"". 2. In the Republic of Moldova, an authoritarian police regime is being established, led by President Maia Sandu.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On June 1, the Republic of Moldova hosted the second Summit of the European Political Community, which brought together almost 50 European leaders. It was the first time that Chisinau organized an international event of such scope.
""The EPC Summit is an exceptional platform that offers small and large countries, both inside and outside the EU, an equal voice during the discussions. This makes it an unparalleled forum"", declared the President of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu. For Moldova, it was also an opportunity to promote its Europeanness and European integration aspirations.
The European political community was created in 2022, at the initiative of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The CPE aims to promote political dialogue and cooperation in order to address issues of common interest, as well as to strengthen the security, stability and prosperity of the European continent.
OBJECTIVE: To present the European states, especially the EU and NATO members, as making plans to attack Russia and to attract the Republic of Moldova to this ""coalition"". To present the government from Chisinau as a dictatorial regime, docile to the West.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The statement about the ""house arrest"" of the residents of Bulboaca is at least an exaggeration, and the spokesperson of the Government, Daniel Voda qualifies as ""fake news"" the rumors about the restrictions during the summit.
The description of the security measures in the center of Chisinau is greatly exaggerated. From May 31 to June 2, there were indeed restrictions and areas blocked for traffic (such measures are standard for events of this magnitude, regardless of where they take place) but, in general, pedestrians were able to move free and public transport circulated, even if some routes were changed.
The head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, declared that the summit was not organized against Russia, which, however, was not invited because of the war launched by Vladimir Putin against Ukraine.
The discussions of the second EPC Summit focused on three main topics: common efforts for peace and security; energy resilience and climate action; interconnections in Europe for a better connected and more stable continent.
The CPE does not replace any existing organization, structure or process and does not seek to create new ones at this stage, and no decision was adopted at the summit.
The involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the war in Ukraine against Russia is one of the most frequent false narratives promoted by Russian propaganda, which aims, on the one hand, to inoculate the idea that Russia is fighting against a large coalition of states, led by NATO, and on the other on the other hand, to incriminate the pro-European government from Chisinau as having bellicose tendencies. As part of the scenario described by Russian propaganda, there is also an attack by the Ukrainian army on the separatist region of Transnistria, with the agreement or participation of the Republic of Moldova. The authorities from Chisinau have repeatedly stated that the Republic of Moldova only considers the peaceful settlement of the Transnistrian conflict.
The European path of the Republic of Moldova was one of the main topics addressed by Maia Sandu during the bilateral meetings she had during the summit, a fact that also emerges from her speech at the end of the meeting. Later, Maia Sandu announced that the Republic of Moldova obtained support, financial assistance and more visibility in the international arena due to the hosting of the Summit of the European Political Community.

In fact, the Russians have committed numerous war crimes.
Propaganda: Russia's restraint in the war in Ukraine is caused by the moral principles that Moscow takes into account
NEWS: ""The USA is the main beneficiary of this international combination made on the territory of Ukraine, which aims to slow down Russia's development and create serious problems for it. [...] We will not proceed with Poland as we did on the territory of Ukraine during this foreign military operation. We must already take some firmer measures. The president said that we have not started anything.
[...] Russia has never had a geopolitical behavior that exceeded moral limits or ethical norms. The Anglo-Saxons and Western Europe were, are and will be the core of the Nazi ideology. For them, moral norms have no role. The respective states take into account only benefits and interests. [...] We were fighting with those who attacked us. Despite the lies and dirt in the Western press, we manage to explain to the Europeans what our point of view is.""
NARRATIVE: The moral principles that Russia takes into account do not allow it to quickly end the war in Ukraine.
Reality: Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, and the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Russian military did not take into account either the norms of international law or ethical or moral principles. Russia did not show restraint in the war, officially called by the Kremlin ""special military operation"". On the contrary, after launching numerous attacks against civilian targets (homes, schools, hospitals, etc.) Russia was designated a terrorist state first by the Parliament European and then by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.Only in Kherson at least 20 torture chambers were directly operated by the Russian FSB.
According to human rights organizations, the UN mission, independent journalists and experts, Russia has attacked civilian targets, resorted to cluster bombs, bombed hospitals and medical care facilities, tried to destroy Ukraine's electricity system, deported children and committed war crimes in the Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson regions.
In March of this year, the International Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin. The document shows that the Russian president failed to properly exercise control over civilian and military subordinates who committed criminal acts or allowed them to be committed.
In the context of the failure to achieve the goals of the ""special military operation"" announced by Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, the prolongation of the war and the launching of attacks by Kiev on Russia's border regions, the pro-Kremlin press explains the lack of reaction from Moscow by the necessity to take into account moral principles, which would be ""totally foreign"" to the West. A series of false narratives about Nazism in the West, as well as about Russophobia spread in European countries, are repeated.
At the same time, the Russian government press convinces the public opinion that the war continues because Russia shows restraint and mercy towards civilians. According to the false narratives, if instead of Ukraine it was Poland or Great Britain, these countries would be quickly destroyed by the Russian army, which used all possible methods. In reality, Russia has lost numerous battles, from that of Kiev to the Ukrainian counter-offensives in the fall of 2022. Moscow took the initiative at the end of last year, but the results of the offensive are more than modest, the Russian army being stuck in the battles of in Bahmut, a city of no strategic importance, according to military analysts.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Ukraine is a terrorist state that must be punished. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press demonstrates that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians would not - I support the Nazi leaders from Kiev. Publication / Media:

NEWS: The President of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, pleased the Moldovans with a new initiative - the creation of a ""Ministry of Truth"", as in George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984, believes the former Moldovan President, Igor Dodon, TASS reports. reacted the politician to the decision of the Moldovan leader regarding the new national center for combating propaganda, which would be the faces projected on the republic by Russia. ""Sandu delighted us with the establishment of a Ministry of Truth, as in George Orwell's famous novel 1984. Today , this is their main department, which will deal with the constant falsification of any important information from a social, statistical, historical point of view, the interpretation of events in the mass media, education, art and other areas of life"" - said Dodon. As the former president of the Republic of Moldova pointed out, the new center will be created on the eve of the local elections, which can be considered the prologue of the campaign for the position of state leader. He added that Sandu is trying to ""falsify reality"" together with the governing Action and Solidarity Party. [...] NARRATIVES: 1. There is no Russian propaganda in the Republic of Moldova. 2. The Chisinau government establishes the ""Patriot"" Center to combat disinformation to falsify important information.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to discredit the authorities' initiative to combat Russian propaganda and disinformation in the Republic of Moldova. At the same time, the author of the statements accuses Maia Sandu of trying to falsify reality.
CONTEXT: The President of the Republic of Moldova announced on May 29 the creation in Chisinau of a National Center for Informational Defense, which will be called ""Patriot"" and which will have the purpose of identifying, evaluating and combating disinformation and at the same time transmitting truthful information and to ensure the dialogue with the citizens. She warned that the Kremlin's hybrid attacks intensified with Russia's brutal war in Ukraine and stated that the lies broadcast on television and on the Internet have become the most dangerous weapons with which the Republic of Moldova is attacked.
The Republic of Moldova is very vulnerable from an information point of view and represents a fertile ground for Russian propaganda, because a large part of the citizens get their information mainly from Russian sources. Experts have warned for several years about the vulnerability of the country's informational space, in the context in which it has been dominated for 30 years by television and radio stations broadcast from the Russian Federation and by media holdings owned by corrupt politicians. These are in a much larger number than the Romanian stations, although the majority of the population of the Republic of Moldova are native speakers of the Romanian language (almost all ethnic Romanians also speak Russian). Even if, in the context of the Russian war of aggression, the authorities banned the rebroadcasting of Russian news programs and even suspended the license of some stations owned by the pro-Russian parties that were rebroadcasting Russian programs, the Kremlin's propaganda is still quite strong. The impact of Russian disinformation on national security can be seen by the support of the population of the Republic of Moldova for the aggressive actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, which is over 20 percent in surveys. These citizens accept the fake news and false ideas propagated by the Russian Federation.
Russian and pro-Russian narratives are spread in the Republic of Moldova by people interested in maintaining the Russian vector. One of the exponents of the Kremlin and promoter of Russian propaganda is the former president of the state Igor Dodon, the leader of the Socialist Party, whom investigative media revealed to have connections with the FSB.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Republic of Moldova has been the target of false narratives launched by the Russian Federation and their local supporters for years. In recent years, the Veridica team has dismantled hundreds of materials that contained such narratives. The statement that the Republic of Moldova is not the target of Russian propaganda (or disinformation and fake news) is not only obviously false, but also hilarious.
Moreover, disinformation campaigns intensified in the context of the war in Ukraine (among the narratives promoted are those regarding the abandonment of neutrality and the involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the war in Ukraine, the outbreak of a conflict in Transnistria, the control of the state by the West, the building of a regime oppressive dictator etc.). The Republic of Moldova is, in fact, the target of a hybrid war of the Russian Federation, repeatedly denounced as such by the authorities in Chisinau. One of the characteristics of the hybrid war is precisely the instrumentalization of information, so that combating disinformation is a necessary defense measure.
In the Audiovisual Media Services Code of the Republic of Moldova (2019), a provision was introduced regarding the security of the informational space, through which news programs and broadcasts with informative-analytical content retransmitted from Russia, a country that has not ratified the Convention on cross-border television, were removed. Shortly after it came into force, the coalition between the Socialist Party and the Sor Party excluded this provision, respectively all news and programs from the Russian Federation returned to the media space in the Republic of Moldova. After the start of the war, the notion of disinformation was introduced into the law and these provisions were also reintroduced which prohibit television and radio programs with informative, informative-analytical, military and political content from the Russian Federation, audiovisual programs which, regardless of their origin, it justifies wars of aggression, denies war crimes and crimes against humanity or incites hatred. However, Russian propaganda is still very present in the online environment - which is not regulated, but is an increasingly important source of information - and especially on social networks.
Igor Dodon's accusations regarding the creation of a ""Minister of Truth"" are reminiscent of the techniques of relativizing truth and reality - Russian propaganda becomes, in the former president's speech, truth, the attempt to combat the efforts to dismantle this propaganda - or to tell the truth - it becomes an instrument in the hands of the state presented as oppressive; basically, the truth becomes a lie. It is a speech typical of the Orwellian universe that Dodon claims to denounce. Publication / Media:

In fact, she distorted an interview given by Andzej Duda.
Propaganda: Russia is getting closer to a victory over Ukraine
NEWS: ""The President of Poland Andrzej Duda in a dialogue with The Wall Street Journal journalist Almar Latour mentioned the successes of Vladimir Putin in the special operation in Ukraine. According to the Polish leader, some say that Putin was defeated because Finland joined NATO, being until now an undecided state. Duda drew attention to the fact that Putin has never been defeated in any war.
The President of Poland emphasized that the Russian army is clearly superior to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to him, Moscow is increasingly mobilizing its forces, and the economy is adapting to the state of war.
In addition, Andrzej Duda reminded that Russia is a nuclear superstate with enormous reserves of ammunition"", VESTI.RU wrote, describing the Polish leader's interview as a eulogy to the Russian army.
""Andrzej Duda declared that no matter how much some people laugh at Russia for sending old tanks from the 60s to the front, they are now defeating Ukraine. The Polish leader hastened to remind that the Russians entered Berlin as liberators during the Second World War or in Paris during Napoleon's time"", TSARGRAD TV reports, analyzing Duda's opinion as an awakening of the Polish leader from Western illusions.
NARRATION: The President of Poland, Andrzej Duda. says that Russia will win the war
Reality: Russia has not achieved any of its goals in the war in Ukraine, and the President of Poland believes in the victory of Kiev
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Russian government press took a series of statements made by Adrzej Duda for The Wall Street Journal out of context. Duda stated that the West hastened to draw some conclusions regarding the weakening of Russia following the war in Ukraine, but he did not say that Russia is achieving its goals in the ""special military operation"" or that the defeat of Ukraine is imminent. On the contrary, the Polish leader and expressed the hope that Putin will lose the war, but noted that there are over ""100 million Russians and less than 40 million Ukrainians"".
Comparing the military and demographic potential of Ukraine and Russia, Duda argued why the West should support Kiev. ""The more support they receive, the more modern systems they receive, the greater the chances are not only to stop the Russians, but also to be able to launch a successful counter-offensive and drive the Russians out of the country them,"" said the Polish president.
Andrzej Duda's speech is not one of recognizing Russia's superiority over Ukraine, nor of promoting the heroism of the Russian military in the past, but of warning the Western states about the danger of Russian aggression, which should not be underestimated after 15 months of war in Ukraine. Describing the potential of both states, the Polish president does not praise, but criticizes the Kremlin's methods in the war. ""Human life means nothing to Russians, while for Ukrainians, every life is worth as much as gold. These are different cultures"", mentioned Duda.
The Russian government press omitted these and other important fragments from the interview that contradict the pro-Kremlin propaganda. The interview was presented to the Russian public as a recognition by Ukraine's neighbors of Vladimir Putin's successes in the war in Ukraine. The Russian press, however, ignored Duda's assessment that Ukraine will defeat the Russian army ""after it is pushed beyond the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine"".
In reality, Russia has not achieved any of its goals in the war in Ukraine, and Kiev is preparing for a counteroffensive that will allow it to liberate as many territories occupied by the Russian army as possible. Requesting much greater support for Ukraine from Germany and France, Duda reminded his colleagues in Berlin and Paris about the sad pages of the past, adding that ""only the defeat of Russia will make us safe"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press demonstrates that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians would not - they support the Nazi leaders in Kiev According to the Russian government media, half of the military in the Ukrainian army are foreigners, which means that NATO is participating in the war.

Healthy origin, back in control
NEWS: ,,[...] Also, children are forbidden to photograph the forms that must be filled in directly on the laptop and they are warned that they cannot refuse to answer the questions. Practically, they are forced to stay in class and provide the data requested by a stranger sneaking into the premises exactly when the teacher is not there, an individual who does not decline his identity and does not say which institution he legally represents. The parents were not informed in advance about the presence of strangers in the school, nor about the forms in the laptops. They only knew about TIMSS and about the mandatory participation in the testing strictly for mathematics. However, the obligation to participate in TIMMS was later denied by the Ministry of Education. Sources from the school inspectorate declare that they have no information and data about these events. The ""interrogations"" of the minors took place in the absence of a parent or guardian designated by a specialized court, as the law provides in such cases. But... who cares? The first step has been taken towards separating the children from their parents. The action of raising children who have ""non-compliant"" parents.[...]""
NARRATIVES: 1. The Romanian state has started creating a database of children who will be separated from their parents. 2. In Suceava, the first camp is being built for children who will be separated from their families.
CONTEXT: The narrative according to which Romanian children will be separated from their families has been circulating in the domestic public space for some time, taking various forms. In January, independent senator Diana Sosoaca launched a scenario that enters a family of narratives related to conspiracy theories related to children, from their forced separation from their parents to PizzaGate and QAnon. They were also adapted to the Romanian ethos in the cases of Sorina Sacarin's adoption and the separation of children from their parents in Norway. Elements of this thesis were also used by the Russian war propaganda, which claims that thousands of Ukrainian children are sold in the West, to cover their kidnappings and deportations to Russia. At the beginning of the month, a large protest of the AUR party, officially directed against the bad governance in Bucharest, turned into one full of absurd claims, one of them targeting exactly this theory.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the authorities and the entire political class, demonizing the West, promoting sovereignist discourse, but also xenophobic and racist attitudes, as well as provoking and amplifying social tensions.
School performance and the factors that influence it
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Since 1995, Romania has been participating in the TIMSS surveys, a form of evaluation that focuses on students' mathematical and scientific skills. They take place once every four years to document the longer-term developments of the participating education systems and have two parts: the actual testing of the students and the response to four different context questionnaires: the questionnaire for the school, the questionnaire for the mathematics teacher , the questionnaire for the science teacher and the questionnaire for students, all representing integral parts of the survey. For clarification, I spoke with the deputy coordinator of the TIMSS National Center, Dr. Vlad Burtaverde, a lecturer at the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences of the University of Bucharest, the institution under whose aegis the TIMSS tests are carried out in Romania. He assured us that the TIMSS methodology is standardized, that is, each participating country does things exactly the same, so that the results make sense. Prior to participating in the survey, the children's parents are informed about both of its components, testing and survey, and their agreement implies the acceptance of both sides. Vlad Burtaverde told us that, ""thus, every student, in addition to the math and science test, also completes the Home context questionnaire, where there are questions about his life context, which is important in the analyzes and reports that are made after project in each country. In other words, it makes no sense to follow only the performance level of the students, without knowing what are the ""predictors"", the causes that lead to high or low performance. To capture these nuances, it is followed whether school performance is influenced the level of the children's socio-economic status, the level of education of the parents, etc. What is extremely important to know is that the data are not analyzed nominally, but at the level of the sample, of the country. In the databases, the student <<Popescu Ionut>> appears with a numerical ID, not with his name, the tests and questionnaires are not signed."" In this sense, the coordinators of the project in Romania do not have access to tools that could modify or influence the testing, they are exclusively online, generated by the IEA - the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Performance, Vlad Burtaverde also says. He also clarifies the problem of the question through which children are asked to identify their gender: ""The variants Boy, girl, others are only the standard wording used for inclusive purposes in several states, in order not to discriminate against minorities and nothing more.""
In essence, the conspiracy exposition abounds in strong lacks of logic, being sprinkled at the same time with xenophobic and racist elements (""Mixing is like the beginning. We already have mixed marriages with the traveling birds""), or false and discriminatory (""Rich families I give the world the most children with reduced intellect, physically and mentally ill."").
 The construction, in Suceava county, of a day center for children at risk of being separated from their parents, does not aim to separate children from ""non-compliant"" parents, but the exact opposite. These centers aim to support families with care and raising children, having a program similar to an after school, a concept already present in the public education system, through the ""School after school"" program. Specifically, during the day, after school hours, the children will have hot meals, care from specialists, education adapted to their age, they will do their homework and receive psychological counseling. In the evening they will return home to their families, avoiding dropping out of school or ending up in the care of the state due to poverty. Such day care centers have existed throughout Romania for years, being financed and cared for both by the state and by various private organizations, from NGOs considered by ultraconservative propaganda to be on the side of the occult, to churches and foundations of Christian orientation.

In fact, the aim is to strengthen Moldova's resilience to security risks.
NEWS: The EU is trying to bring the Republic of Moldova to a confrontation with Moscow, and the anti-Russian message of its civilian mission in this country is not hidden either, Deputy Foreign Minister Mihail Galuzin said in an interview for Ria Novosti.
[...]
We see that when adopting the decision regarding the creation of the new structure on the ground, in the post-Soviet space, the EU was guided by geopolitical reasons. The EU is trying to strengthen the pro-Western course of the Moldovan leadership and to put the country in front of a confrontation with Russia, ignoring the interests and predispositions of the population. The anti-Russian message of the new EU present is not even hidden,"" said the diplomat.
According to Galuzin, under the slogan of the fight against ""hybrid threats, foreign informational influence"", censorship will be imposed in the country, Western values ​​will be imposed, everything Russian will be eliminated.
NARRATIVES: The EU wants to push Moldova towards a confrontation with Russia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is considered the most vulnerable country and a first target in the event of a successful Russian military invasion of Ukraine. Neutral through the Constitution adopted in 1994 by a center-left Parliament, in the context of open (Transnistria) or latent (Gagauzia) secessions, the Republic of Moldova has oscillated, in the more than 30 years of independence, between East and West. The country is dependent on Russian energy resources (Gazprom gas and electricity from Transnistria, a separatist region supported economically, politically and militarily by Moscow). At the same time, there is a Russian-speaking minority of about 20%, and a significant part of the population connected to Russian culture/mass media/showbiz, including through the hundreds of thousands of Moldovans who went to work in Russia, so public opinion is still divided regarding the foreign policy vector. However, the majority of the population opts for European integration, as the polls show, as well as the results of the last elections, which brought pro-European politicians and parties to power.
With the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the propaganda messages of the Russian press and officials intensified, amplified by the mass media and pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau. One of the narratives is that the Republic of Moldova is governed, de facto, by the West, which pushes it towards war with Russia, despite its status of neutrality.
OBJECTIVE: To feed the fear of war in society and to associate the European Union with the danger of the confrontation between the Republic of Moldova and Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: On April 24, the EU Council established the EU partnership mission in the Republic of Moldova (EUPM Moldova) within the framework of the common security and defense policy (PSAC). The objective of this civilian mission is to increase the resilience of the security sector of this country in the field of crisis management and hybrid threats, including in terms of cyber security and countering foreign information manipulation actions and foreign interference. EUPM Moldova was launched on May 22.
The mission is a civil, consulting and support mission for Moldova to face the challenges in the context of the hybrid war waged by Russia and, respectively, it has neither technical nor logistical skills to prepare the Republic of Moldova to provoke confrontations with Russia.
Nothing in the objectives of this mission suggests that it would have an anti-Russian character, as stated by the official of the MAE in Moscow.
All opinion polls show that the majority of the population of the Republic of Moldova opts for joining the EU, so the intention of the Chisinau authorities to take the Republic of Moldova on this path does not contradict the expectations of the population, as declared by Mihail Galuzin.
The introduction of censorship in the Republic of Moldova is another narrative of Russian propaganda and pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau, who thus comment on the efforts of the Chisinau authorities to fight the fake news phenomenon. The Republic of Moldova has climbed two years in a row with over 60 positions in the chapter of press freedom, in a top compiled by the international organization ""Reporters without Borders"". This year, the Republic of Moldova is in 28th place, having the best index of freedom of the press in Southeast Europe and similar to that of some states with democratic traditions such as Austria and Australia.

Putin's historical amnesia: the Tatars and the Khanate of Crimea
kremlin.ru / May 23, 2023; @crimeaplatform/twitter.com / May 18, 2023; rferl.com / May 24, 2023
On May 23, pro-Kremlin TV broadcasted an alleged new proof of what Russian propaganda calls the ""lack of legitimacy"" of a Ukrainian state. The President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, Valeri Zorkin, excitedly presented Vladimir Putin with a French map from the second half of the 17th century, telling him that today's territory of Ukraine was included in the borders of the Polish-Lithuanian Union. Satisfied, Putin resumed the thesis of the inventory of Ukraine by the Bolshevik Revolution, without realizing that, nevertheless, on the four-century-old map, the name ""Ukraine"" appears written in French in the Kiev area. The Russian president, who again invoked the alleged ""historical rights of Russia"", something else escaped him: on the map drawn in the era of Louis XIV, the territory on which his native St. Petersburg stands today was called Ingria and was part of the Swedish Empire. Moreover, on the same map from the time of the musketeers of Alexandre Dumas, an autonomous state formation called the Khanate of the Tatars, which had already accumulated over 200 years of existence, stretched across the Crimea. In 1783, when it was conquered by Tsarist Russia of Empress Catherine II, the Crimean peninsula was inhabited by over 92% Tatars. 250 years later, following a persistent process of Russification, the Crimean Tatars fell to less than 20 percent of the total population. Too many, according to Stalin. On May 18, 1944, the dictator decided to forcibly deport 200,000 Tatars to Siberia. The propaganda motive was the alleged mass desertion of Tatars recruited into the Red Army before the Nazis. Only that the regular Soviet army numbered over 17,000 Tatar soldiers before the Hitler invasion, and they fought until the end of the war. Many were decorated for feats of arms, such as aviator Amet Khan Sultan, twice Hero of the Soviet Union. Another argument for deportation - the collaboration of all Crimean Tatars with the Nazis - does not stand, since the Tatar collaborators were either killed or arrested by the NKVD. In addition, punishing an entire people for the reprehensible acts of some individuals falls within the definition of crimes against humanity, if not genocide. A third false argument was the so-called ""criminal"" and treacherous nature of the Tatars, who would have been ""saved"" by deportation from the anger of the majority of Crimean residents and soldiers returning from the war. A ridiculous assertion, since Khan Sultan himself, the multiple decorated pilot for weapons feats, was not allowed by the Soviets to return to his native Crimea. In fact, the deported Tatars and their descendants could not return to Crimea until after 1990, under the conditions that during the USSR, even their distinct ethnic identity was not recognized. In 1991, the repatriated Tatars voted massively for the independence of Ukraine, contributing to over 50% of favorable votes in Crimea. The illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 made many go into exile again. For the remaining men, the compulsory mobilization imposed by the occupiers last fall put them in an impossible situation: how to fight against the country for whose independence you voted? Many see in the forced recruitment a new attempt by the Russians to get rid of them, given that 90% of the incorporation orders targeted the Tatar community, although today it represents at most 15% of the population. It is not the only evidence of persecution. At the beginning of spring, of the 180 political prisoners in Crimea, 116 were Tatars. Meanwhile, their number increased. Most of them are accused of belonging to Hizb ut-Tahir, a religious group banned in Russia but legal in Ukraine. On Wednesday, a member of the group named Ernes Seitosmanov was sentenced by a court in Rostov to 18 years in prison for what the judges described as ""terrorism"". Five days before, on the very day of his 79th birthday deportation of Crimean Tatars, the occupation authorities forbade the organization of any commemorative demonstration. Tatars from Simferopol defied the restriction and gathered in one of the city's squares in memory of the victims of the genocide. A genocide committed on Stalin's order and omitted by Russian propaganda at Putin's order.
Elon Musk, guarantor of ""accurate"" disinformation
afp.com / Apr. 19 2023; euronews.com / Apr. 27 / 2023
Elon Musk promised when taking over Twitter that he would turn the platform into the most accurate source of information in the whole world. Six months after the completion of the transaction, Musk proves to be a diligent promoter of the most notorious misinformers on the Internet. This is the conclusion of the France Presse agency, after analyzing the online activity of the American-South African billionaire. His posts systematically direct the followers' attention to the most popular manipulations, from those regarding the war in Ukraine to the so-called Covid-19 conspiracy. For example, Musk amplified through his dry comments the thesis of alleged medical errors in the diagnosis of the virus supported by a user who promotes the QAnon conspiracy theories. Hidden behind a fake profile, in a few months, that user enjoyed more than 40 times the attention of Musk, who otherwise rarely intervenes on Twitter. Journalists also discovered that Musk helped distribute a fake news story attributed to CNN, which suggested that the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol in January 2021 were guided by the police. The billionaire also amplified the spread on Twitter of the theory of the guilt of the LGBT community for the mass shootings in Colorado Springs and propagated falsehoods regarding the number of Ukrainians killed in the war. Experts say that Elon Musk's posts, followed by 135 million users, are particularly dangerous. In addition to the enormous online influence, the owner of Twitter can count on a team of high-performance engineers who can increase the penetration of the messages sent. When AFP tried to find out his point of view, Twitter generated an automatic response with a rude emoticon, which seems to reflect Elon Musk's true opinion about free, decent and fair communication.

In reality, Kiev is being supported to face the military aggression of the Russian Federation.
Propaganda: NATO is pouring ""gas on the fire"" in the war in Ukraine to cause a global war
NEWS: Through its actions, NATO is pouring gas on the fire in Ukraine to generate a global explosion [of the conflict], wrote former French MEP Florian Philippot on his Twitter account.
He reacted to the statement of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg who said that sooner or later Ukraine will join the Alliance.
""These madmen pour gas on the fire, without taking into account the possible consequences, they support the war to cause a world explosion,"" Philippot wrote.
According to the former deputy, NATO must be stopped. ""In the name of peace, please stop NATO, let's leave the Alliance quickly"", mentioned the politician.
[...] The press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, mentioned that Moscow is closely following the situation and recalled that Kiev's orientation towards the North Atlantic Alliance became one of the reasons for launching the special military operation in Ukraine"".
NARRATIVE: NATO supports Ukraine to cause a world war.
Reality: NATO states are not part of the conflict, but support Ukraine's defensive efforts against Russian aggression
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, NATO is not part of the conflict in Ukraine, but only supports Kiev's right to defend itself against military aggression. ""Ukraine has the right to self-defense. We help Ukraine to uphold that right. This does not make the North Atlantic Alliance or NATO member states parties to the conflict,"" Jens Stoltenberg said, justifying the training of Ukrainian military pilots.
According to art. 51 of the UN Charter, member states have the ""inherent right to individual or collective self-defense in the event of an armed attack"". Ukraine's pro-NATO orientation cannot be a justification for starting a war, as the opinion tries to convince publishes the press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov. Russia's large-scale invasion against Ukraine has been repeatedly categorized as an unprovoked armed attack by the UN General Assembly. Therefore, some NATO countries support Ukraine not to cause a war worldwide, but to help Kiev defend itself against a military aggression condemned by the international community.
The Russian government press and Telegram channels present the statements of the former French MEP as a new current of opinion dominant in Paris. In reality, Florian Philippot is a supporter and follower of the ideas of the president of the National Front Marine Le Pen, known as a partner of the Putin regime in France. Philippot was vice-president of the National Front and coordinator of the electoral campaign of the candidate, who represented the French extreme right in the elections. At the moment, Philippot coordinates the nationalist party ""Patriots"", little known in French society.
Based on the posts on his Twitter account, the Russian government press produces fake news about the anti-NATO attitudes in France and the crumbling West. In January this year Florian Philippot declared that the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky wants world nuclear war. He criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for falling in love with Zelenski and supports him unconditionally. In October 2022, the politician accused NATO of organizing diversions at the Russian gas pipeline ""Nord Stream"", claiming that he has information that Russia is not to blame. Florian Philippot is often cited by the Moscow press to illustrate false narratives about the nature of the war from Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. Russian journalists argued that the US will send 200 thousand Ukrainian suicide bombers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, to the offensive. Russian propaganda tries to convince public opinion that the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the war in Ukraine is in Zelensky's interest. Publication / Media:

The false narrative ignores a number of important milestones in Ukrainian history.
NEWS: Ukraine did not exist in the history of mankind until the emergence of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, said Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting with the President of the Constitutional Court, Valeri Zorkin.
He brought the president a map made in France in the 17th century, in which the territories that were part of the Russian Land, the Kazakh State and the Polish-Lithuanian Union are represented, emphasizing that Ukraine does not appear there.
""After the October revolution, a series of artificial state formations appeared, and the Soviet power created Soviet Ukraine, which is generally known. Until then, Ukraine did not exist in the history of mankind"", declared the head of state while looking at the old map brought by Zorkin. NARRATIVE: Ukraine did not exist until the creation of the USSR.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the context of the large-scale invasion of Russia, the false narratives that aim to demonstrate that Ukraine is an artificial state were resumed or developed in another form. On July 12, 2021, the article ""On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians"" signed by President Vladimir Putin was published on the Kremlin website. The Russian President then presented the history of the Ukrainian people from the point of view of official Russian historiography, arguing that Ukraine is a ""margin"" of Russia, and the Zaporizhzhya Cossacks were convinced Orthodox Russians. Vladimir Putin questioned the existence of Ukrainians as a people, calling them ""Little Russians"", that is, smaller Russians, who have no historical right to a separate state from Russia. The Russian president claims that Ukraine is entirely the fruit of the Soviet era, being created at the expense of historical Russia. The Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin was accused several times by Vladimir Putin of offering national republics the right to leave the USSR. The Russian leader wrote that Ukraine's borders are a subject of international negotiations.
OBJECTIVE: To convince public opinion that Ukraine's borders are negotiable because this state was created by Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin had to create the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to appease the spirits following the Russian-Ukrainian war of 1917-1920. In the context of the Bolshevik revolution, the Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed in Kiev in 1918, which had diplomatic relations with a number of states, including Romania. There was a Ukrainian diplomatic representation in Bucharest and a temporary Romanian diplomatic mission in Kiev. The leaders of the Ukrainian People's Republic spoke out against communism. The new Ukrainian state was conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1920.
The Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin had to create a national socialist republic for the Ukrainians, offering them a political guarantee that the socio-economic transformations will take place in the context of preserving their linguistic identity. Fearing the strong nationalist currents in the Soviet Union, the Bolsheviks approved in 1923 the doctrine of ""autochthonization"" of power in the new republics, giving the Ukrainians a wide cultural autonomy in parallel with a total ideological control, according to research conducted by Jorg Baberowski.
So, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was created by the Bolsheviks to satisfy the demands of the Ukrainians to have their own national state and to avoid a new civil war in the former Russian Empire. A series of sad pages in the history of the Ukrainian people followed - the abandonment of ""autochthonization"" as a political doctrine and the Holodomor of 1932-1933, organized by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian national elite.
The Kremlin also misinforms the public about the non-existence of Ukraine on a map from the 17th century. In reality, Russia does not even exist on that map, it appeared much later, in 1721, when the Russian Empire was declared. Until then, the Muscovite Tarat appeared on the maps, and the successors of the historical traditions of Kievan Rus were the Knei from the present-day west of Ukraine. In the 13th century, prince Danilo Halitki from the historical western Ukrainian area was crowned by Pope Innocent IV as king of Galicia and the whole of Russia.
After the annexation of Crimea and the launch of the war in Donbass, the founder of Ukrainian historiography Mihailo Grusevschi, who wrote in 1903 that Russia and the Russians bear this name unjustly, being, in fact, a people composed of Slavs and Mongols. The historian argued a hundred years ago that Ukrainians are the heirs of historical Russia with its center in Kiev. Two days before the invasion of the Ukrainian state, on February 24, 2022, the US Embassy in Ukraine posted on Facebook an image showing that Kiev had churches and cathedrals before the city of Moscow was documented.
Russian propaganda successfully uses the difficulties of translating the notions of ""ruski"" (refers to former Kievan Russia) and ""rosiiski"" (refers to today's Russia) into European languages. For example, if for Russian and Ukrainian there are two different words, then for the Romanian language, for example, both are translated as ""Russian"". This is where the confusion arises that Russia is the successor state of Kievan Rus.
The Kremlin leader admitted that a Cossack state was represented on the map from the 17th century, but did not specify what it was called. The map can be found in various open access sources. This map, also published by Gallica, shows in the center of today's Ukraine a state called ""Ukraine - Pays des Cosaques"", which would translate as ""Ukraine - the country of the Cossacks"" from the Lithuanian-Polish Union component, something omitted in the information published by the Russian press.
The resumption of these false narratives about the history of the Ukrainian people takes place in the context of a large-scale invasion of Russia against Ukraine, which has lasted more than 15 months. The Kremlin is trying to convince the public opinion that the borders of the Ukrainian state are a subject of negotiations in which Russia has the historical and political right to participate, because it was Moscow that created this state.

The narrative is refuted even by Moscow's actions in the last 30 years.
NEWS: ""Unlike Western states, Russia does not get involved in the internal affairs of other states, including the Republic of Moldova,"" Zaharova said during the briefing. She added that Moscow is convinced that the normalization of relations with Russia, preserving the benefits of participation in the CIS is in the interests of the Republic of Moldova and its citizens
""We call on the Moldovan leadership to take into account the entire spectrum of opinions of the country's inhabitants, to avoid actions that lead to political polarization and the artificial destabilization of the public life of the republic"", emphasized Zaharova. NARRATIVE: Russia is a fair partner, which respects the rules of international law and the decisions of the states in the region, compared to the West, which gets involved in their internal affairs.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Chisinau-Moscow relations cooled considerably after the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, criticized by the pro-European authorities of the Republic of Moldova. Chisinau did not officially join the international sanctions against Russia, but it offered batches of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, allowed the transit of oil products and provided aid to Ukrainian refugees.
During the last year, there have been several exchanges between the representatives of the Foreign Ministries of the two countries, but also at the level of high-ranking officials, and recently there have been mutual expulsions of diplomats.
Moscow accuses Chisinau of being controlled by the West and making anti-Russian decisions, of trying to get closer to NATO, of violating the neutrality statute, of violating the rights of the Russian-speaking minority. The Kremlin ended up criticizing Chisinau also because the Parliament decided (following a decision of the Constitutional Court from 2013) to replace the name of the language from Moldovan to Romanian.
On the other hand, the authorities of the Republic of Moldova have repeatedly condemned Russia's intervention in its internal affairs and attempts to destabilize the situation and that it is trying to establish a pro-Russian government in Chisinau by undemocratic means. The war launched by Russia had direct consequences on the Republic of Moldova, economically, by increasing prices, primarily for energy resources imported from Russia (gas) and the destruction of transport logistics, but also of security. Due to the missile attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, power outages occurred several times in the Republic of Moldova. Several Russian missiles flew over the country's airspace, and several parts of the missile fell on its territory.
OBJECTIVE: To present Russia as a fair international partner, compared to the West that interferes in the internal affairs of sovereign states (the Republic of Moldova).
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Despite the statements of Maria Zaharova, Moscow, through its actions, or the statements of some officials, demonstrated direct or indirect involvement in the Republic of Moldova by supporting some pro-Russian politicians, trying to determine the vector of foreign policy, including through energy blackmail and economic war, the maintenance of a Russian military contingent on the territory of the Republic of Moldova and the support of the separatist administration from Tiraspol, thus fueling the Transnistrian conflict, an impediment to the country's development.
In February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced at an official meeting in Brussels that the Ukrainian secret services had intercepted a plan by Moscow to destabilize the situation in the Republic of Moldova. Later, the Information and Security Service of the Republic of Moldova confirmed that it had detected such plans. Later, the president Maia Sandu declared that the Russian plan involved para-military units of foreign fighters, in civilian clothes, which would then attack state institutions and take hostages, the actions being masked by the protests of the pro-Russian opposition, especially Sister Party.
Moscow denied the accusations, but it would not be the first time that it would try to influence the political situation in Chisinau. For example, in the last presidential elections, in 2020, Vladimir Putin openly supported Igor Dodon, who, however, lost them.
The American sanctions imposed in October 2022 on several individuals and entities from Russia and the Republic of Moldova, including the Sor Party and its leader, the fugitive politician Ilan Sor, sentenced to 15 years in prison for participating in the large-scale bank robbery of 2014, is an argument in plus regarding Russia's involvement in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova. The list also included Russian businessmen and political strategists affiliated with some Moldovan politicians, including the former president, Igor Dodon. They would have tried to keep the Republic of Moldova in the sphere of Russian influence, getting involved in the 2021 parliamentary elections, and a year later, organizing protests aimed at overthrowing the pro-European government.
Starting in 2020, Rise Moldova published a series of investigations that demonstrated Igor Dodon's strong connections with representatives of the Russian intelligence services, from which he also received money. The last of the series of articles, published in March 2023, refers to the document that the international press also wrote about, regarding a Russian plan to bring the Republic of Moldova under its umbrella by 2030
However, political analysts and some politicians from Chisinau believe that Russia has always had levers of influence over the Republic of Moldova, which it used during the more than 30 years of the country's independence. It is primarily about the secessionist conflict in the east of the country. Moscow would have always threatened Chisinau with the recognition of the separatist region, which it supported financially and politically. In addition, Russia maintains a Soviet-era military depot in the region, guarded by a military contingent, despite the fact that the Republic of Moldova has repeatedly requested their withdrawal and even Moscow committed more than 20 years ago that it would this thing.
The dependence of the Republic of Moldova on Russian gas was another influencing factor. The last evidence of energy blackmail was recorded in the fall of 2022, when Russia did not increase deliveries, starting with October, thus forcing Chisinau to resort to other more expensive and less secure solutions. However, the Republic of Moldova found solutions, so that currently it imports Russian gas only for the separatist region of Transnistria, where it gets its electricity. Those gases are delivered free of charge to the separatist region, largely ensuring its economic support and its industry; the amounts are imputed to Chisinau, which over time has accumulated billions of dollars in debt to Russia, debts that represent an extra leverage for the latter.
Over the years, Moscow has also blackmailed the Republic of Moldova economically by threatening, or even taking action, with bans on agricultural production in the Republic of Moldova. The last most important decision in this regard was taken in 2014, after the Republic of Moldova signed the Association Agreement with the EU. The result was that some of the Moldovan producers reoriented themselves towards the EU market or identified others, and the Republic of Moldova reduced its dependence on the Russian one.

It sounds like a methodical plan for a discreet invasion of the country, colonization explicitly prohibited by the Romanian Constitution. [...] Since 2021, 250,000 work permits have been granted for people from outside Europe. Migrants are not really the poorest in their countries, since they can afford to invest between 5,000 and 12,000 euros for the Romanian adventure, money with which you can buy a house in the lands where they come from. [...] is the oldest security scheme to put Romanians to sleep with the refrain: we are a country of horror, no one wants to come, no one wants to stay, sleep peacefully as the invasion passes. Observation from the street with the naked eye denies this hypothesis. The quarter of a million has definitely come and settled to stay with relatives.""
NARRATIVES: 1. Romania will be invaded by Asians, who will colonize significant territories of the country. 2. Romania is a far too tolerant country, and the authorities hide the problems caused by immigrants.
CONTEXT: Romania has been facing a considerable labor shortage in several fields for some time. Official estimates claim that approximately one million workers would be needed to cover this deficit. The last population census of Romania shows that the country is on a downward demographic trend, which will continue in the future. Specialists' forecasts indicate constant downward trends until 2100. This means that the rate of replacement of exits from the working-age population category by new entries is also in sharp decline in the medium and long term. The main cause of this phenomenon is the massive exodus of the population abroad, but it is also combined with the demographic factor, translated into the low birth rate, the educational factor, represented by the lack of vocational schools to train future professionals, or the social factor, materialized by the lack of interest the young generation to still have manual jobs, which involve working in car services, in factories, or in agriculture. This accumulation of factors brought Romania to a situation of dependence on the import of labor force. It is no longer a short-term solution but a long-term one, and the Romanian society must get used to this situation.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting xenophobic and racist discourse and attitudes among public opinion in Romania, undermining the population's trust in the authorities, as well as provoking and amplifying social tensions.
The Constitution of Romania and the right to work of foreign citizens
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Although it seems obvious, we are forced to insist on the ridiculousness of the hypothesis in which the ""coastal bosses"" organized to provoke an Asian invasion of Romania. The help they give to their own employees to reunite with their families can only be praised, showing the employers' interest in the psycho-emotional comfort of the workers. In any case, we cannot talk about a ""colonization"" of the Romanian coast or other geographical areas. The very definition of colonization, that of populating a conquered country or region with people brought from other territories or from other countries and the transfer of resources or production to the conquering state, shows that in fact we are dealing with a trivial relocation of the population, natural demographic phenomenon, in which the Romanian people also take part, through excessive migration to Western Europe. The Asian immigrants who choose to live and work in Romania obey local laws, do not take property by force and do not impose their language, culture and lifestyle on the local population.
Invoking Article 3 of the Romanian Constitution is nonsense. The paragraph in question has the role of establishing the inalienable nature of Romania's territory, which means that it cannot be ceded, neither partially nor fully, to other states. In no case does it refer to the temporary shelter, for humanitarian, economic or social reasons, of a foreign population, which has absolutely nothing to do with colonization. The employment of foreign citizens in Romania is regulated by several normative acts, including the Labor Code and, in principle, involves the completion of several stages, both by employers and employees: obtaining the employment permit, obtaining a long-stay visa, obtaining the right of residence, the issuance of a residence permit for the purpose of work. In addition, at the international level, labor migration is regulated by several conventions and treaties of the EU or UN, which Romania is obliged to respect and which do not at all contradict the provisions of the Constitution.
The material to which we refer invokes a number of 250,000 Asian immigrants settled in Romania from 2021 to the present, only that it is a fake one. In 2021, the government approved a quota of 50,000 foreign workers newly admitted to the labor market in Romania, but only approximately 38,000 employment permits were issued. In 2022, with the increase of the contingent of newly admitted foreign workers to 100,000, at the level of the General Inspectorate for Immigration, approximately 109,000 employment permits were issued in total (extension + new permits). However, it should be mentioned that, despite the issuance of these permits, not all approved jobs are occupied. Thus, in 2022, approximately 85,000 foreign citizens were officially employed in Romania, the number including all foreign employees, not only those from South and Southeast Asia. Of these, over 10,000 were Turkish citizens, almost 8,000 Moldovan citizens, over 6,000 Ukrainians, and approximately 3,500 Italians. At this moment, the workers from abroad (including Europe) who work on the territory of Romania are a little over 100,000, according to the data provided by the authorities.
The remark related to the financial status of Asian workers is deeply discriminatory, its author not taking into account the fact that most of those who end up in the situation of emigrating to Europe make huge financial sacrifices in order to collect the necessary money for the road, permits and other travel documents. In the same way, the comparison between their incomes and those of teachers (brought into discussion in the context of the general strike in education started at the beginning of the week) is inappropriate and unfair to immigrants. The size of salaries in the private sector is the option of the employers, unrelated to the salary scales in the public sector, which are the responsibility of the government.
Regarding the tolerance of Romanians towards immigrants who come to work, we do not understand how it could be presented in a negative tone, being eminently a reason for pride and a model of social behavior. In addition, there is absolutely no statistics or information that attests to an increase in criminality on Romanian territory associated with immigration from Asian countries. On the contrary, the Asian immigrants make efforts to learn our language, to adopt the customs of the place, hoping for a faster integration into the Romanian society. Publication / Media:

General Ben Hodges' statement was actually modified.
Propaganda: The Ukrainian counter-offensive will be a total failure, because the West no longer believes in the success of Ukraine in the war
NEWS: ""Ben Hodges said in an interview for Business Insider that the US could cause the Ukrainian counter-offensive to fail because they put too much pressure on Kiev.
The former commander of NATO troops in Europe believes that the states of the West are aware of the catastrophic situation of Ukraine in the front area. Western leaders understand that sooner or later the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be defeated.
This aspect is important in the context of the future counteroffensive. [...] Not all members of the Biden Administration want a victory for Ukraine. For this reason, Washington is not able to propose a clear strategy regarding the Ukrainian conflict"", mentions Tsargrad TV, analyzing a possible failure of the Ukrainian counter-offensive.
""The West was practically defeated in the war with Russia caused by Ukraine. Therefore, the promised counteroffensive may not take place. These discussions are held not only by officials or politicians who are in power, but also by political activists or skeptical military analysts. Even the politicians' statements are increasingly pessimistic"", writes INOSMI.RU, stating that Russia's victory in the war in Ukraine is imminent.
NARRATIVE: The West believes that Ukraine will lose the war with Russia.
Reality: The West supports Ukraine's war effort, including with military equipment intended for the counteroffensive
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ben Hodges' words were taken out of context and, in addition, the reserve general was attributed with statements illustrating Russian propaganda theses. The former commander of the American armed forces in Europe did not mention in his interview for Business Insider any imminent defeat of Ukraine in the war, the impossibility of organizing a successful counteroffensive or an alleged catastrophic situation of Ukraine in the front area. Hodges did not say that Western leaders ""understand that sooner or later the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be defeated"". with the preparation of a counteroffensive, mentioning the bravery of the Ukrainian military and the ""general disorganization"" of the Russian army. He called on the West to be more united and to continue to support Ukraine, which is fighting for international order. The Russian government press omitted these fragments from the interview because they contradict the Kremlin's official narratives. Hodges emphasized that there is great pressure on Kiev, but he did not show himself to be unconfident in the chances of success of this or other military operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
At the same time, the Russian press writes that the West is practically defeated by Russia on the territory of Ukraine, the proof being the postponement of the counteroffensive. In reality, the West is not part of the conflict in Ukraine, but only helps Kiev to defend itself.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. According to the Russian press, the USA will send 200 thousand Ukrainian suicide bombers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, to the offensive. Russian propaganda is trying to convince public opinion that the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the EU has sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that the War in Ukraine is in Zelensky's interest. Publication / Media:

The elections in Turkey marked by misinformation and deepfakes
dw.com / May 8, 2023; euronews.com / May 16, 2023; france24.com / May 15, 2023
With the outcome postponed until next Sunday, the presidential election confrontation in Turkey has so far proven to be a competition of disinformation between the camps of the protagonists Recep Tayyp Erdogan and Kemal Kilicdaroglu. And here, as at the polls, the incumbent president and his supporters were detached. A week before the vote, during an election rally, Erdogan showed his supporters on a screen a video with his political opponent Kilicdaroglu, urging the viewers to vote. Next, in the images apparently filmed in the recent campaign, a character in military uniform can be distinguished. He is Murat Karaylan, co-founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, classified as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States. The intention of the incumbent president is clear: the association of his opponent with the PKK, a party outlawed in Turkey as well. However, the clip is counterfeited by combining fragments from two different recordings in terms of date and context. The first is, indeed, an original clip, available on YouTube, in which Kilicdaroglu mobilizes his voters. The second one, in which the PKK leader appears, is from August 2021 and was spotted by journalists from Deutshe Welle on the website of Firat News Agency, a Kurdish publication. Another video, this time from the Deepfake category, shows Erdogan's rival delivering his election message in perfect English. Distributed on social networks at the beginning of the month, the clip - which, although rudimentarily made, gathered hundreds of thousands of views - turned out to be the creation of a passionate IT user who was exploring the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence for fun. It was not at all funny for Muharrem Ince, the candidate for the presidency of the secular Party of the Fatherland, to recognize himself during the week of the elections in a video of a sexual nature distributed on the Internet. Ince denounced the fake and explained that it was a video taken from an Israeli pornographic site in which his face was digitally inserted. Disgusted, the teacher who in the 2018 elections had obtained over 30% of the votes in the confrontation with Erdogan announced his withdrawal from the electoral race, but his name remained on the already printed ballots. The forgeries and manipulations did not stop even after the polls closed. On May 14, a clip appeared on a Francophone Twitter account with a crowd of people celebrating the supposed victory of opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu in the street. In reality, the images viewed by over 500,000 users were filmed a year ago and show the joy of thousands of fans of the Trabzonspor football team after winning the national championship. Another, more elaborate intoxication, presents an alleged proof of the betrayal in the elections of Ali Babacan, a prominent supporter of Kilicdaroglu. A photo of a voting booth was posted on a fake Twitter account, which has since been closed, from which it appeared that Babacan had put his stamp on Erdogan's name. After comparing the posted image with the filmed sequence of the politician's vote, France 24 journalists found proof of the hoax in a detail: while the voter in the photo wears moccasins, the Turkish politician went to the polls with patent leather shoes. Erdogan's opponents also complained about the tolerance towards the pro-Erdogan fakes of the Twitter administrators, in the conditions that Elon Musk complied with the summons of the Ankara authorities to censor several accounts of the Opposition. The billionaire was accused that, although he declares himself a promoter of freedom of expression, he is only an opportunist interested in business relations with the current president's regime. As for the authors of the forgeries, Kemal Kilicdaroglu directly accused Russia of being behind a disinformation campaign aimed at keeping Erdogan in power. The Kremlin categorically denied any involvement in the elections in Turkey.
Russian propagandists want the extermination of the majority of Ukrainians
dzen.ru / May 11, censor.net / May 12, 2023
Fired last year from Russia Today after he suggested drowning Ukrainian children in a broadcast, propagandist Anton Krasovski recently resumed his ultra-radical campaign against Ukrainians on a media platform called Conservator TV. In an April editorial, he justified the monstrosity of the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier by Russian soldiers as part of the excesses inherent in war. A new proof of the fascist, criminal ideas of the Kremlin propagandists came in a recording from May 11, this time not from Krasovski, but from his guest, the rapper Akim Apaciov - an ethnic Russian born in Ukraine, in Mariupol .
 A.K.: Are we at war with Ukraine or with the Ukrainians?
A.A.: We are at war against an idea. We are not at war with Ukraine or the Ukrainian people.
A.K.: But the Ukrainians fight against us?
AA: Yes. The bearers of this idea, yes. We must destroy them, kill all the bearers of the Ukrainian national idea.
A.K.: Are they the majority in Ukraine at this moment?
A.A.: The bearers of this idea, yes. But they became the majority not because they have any merit, but because we did nothing in terms of ideology. (...) War is a natural process. The war is necessary, it is important. The war itself is not a goal, it is a means, a way to development. Any civilization must periodically go through wars to survive.

NEWS: Moldova recalled its representative to the Secretariat of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly Council, Ion Lipciu, back in February. It was rushed by Europe. The head of the EU Delegation, Janis Mazeiks, declared that CIS agreements are not compatible with Chisinau's obligations to the EU.
[...] After Maia Sandu came to power, the country's representatives stopped participating in the Community summits, but did not allow themselves to make radical statements. But after Moldova (as a trailer for Ukraine) received the status of a candidate for EU accession, the processes began to accelerate. This year, the country's state budget does not provide funds for the payment of CIS membership fees.
[...] The CIS countries represent over 13% of the trade of the Republic of Moldova. The country imported at low prices from the CIS 74.3% of fertilizers, 65.4% of lumber, 51.8% of mineral products, 48.2% of metals, and until recently, 100% of cheap gas and electricity.
At the same time, Moldova exports to the CIS 59% of fruits and nuts, 92% of all pharmaceutical products. 163,000 Moldovans work in Russia alone, who in 2021 transferred 200 million dollars to Moldova.
According to opinion polls, approximately 70% of Moldovans oppose the breaking of economic, diplomatic and cultural ties with Russia. At the same time, 55% consider the exit of the republic from the CIS as wrong. NARRATIVES: 1. The EU forced Chisinau to leave the CIS. 2. The majority of the population opposes leaving the CIS, which is a vital economic partner for the Republic of Moldova
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The President of the Chisinau Parliament, Igor Grosu, announced on May 15 the initiation of the procedure for the withdrawal of the Republic of Moldova from the Agreement on the Interparliamentary Assembly of the Community of Independent States (CIS AP). ""Being in the CIS did not protect us from energy blackmail in the dead of winter, threats and official statements hostile to the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova. Being in the CIS did not protect the member countries from military attacks, war and the illegal occupation of sovereign territories. After a founding country of the CIS, the Russian Federation, barbarically attacked another founding state, Ukraine, occupying its territories and killing its citizens, this organization can no longer be called a Community"", he explained the decision of the authorities from Chisinau.
The CIS was established in 1991 against the background of the breakup of the former USSR and was always seen as the organization through which Moscow tried to maintain its sphere of influence in the ex-Soviet states. The Baltic countries did not join the organization, and Georgia left it in 2008, after the Russian invasion. Even Ukraine is no longer, de facto, a member of the CIS, even if it has not completed the withdrawal procedures from this organization.
The Chisinau authorities announced earlier that they will examine the opportunity to denounce some agreements within the CIS that do not offer benefits to the Republic of Moldova. Recently, the Parliament denounced the agreement regarding the participation of the Republic of Moldova in the activity of the CIS radio and TV company ""MIR"".
Over the years, Russia imposed several restrictions on Moldovan products, especially after 2013, when the Republic of Moldova signed the Association Agreement with the EU, decisions that were commented on in Chisinau as political, intended to prevent the country's approach to The European community.
In 2022, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine obtained the status of candidates for EU accession. After the victory of the pro-European forces in Chisinau (2020-2021), but especially after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, relations between Chisinau and Moscow deteriorated. The Moldovan authorities condemned the Russian military aggression, even if they did not adhere to the international sanctions imposed on Russia.
OBJECTIVE: To present the government from Chisinau as being subordinate to the West and, respectively, its decisions as being taken against the Russian Federation. To appreciate the economic and commercial dependence of the Republic of Moldova on the CIS.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: There is no evidence that the West forced the Republic of Moldova to leave the CIS. The head of the EU delegation has repeatedly stated that this situation will be examined in the future, after the start of the accession negotiations, so that currently there is no question of the Republic of Moldova's membership in the CIS. ""In the past, we did not have such situations, because all the states that joined the EU were not members of the CIS. I don't think it's a problem that needs to be addressed urgently. These will be things that will be examined at the stage of negotiations,"" Mazeiks declared in December 2022 on Radio Moldova.
The statement that this year the Government of the Republic of Moldova did not provide financial resources for membership quotas in CIS organizations is also false. In fact, approximately 9 million lei (450 thousand euros) were allocated from the budget for this, the largest part of the amount (almost 300 thousand euros) being intended for the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly.
It is not clear which survey the publication is referring to when it states that 55% of Moldovans are against withdrawing from the CIS. The last sociological research, carried out by the company iData, shows that 41.2% of the respondents spoke against the withdrawal from the CIS, and 40.6% opted in favor of such a decision.
The article focuses on several categories of products that are mainly exported to the CIS states, but they represent a fraction of the total Moldovan exports. Statistical data reveals that in 2022, without Ukraine, the share of exports to the CIS was approximately 7% of the total, i.e. four times lower than that of exports to Romania.
Finally, withdrawing from the Agreement on participation in the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS does not mean denouncing the Free Trade Agreement, so it does not prevent the maintenance and development of commercial relations between the Republic of Moldova and the CIS in the future.

Russian press: Zelensky is the servant of the West who wants to destroy Russia at any cost
NEWS: ""For the current [Ukrainian] deputies, most of whom will probably not be elected to the Parliament no matter what happens, the extension of martial law is convenient - they will continue to live well from public money.
Zelenski's visit to Europe, outside of Ukraine, had as its main purpose to confirm in the eyes of his patrons in the collective West his status as a unique and incomparable leader and - most importantly - a president who cannot be changed in his state. He will use his country and people to achieve all the wishes of the West. The main goal is the war directed against Russia to weaken and exhaust it. In fact, there is more and more talk about Zelensky's decision to fight this war to the last Ukrainian. Due to this personal decision, he wants to obtain another ""princely certificate"", issued at the moment by Washington.
[...] Zelenski understands very well that he is needed now, as long as he is in power. If he will no longer lead Ukraine or will be defeated in the war, he will be thrown into the dustbin of history, somewhere in exile, or in the worst case - in the cemetery. The West, which commissioned this show, must accept the new reality"".
NARRATIVE: The war in Ukraine is in the interest of Zelenski and the West, which wants to destroy Russia.
Reality: Russia is the one who started the war, and Ukraine is forced to defend itself
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media resumes a false narrative about Ukrainian political leaders as ""servants"" of the West in the context of President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to a series of European capitals. Russian propaganda shows that the leaders of Ukraine will go to war to make money and stay in power, this being one of the conditions of the West.
In reality, the losses of society, of the Ukrainian political and economic elite following the war are enormous. The infrastructure is destroyed, the state's debts are increasing, and most of the social expenses depend on foreign loans. The economic potential of the state is less and less. Large factories, refineries, enterprises were destroyed or seriously affected, a number of economic fields stopped their activity.
According to estimates, the destruction in Ukraine caused by the Russian bombing exceeded 144 billion dollars a year after the war. The cost of the unprovoked invasion of Russia is enormous and cannot in any way be in the interest of the government in Kiev, which is trying to maintain control over the critical situation in the country. In the last year, the level of poverty in Ukraine increased from 5.5% to 24.2%. More than 7 million people are below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.
At the same time, the accusations against the West that they want to destroy Russia with the hands of the Ukrainians are unfounded. Around the invasion of Ukraine by Moscow, there were a series of meetings between Western and Russian leaders to avoid armed aggression. There followed requests from the presidents of the USA, France, Great Britain and other countries to Russia for the withdrawal of Moscow's troops from near the border with Ukraine.
On February 24, 2022, Moscow launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the West decided to support the defensive efforts of Kiev, which declared general mobilization. The aggression of the Russian army was condemned by most of the states of the world and by the most important international organizations. According to the rules of international law, especially the UN Charter, every state has an inherent right to defend itself, which Kiev has been doing for about 15 months.
Zelenski's visit to the European states was not aimed at demonstrating political loyalty to the West, which would have totally controlled him and would have wanted the destruction of Russia. The purpose of the visit was to strengthen the support of the main allies against the Russian invasion in the context of the preparation of a Ukrainian counter-offensive, which requires more and more modern equipment and weapons. At the summit of the Council of Europe, Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine needs fighter jets and anti-aircraft defense equipment. The Ukrainian leader asked his Western allies to send him fighter jets that would allow the Ukrainian army to strike deep into the Russian troops and successfully organize the counteroffensive delayed due to the prolongation of the fighting for Bahmut, but also the delayed supply of some types of weaponry by the West.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. According to the Russian press, the USA will send 200 thousand Ukrainian suicide bombers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, to the offensive. Russian propaganda tries to convince public opinion that the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the EU has sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are freed from Russia. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""Only 15% of the world's population condemns Russia for the aggression against Ukraine.

Condemnations were extended with the large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The European Union, the USA and other countries introduced sanctions against Russia in connection with the violation of international law. At this moment, the war in Ukraine is certainly the biggest concern of world politics, its economic implications far exceeding the borders of a regional conflict.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the anti-Western discourse and amplifying Russian feelings.
Whoever is not against us, is with us
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Since the beginning of the war, the UN General Assembly has voted four special resolutions regarding several aspects: the withdrawal of Russian military forces from Ukraine; the humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine; the suspension of Russia from the UN Human Rights Council; condemning Russia for its decision to annex parts of Ukraine. A simple analysis of the votes of each state shows us its position regarding the war in Ukraine. Thus, we observe that only three states (Belarus, Syria and North Korea) fully support the aggression unleashed by Moscow, while 102 of the total of 193 states with the right to vote fully support the Ukrainian cause. The rest of the countries abstained from voting or supported only part of the four resolutions. As far as India and China are concerned, although the two countries have not joined the Western call to impose economic sanctions on Russia, their official position is one of neutrality. In addition, it is obvious that not all the population of these countries share the same point of view, just as, despite the fact that Romania has officially announced, countless times, its total support for Ukraine, there are enough Romanians who have positioned themselves on the Russian side. If we refer strictly to the graph taken by the author of the material, we easily notice that, in fact, the vast majority of states and the population, approximately 80%, adopted a neutral position, Russia actually having a little over 5% support among the world population, including here its inhabitants.
The same results of the vote within the UN assemblies, as well as the positions taken by the leaders of several countries, show us that Ukraine is not only supported by the rich West, but also by countries such as Moldova, Albania, Chad, Somalia, Liberia, Zambia, etc. ., whose economic situation is not one of the happiest. At the same time, it is obvious that in addition to the humanitarian interest, there is also a part of the political-economic chest with economic interests in Ukraine, but this does not imply the exploitation of the country and the impoverishment of the population. Basically, Russia's interests in Ukraine are also of an economic nature, with the difference that they do not take into account the humanitarian side, human rights and democratic governance.
The statement that more and more countries are positioning themselves on Russia's side is only an exaggeration, which has as its starting point the analysis from the original article in which it is stated that ""According to data from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), several countries, including Colombia, Turkey and Qatar, which were previously aligned with the West, entered the neutral category, as their governments seek to obtain economic benefits from the relationship with both sides."" By no means are the above-mentioned countries ""about to move into the camp other"". The transition from the position of support for Ukraine to one of neutrality is indeed observed in some states, but this is explained by a ""fatigue"" of the international community towards this issue. The number of those who firmly support Ukraine's positions within The UN is in slight decline, but the numbers depend primarily on the content of the resolutions.The tougher they became towards Russia, the more states took a neutral position.

May 9 - from the defense of the homeland to the glorification of aggression
news.sky.com / May 10, 2023; en.kremlin.ru / May 9, 2023; ru.usembassy.gov
The only battle tank that marched in the Victory Day parade in Moscow was a T-34, the main armored vehicle used by the former Soviet Union in the Second World War. It is not the only proof of the austerity that marked the ceremony. From the device that marched in front of the official tribune, the only operative units of the regular forces were the railway contingents and the military police. Many observers see in the poor presence of armored vehicles and troops at the Red Square parade a sign of the imminent military failure of the so-called ""special operations"", in the conditions in which Russia surrendered a large part of the territories occupied a year ago and lost over half of the number of tanks assigned to the intervention. However, the British Ministry of Defense considers that, despite the considerable damage, Russia had enough resources to show off, but the Kremlin could not be accused internally of putting the grandeur of the celebration above the operations on the front. Even without the grandeur of other years, the ""Victory Day"" parade did not lack propagandistic messages. Besides repeating the false or absurd theories of the West's war against Russia, the fight against Ukrainian Nazism and resistance to the decadence of the West, in a rare concession made to historical reality, President Putin acknowledged, in passing, the contribution of other states to the defeat of Nazism in 1945 .
Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation:
""We bow to the members of the Resistance who bravely faced Nazism, as well as to the allied armies of the United States, Great Britain and other countries. We do not forget to pay tribute to the heroism of the Chinese soldiers in the fight against Japanese militarism. I firmly believe that the experience of solidarity and partnership over the years of fighting against a common threat represents a priceless legacy.""
By referring to the former solidarity against Nazism, Putin insinuates that the Western countries should today be on Moscow's side in the conflict with Kiev. Fake! Consistently, most of the world's states condemn the unprovoked armed aggression of a sovereign state, as they did in the Second World War. Today's aggressor is Russia, which justifies itself by invoking concepts taken over and adapted from Hitler's rhetoric, such as guaranteeing its security through a so-called ""vital space"" around the borders or the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians from invented persecution. avoids talking about the constant political and financial support that the Kremlin has given to far-right, neo-fascist or ultra-conservative parties from France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Great Britain, to Brazil and the United States. The relationship of the Russian authorities with their own citizens reminds and German National Socialism, if we consider the numerous cases of humiliation, intimidation, even physical liquidation of opponents, as well as the suppression of the free press and the de facto establishment of censorship. As for the lack of anti-Nazi ""solidarity"" lamented by Well, it exists. The Western support given to Ukraine is similar to that which the Soviet Union received from the United States after it was invaded by Hitler's army. In March 1941, before America entered the war, President Roosevelt promulgated the Lend and Lease Act, which ordered the supply of weapons, supplies and raw materials to the allied nations against Germany and Japan. Based on this law, the Soviet Union received, until September 1945, aid worth 11.3 billion dollars, the equivalent of more than 160 billion today. During the conflagration, the Soviets received, in addition to oil, explosives and food, over 400,000 jeeps and trucks, 14,000 planes, 8,000 tractors and 13,000 tanks. Some of these participated in the first Victory Day parade, led in 1945 in Red Square by Marshal Gheorghi Zhukov, who - according to KGB documents - recognized the decisive importance of Western support for the Red Army. A support that Vladimir Putin forgets to mention every year in his May 9 speech.
European protests orchestrated by Russian secret agents
dw.com / May 8, 2023; expressen.se / May 8, 2023
The Russian secret services infiltrated or organized demonstrations in several large European cities for propaganda purposes. It is the conclusion of a joint investigation in which eight Western publications and television stations from Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark and Norway participated. The journalists rely on several confidential strategic documents from within the Kremlin's security apparatus via the Dossier Centre, an organization led by the exiled oppositionist Mihail Khodorkovsky. According to the documents, the directed protests have as objectives, among others, the creation of an anti-Ukrainian feeling and the obstruction of Sweden's admission to NATO. Some of the simulated protest actions at the Kremlin's recommendation have already taken place. Thus, agents of Moscow who claimed to be Ukrainians would have demonstrated against Turkey in order to leave the impression of a massive anti-Islamic attitude in Europe. Examples include a demonstration that took place in Paris at the beginning of March, where fake members of the Ukrainian community protested with hoods against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, using the Hitler salute and mocking the victims of the earthquake that devastated Turkey in February and Syria. The investigation also revealed that the provocateurs infiltrated the participants in the protests on various topics, such as health care, pension reform and climate change, trying to divert them into actions against supporting Ukraine in the war. The photos of the fake protesters thus became propaganda materials distributed on the Internet as an illustration of the size of the alleged anti-Ukrainian European current.
""Counter Strike"" penetrates the censorship of the Russian media
klse.i3investor.com / May 7, 2023;
A Finnish publication found a way to circumvent the restrictions imposed in Russia on the independent press. Helsingin Sonomat distributes the censored news from the Ukrainian front by ingeniously disguising it in the computer game Counter Strike: Global Offensive, which - with over four million fans - is the most popular among young Russian gamers. The game offers users the opportunity to create their own maps, in addition to the dozens of predefined levels and routes, which are then available to all players. Using this portal, journalists upload real information about the atrocities of the war and the real causes of the invasion of Ukraine. They created a virtual Slavic city called ""Voina"", which means ""War"", in which Russian language reports are stored in a secret room. On one of the walls of the digital camera there is a map of Ukraine with information about attacks on civilians. The initiative of the Finnish newspaper, which was revealed on the occasion of the International Day of Freedom of the Press, also surprised the creators of the game, who appreciated the creativity of the journalists.

The false narrative aims to divert attention from the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children by Russia.
Propaganda: Children from Ukrainian orphanages are sold in European countries
NEWS: ""Children from Ukrainian orphanages are sold in Europe to obtain large profits,"" Polish human rights activist Joanna Pachwicewicz told Izvestia. She emphasized that she has been dealing with this topic for many years. From the very beginning of the special operation for the defense of Donbass, she already knew that such situations would occur more and more often.
Last year, in June, I obtained a series of documents about the sale of all the children from an orphanage located not far from Mariupol. This orphanage was sold to Spain. I mean 85 children from the orphanage, said Pachwicewicz.
According to the human rights activist, this is additional proof of the increase in the trafficking of minors in the European region. She also explained that in Europe and Great Britain a special legal system was developed that allows the state to take a minor from a family under the guise of the principle of protecting children's rights. We are talking about juvenile justice, emphasized Pachwicewicz.
[...] Citizens of Great Britain urged their government to carefully check the biographies of Ukrainian refugees after a series of thefts and frauds. Victims of scams create online communities where they share their stories. But, at the same time, the members of such groups do not deny that many Ukrainians need support. European countries have started hosting Ukrainian refugees on their territories since the beginning of the special Russian operation launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 with the aim of protecting the inhabitants of Donbass.
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian children are sold to the West while Russia defends the inhabitants of Donbass
Reality: Russia kidnapped and deported Ukrainian children, which could be qualified as a crime against humanity
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Most of the news published in the pro-Kremlin press is based on the statement of the Polish human rights activist Joanna Pachwicewicz, who allegedly saw in June 2022 a series of documents about the trafficking of Ukrainian children in Europe. None of the sources publish these documents, there is no proof or confirmation of this information.
All the false narratives are built around a statement, an opinion, of the Polish activist who spoke to the Moscow press in Russian. Joanna Pachwicewicz was often invited by the Russian government press to various shows, having a rich history of collaboration with the Sputnik agency, banned for propaganda on the territory of the Western states. In the interview given to the pro-Kremlin newspaper ""Izvestia"", she talked about some documents that she would have seen once, but no longer has, and mentioned the juvenile justice system in Great Britain. The interview published as text and video was set up in such a way that it appears that the police in European countries take Ukrainian children from their refugee parents from Ukraine and sell them.
In order to give more credibility to this false narrative, some media outlets quoted former Ukrainian Prime Minister refugee in Russia, Nikolai Azarov, who shared the news on his Telegram channel. In some pro-Kremlin publications, news appeared about the opinion of the former head of the government from Kiev about what Ukraine is doing with children, in other situations the points of view of some Russian experts were requested, who ""confirmed"" that the trafficking of Ukrainian minors is a cruel reality. Without any evidence, the false narrative created an entire current of opinion on the territory of Russia with the help of dozens of downloads, quotes and distributions on social networks.
The appearance of this false narrative is not accidental, since in April this year 49 UN and EU member states condemned Russia for abusing the rights and privileges of a permanent member of the Security Council to spread disinformation about the ""generalized abductions of thousands of Ukrainian children"". The signatories emphasize that any disinformation would spread Russia, it will not be able to deny the truth or protect people from responsibility for their crimes. In early May of this year, the OSCE published a report, according to which a large number of Ukrainian children were deported to Russia and its occupied territories. The OSCE mentions that Russia has violated the rights of Ukrainian children illegally taken to Russian territory, which could at some point be categorized as crimes against humanity. According to human rights organizations in Ukraine, the Russian military has deported more than 730,000 Ukrainian children to be ,, reeducate in the spirit of the Russian world"".
The false narrative distributed by the Russian media was aimed at exonerating Russia and justifying its ""military operation"" on the territory of Ukraine, explained as an urgent need to defend the inhabitants of Donbass. The deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia is shown as a measure of protecting them from possible kidnapping or human trafficking in Europe.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the war in Ukraine. According to the Russian media, the losses of the Ukrainian army are so high that students are forced to donate blood for the military, while the leadership of Ukraine wants war to make money and does not care about the suffering of civilians. According to Russian propaganda, only Russian speakers from the east are mobilized in the army because they want to exterminate them, and Kiev gives money to those who trick their friends into enlisting.

The thesis of starting a war in Transnistria is one of the most frequently used by (pro) Russian propaganda with the aim of scaring the population of the Republic of Moldova and undermining the country's pro-Western policy.
NEWS: ""A source told RT [Russia Today] that the Armed Forces of Ukraine massed thousands of soldiers in the Odesa region to prepare a challenge against Transnistria.
It is reported that since the beginning of March, in the region of Dachnoe, Kamenka and Razdelnaya localities, the local authorities have started handing over hangars to the Ukrainian troops to house personnel and equipment.
In April, almost 4,000 soldiers were sent there who settled in those hangars and change their location 2-3 times a day.
From May 9 to 15, a group of the Ukrainian Military Forces plans to head towards Tiraspol to launch a military challenge with the aim of distracting the Russian military forces, and the second will try to take over the ammunition depots from Cobasna"" (Russia today)
""Chisinau and Kiev agreed to liquidate Transnistria and persecute the Russian population in the region. Military political scientist, director of the charitable institution Law and Order, reserve lieutenant colonel Oleg Ivannikov told ura.ru about this.
[...]
According to him, Leopard tanks could be used against the inhabitants of Transnistria. ""I would like to remind you that approximately 500,000 people live there, of which 250,000 are Russian citizens. So, a real terror will begin. Challenges are quite possible. The Leopard tanks, which were observed in Odesa, will definitely be used in case of an attack on Transnistria"", said the lieutenant-colonel"" (ura.news)
NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova plan to attack the (peaceful) Transnistrian region. 2. Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova are led by Russophobic regimes that will suppress the Russian-speaking population in the Transnistrian region.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Russian Ministry of Defense launched accusations, at the end of February, that the Ukrainian army had intensified its preparations for an invasion of Transnistria. In addition, Russian propaganda systematically presents Ukraine as being governed by a warlike regime, the authorities in Chisinau as being totally subordinate to the West and ready to carry out its orders, including getting involved in the war in Ukraine and joining the North Atlantic Alliance.
OBJECTIVE: Since the general intention of these narratives is to demonize Ukraine and the West, in the case of the Republic of Moldova, a specific objective is to feed the phobias of the population of the pro-Russian separatist region, led by a Moscow-friendly regime, against a NATO ""invasion"" and a subsequent westernization of the country and/or even the union with Romania. The same narrative is intended for the national minorities in the Republic of Moldova, generally speaking Russian, such as including the Gagauzians, but also for a good part of the Romanian-speaking population, but nostalgic for former USSR and/or attached and educated in the spirit of culture and demagoguery.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Officials from Kiev have declared since the beginning of the war that they could intervene in Transnistria to annihilate the Russian separatist regime, but they have stated on several occasions that they will not take any action in Transnistria without the agreement of the Republic of Moldova. Chisinau ruled out every time a scenario that would involve the settlement of the conflict by military means and reiterated that it only examines solutions to settle the conflict by peaceful means.
In the Republic of Moldova, the Russian-speaking minority, which represents approximately 20% of the population, enjoys wide rights, including educational institutions, the translation of official documents, and the Gagauz people in the South of the country have their own autonomous region, with legislative and executive. The Constitution of the Republic of Moldova establishes that ""the state recognizes and protects the right to preserve, develop and function the Russian language and other languages ​​spoken on the territory of the country"".
Chisinau opts for the settlement of the Transnistrian conflict by granting a special status to Transnistria, similar to the one that Gagauzia has.
It should be noted that, two days after the date on which, according to Russia Today, the Moldovan-Ukrainian operation should have been launched, no movement of troops towards Transnistria could be observed. Publication / Media:

The false narratives were promoted at the demonstration of the extremist AUR party on May 6, but also at the protest on May 10.
NEWS: In the mobilization campaign for the May 6 demonstration, during it and at the Parliament protest on May 10, AUR promoted a series of messages regarding the sale of Romania and its children. Veridica selected some of these messages, as they appeared on the AUR official page, on the flyers announcing the May 6 demonstration and in the statements made by the AUR leader, George Simion, during it:
""WE ARE NOT SELLING OUR COUNTRY! For the children of Romania, for the forests, for Hidroelectrica, Salrom and all the others they want to steal from us.""
""The situation in which the Romanian society was brought by the government of the traitors led by Nicolae Ciuca, as well as the last anti-national and anti-family actions promoted by them, obliges us to take a stance in the STREET! Thus, on MAY 6 - 4 p.m., all Romanians of good faith will mobilize to make the voice of the people heard and to protest in front of the Parliament Palace (Izvor).""
""On May 6, we are protesting against the anti-national and anti-family laws that the governing coalition wants to promote. The more we are, the more we can stop projects such as Pl-x 145, Pl-x 144, Pl-x 143, Pl-x 47!""
""All these poisonous, dangerous laws are coming to the Chamber of Deputies, which will privatize and force all state utilities - Hidroelectrica, Salrom, Romsilva - to be listed on the stock market. Well, why should they be listed on the stock market, what investment do we need at Romsilva or Hidroelectrica? All these harmful projects derive from the implementation of the harmful PNRR.""
""Many will try to denigrate us, make files on us. We are not selling our country, this is the message. If we didn't have social networks, we would already be arrested"" NARRATIVES: 1. Romanian children will be taken from their families and made available to the world occult. 2. State companies in key economic fields will be sold to Western corporations. 3. Romanians will no longer be able to move freely, being forced to live in a restricted area, imposed by occult forces. 4. Patriots are in danger of being arrested, and freedom of speech suppressed by the new measures prepared by the globalist world elite.
CONTEXT: The first years of post-December Romanian democracy were marked by two decisive slogans for the path taken by Romanian society towards the market economy. ""We don't sell our country"" and ""We work, we don't think"" are the ideas, which several voices claim were born in the offices of the former Security, around which the economic modernization of the country was stopped, and a series of former securists and politicians looted Romania's economy in the 90s. In the 33 years since the revolution, the two slogans have antagonized Romanian society, leading to the (re)birth of extremist nationalist movements, supporters of an extremely toxic primitive type of patriotism, which contests Romania's accession to the Euro-Atlantic community and the organizations that governs the Western world, especially the European Union and NATO. The ideology of these movements revolves around several narratives, starting from a mystical exaggeration of the role played by the Romanian people in the history of mankind, up to conspiracy theses fueled by disinformation and fake news. Many of these have their origins in Russian propaganda, on the one hand serving Moscow's interest to present itself in opposition to a decadent, immoral and rapacious West (for its own image), but also to undermine Western values ​​(which represent the main threat to the Putin regime, obsessed with keeping such values ​​away from Russians) and democratic countries, which it regards as geopolitical adversaries. At the same time, they also represent a reality of political life in most liberal democracies, where they have been taken over by different groups (populists or extremists on both sides of the political spectrum), so-called opinion makers or influencers, as well as a certain gender media (especially online) etc.
With the Covid19 pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the Romanian media space was invaded by false Eurosceptic and anti-NATO narratives, many of which have already been dismantled in the Veridica pages, such as the desire of Romanians to leave the EU and NATO, because the European Union plans poisoning the population, assassinating patriots and dragging the country into war. The bills currently under parliamentary debate were the pretext for a protest by the members and sympathizers of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, officially directed against the bad governance of Bucharest, but transformed into one full of absurd claims, based on these fake news and manipulations rude things rolled in the public space by the party leaders.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the authorities and the entire political class, demonizing the West, promoting the sovereignist, anti-Western discourse, as well as increasing one's own notoriety through self-victimization, for electoral purposes.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The four laws that AUR claims would contribute to the loss of Romania's assets and sovereignty are nothing more than normative acts aimed at modernizing and updating the way the state operates, in order to make several areas of activity more efficient. Thus, PL-x 145/2023 is a draft law that establishes several rules for preventing the separation of children from their families, the result of several economic, social or educational causes. The government is the initiator of the project, and its purpose is to help raise children, not to take them from their families. The law seeks to draw up a service plan to benefit families in vulnerable situations (poverty, lack of social assistance, poor education, insufficient living space, etc.), through which they will be improved, putting the immediate needs of the child in the foreground . At the same time, this normative act establishes the National Children's Office, an IT module within the National Authority for the Protection of Children's Rights and Adoption, which AUR claims is a first step through which the state will monitor Romanian children for their subsequent adoption from families. In fact, the Children's Office is a database in which records of children at risk of being separated from their families will be kept. In principle, this database already exists at the local level, it will be centralized and improved at the country level. In the past, a similar narrative was promoted by the independent senator Diana Sosoaca, who claimed that Western occult forces will take the children of Romanian families, as a result of the approval of a draft law that regulates, among other things, the form and content of identity documents.
PL-x 143 is actually a normative act that seeks to improve the way in which companies with majority state capital are managed, by implementing some principles of corporate governance of state enterprises. It regulates, among other things, the status of various state institutions with a determining role in the activity of these companies, in the sense of increasing their economic performance and profitability, which must be similar to the management of private companies in the same fields of activity. At the same time, it establishes a series of prohibitions for dignitaries (parliamentarians, members of the government, mayors, etc.) to occupy management positions within state companies and establishes the Agency for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Performance of Public Enterprises, an institution subordinate to the Government, which has the role of establishing the management policy of the state companies, of following the implementation of the established rules and of monitoring, evaluating, respectively sanctioning the manner of their application. Related to the sale of several companies in key fields of activity, the law introduces a separate chapter (V1) that only regulates the ways in which the state's participation in these public enterprises can be reduced, but this obviously does not assume that this will happen in inevitably. What the AUR leaders forget or do not say is that, in the same chapter, the law also regulates the ways in which the state can increase its participation in companies with majority state capital, including by purchasing shares on the capital market. In the end, a possible listing on the stock exchange of some minority stakes or the privatization of some majority stakes in state companies, would lead to capitalization, modernization and an increase in economic performance. Last but not least, the presence among the shareholders of private entities would certainly lead to an increase in transparency and possible denunciations of irregularities within these companies. As in the previous case, this narrative was also rolled out in the public space by Diana Sosoaca, who warned in the fall of 2022 that Hidroelectrica, like other Romanian assets, will be taken over by foreigners.
Pl-x 47 is a legislative project regarding sustainable urban mobility and does nothing but align Romanian legislation with the entire set of European normative acts in the field. In addition, the entry into force of the legislation on sustainable urban mobility is a milestone foreseen in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, committed at the governmental level by Romania. AUR claims that the project would lead to the transformation of cities into prisons, a narrative that is part of the spectrum of climate denialism, about which Veridica warned more than a year ago. The implementation of the urban concept of ""15-minute city"" does not in any way imply the elimination of Romanians' freedom of movement, but brings more benefits, from more free time to health, cleaner air, quality green space and stronger links with the community. For example, an area adapted to this concept becomes a much more favorable environment for the development of small local businesses that the AUR patriots urge us to support.
Finally, Pl-x 144 adds and modifies certain articles of the law on bailiffs, introducing new provisions regarding their powers, rights and obligations. Without an obvious connection with the ""sale of Romania"", the respective legislative project was included in the list of those contested by the nationalist opposition, probably out of inertia, without knowing its content. What remains unclear at the end of this protest is the contradiction between the previous positions taken by the leaders AUR, who accused all the post-December governments of having (already!) sold the country to foreigners and the commitment made last weekend, to refuse its sale in the future.

In reality, Russia is the aggressor , and the ""special military operation"" is an invasion condemned by most of the world's states.
Propaganda: Russia defends itself against the war orchestrated by the West against it
NEWS: ""A real war has been orchestrated against our Motherland, but we will ensure our security,"" said the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, at the May 9 Victory Parade.
Western elites talk about their exclusivism, pit nations against each other, divide societies, provoke bloody conflicts, sow Russophobia and aggressive nationalism, the head of state emphasized.
According to him, the West provokes conflicts and coups, destroys traditional values ​​in order to impose its rules, which are, in fact, a system of theft and violence.
Everyone sees how in a series of states without mercy and emotion the memorials of Soviet soldiers are destroyed, the cult of Nazis and their collaborators is created, and the memory of true heroes is erased, the Russian leader emphasized.
""They want the results of the Second World War to be forgotten, to destroy all the sovereign centers of development"", declared Putin. The state is proud of the participants of the Special Military Operation on which the future of our people depends, the president added.
NARRATIVE: ""The special military operation"" saves Russia from Western aggression
Reality: The West is helping Ukraine to defend itself against Russia's armed aggression
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The West does not aim to wipe Russia off the face of the earth and it cannot be about any military aggression directed against Moscow. On February 24, 2022, Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the West is supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. The aggression of the Russian army was condemned by most of the states of the world and by the most important international organizations. According to the rules of international law, especially the UN Charter, every state has an inherent right to defend itself, which Kiev has been doing for about 15 months.
The West is not a direct part of the conflict and did not initiate the war. In order to manipulate public opinion, Russian propaganda replaces cause with consequence in media narratives and politicians' speeches. Vladimir Putin presents the ""special military operation"" as an action to save Russia, compared to the heroism of the Soviet soldiers who freed the world from Nazism. In reality, the West's support for Ukraine is a consequence of the ""special military operation"", and the deliveries of weapons and ammunition took place especially after its launch, intensifying during the last months.
As in the case of other false narratives of the last months regarding the war in Ukraine, the cause - the invasion of the Ukrainian state by Russia - is presented in a deliberately false way as a consequence of the arms deliveries. After attacking Ukraine, Russia was designated a terrorist state first by the European Parliament and then by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the International Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin in March.
At the Victory Parade in Moscow, Vladimir Putin compared the ""special military operation"" to the war for the defense of the homeland from 1941-1945 in order to encourage the mobilization of society and justify military actions on the territory of Ukraine. Russia is described as a victim of Western aggression This conflict acquires symbolic values ​​by comparing the Soviet-German war - called in the ex-Soviet space ""The Great War for the Defense of the Fatherland"" - with the Russian-Western one. This message aims to strengthen trust in the authorities, deepening the image of Russia as a fortress besieged by ""evil forces"".
Regarding the history of the Second World War, Vladimir Putin continues the propaganda messages from the time of the Soviet regime when it was forbidden to talk about the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of 1939 for the division of Europe. Soviet historiography presented Moscow as a victim of Nazi Germany's attack, and not as an accomplice and an aggressor who, together with Germany, started the war in Europe. According to the dominant narratives in Russia, the West does not want to be grateful to Russia as the heir of the Soviet Union for the heroism of the past, neglecting the enormous support from the USA and Great Britain, without which the victory over Nazism would have been impossible. It is worth mentioning that a resolution of the European Parliament from 2019 emphasizes that the Second World War was started as a result of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression and cooperation pact of August 23, 1939, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media that built the myth of Russia as a besieged fortress. The Russian press wrote that Ukraine is a pseudo-Nazi state pushed to war by the West, and the US allowed Ukraine to bomb Russia. According to Russian propaganda, Moscow must mobilize to defeat NATO in the new ""war for the defense of the homeland"", while in Ukraine the mothers and wives of Ukrainian soldiers killed in the battles are protesting against the war.

The Kremlin's propaganda took May 1 off
theguardian.com / 2 May. 2023; reuters.com / May 3 and 4, 2023; meduza.io / May 2, 2023;
May is traditionally a month of great popular holidays in Russia. The Labor Day parade is followed on May 9 by the grandiose military parade dedicated to the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. And also every May 9, another special moment: the procession of the so-called Immortal Regiment, in which citizens from all over the country march carrying photos of relatives lost in the Second World War. This year, the evolution of the fighting in Ukraine has led the authorities to radically adjust the program of demonstrations: the largest trade union in Russia has given up on the demonstrations planned for May 1, the processions of the Immortal Regiment will only take place online, and the Victory Day festivities in at least six regions were cancelled. In Moscow, where the general public will not have access to the spectacular military parade, traffic in Red Square has been closed since April 27, two weeks before the event. The reason cited by the authorities is the same in all cases: the risk of terrorist actions by alleged pro-Ukrainian saboteurs. In fact, the Kremlin announced on May 3 that it had thwarted a drone attack that would have targeted the president of the Federation. The next day, Putin's spokesman claims that the United States is behind an assassination attempt, an accusation categorically denied by Washington. Security experts believe that the alleged attack would be nothing more than a staging directed by Russian propagandists, as it is practically impossible for drones to penetrate the capital's air defense system. Some analysts believe that the real cause of the ban on public gatherings is not so much concern for the safety of the citizens or Putin, as the paranoid obsession of the president to block any critical expressions towards the invasion of Ukraine, however improbable they may be. In fact, despite the restrictions on May 1st demonstrations, there were riotous gatherings across Russia where anti-war placards were displayed. In Saint Petersburg, a 76-year-old man was arrested because he had a cardboard with the traditional slogan ""Peace, Work, May"" to which he had added the letter ""Z"" - the graphic symbol of war - crossed out in red. In Yekaterinburg, a woman was detained for displaying another traditional message - ""Peace in Peace"". Another fear evoked by analysts is the humiliating risk for Putin of infiltrating the grieving wives or parents of fallen soldiers in Ukraine among the participants in the procession of the ""Immortal Regiment"". On the other hand, Russians are growing dissatisfied with the exorbitant costs of military actions, to which are added the substantial sums directed by the Kremlin to the annexed Ukrainian regions. The Russian journalists of the Meduza publication, in exile, revealed on Tuesday a set of instructions drawn up by the presidential administration for Kremlin propagandists. Most of them concern the way in which the government press should present the counteroffensive announced by Kiev. Journalists are also asked to avoid references to the funds allocated to rebuilding the infrastructure in the occupied territories - estimated at over one trillion rubles -, and not to insist on the preparation of the Victory Day parade. The sources cited by Meduza avoided saying what are the real causes of the restrictions, but they made it clear that fewer military vehicles will participate in the Red Square event than last year, given that modern combat techniques are needed on the Ukrainian front .
Patriotism, militarism and propaganda in Putin's Russia
newsinfrance.com/ jun. 2022; aljazeera.com/may 2022
Constrained, paradoxically, by a war of aggression to be able to watch the May 9 military parade only on television, Muscovites or tourists passing through the Russian capital, fans of uniforms, military equipment and the smell of gunpowder, have a convenient alternative at their disposal. for them and their children. Not even 60 kilometers away, in the town of Kubinka, the military-themed park called - how else? is open six days a week. - ""Patriot"". Unofficially, the park is also called ""Putin's military Disneyland"". The President of the Russian Federation has recognized since the inauguration that one of the goals of the 370 million dollar investment spread over 5,500 hectares is the ""military-patriotic education of young people"". It is only a euphemism for the glorification of war and the inoculation of militaristic spirit and attitude belligerence that characterizes the administration from the Kremlin. The most eloquent proof is that, in addition to the military technique used by the Soviets in the face of Hitler's aggression 70 years ago, visitors find on the contemporary exhibits the letter ""Z"" - the symbol of unconditional support for the invasion of Ukraine . And so, an unprovoked war, which has killed more than 100,000 Russians so far, becomes for compatriots - adults and children alike - a pretext for fun and a perverse long-term recruitment strategy. However, things are no longer funny a few hundred meters from Patriot Park, where the Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces stands. The megaconstruction, with a high spire of exactly 19 meters and 45 centimeters - in memory of the year of the end of the last world conflagration - is dedicated to the sacrifice of the soldiers of the Red Army. However, in addition to the huge bas-reliefs and mosaics representing the victorious troops almost 80 years ago, an entire wall is covered with the image of the so-called ""heroes"" of the military interventions in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Syria and the invasion of Crimea in 2014. Praised by Patriarch Kiril, the edifice is not appreciated by all orthodox theologians.
Another objective with historical claims, not to be missed in the plans of Kremlin propagandists, is the exhibition entitled ""NATO: a chronicle of cruelty"", organized at the Museum of Contemporary History in Moscow by the Russian Ministry of Defense shortly after the invasion of Ukraine. The exhibits portray the American soldiers as bloodthirsty warriors. To impress the visitors, the sound background menacingly suggests the approach of bombing planes. The main goal of the exhibition is to present NATO and the United States as aggressors par excellence. The first proof would be the atomic bombs launched on Japan in 1945, followed by the war in Vietnam. The photos are accompanied by explanations regarding the atrocities committed during the military interventions in Serbia, in 1999, or in Afghanistan, in 2001.
In the organizers' opinion, the most convincing objects on display are those presented as having been captured on the battlefield in Ukraine: radio equipment, satellite phones, as well as Western-made anti-tank missiles. Without providing any evidence, the guide claims that NATO supplies military equipment to Ukrainian Nazi organizations. Accompanied by the history teacher, the young students leave the exhibition thinking that the war is the fault of the West and that the Russian army is fighting in Ukraine with NATO countries.
Kremlin journalists on TV propaganda missions
theguardian.com/28 Apr. 2023; russianmediamonitor.com/29 Apr. 2023; twitter.com@MamedovGyunduz/May 1, 2023
Two Russian missiles hit, on the night of April 28, a block of flats in the Ukrainian city of Uman, almost 200 km northeast of Chisinau. According to the Interior Ministry in Kiev, the explosions killed 23 civilians, including six children. The journalists of the state television Russia 1 used the images of the tragedy in the news bulletin, preferring however to divert the significance and the place of production of the event.
Journal Russia April 1 - 29:
 ""Last night, Ukrainian fighters bombed again in Donbas. Nikolsko, Iakovlivka and Iasinuvata were hit more than 20 times. In the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces also attacked the People's Republic of Donetsk, launching almost 260 projectiles.""
Also at Russia 1, another sample of assumed violation of journalistic ethics that shows that, literally, propaganda can kill. A reporter accredited to report from the front turned into a servant of a missile launcher, thus becoming - deliberately - an anti-Ukrainian combatant.
Russia 1 reporter report:
 ""Each rocket launcher charge contains 40 projectiles. We have dozens of loads here. Helping the military is a violation of journalistic ethics whose norms we always respect. But now it is a special situation. I'm sure it's a special case. Until now it was not possible, but now it has already become possible because we were fighting for our homeland and, in fact, we were fighting against the fascists. So this is my greeting message to them, (missile) this is from me."" The date of publishing:

In reality, Kiev responded to an invasion by hitting military targets, and the attack on the Kremlin raises questions about the author. Moreover, it is Russia that has been declared a terrorist state by international bodies.
Propaganda: Ukraine is a terrorist and Nazi state attacking Russia
NEWS: ""The arrest of the diversionist terrorists who were going to liquidate the leaders of Crimea and Yalta and two drone attacks on the Kremlin with the aim of assassinating the President of Russia Vladimir Putin against the background of the permanent bombing of the peaceful cities of Donbass are clear signs of the character neo-nazi of Ukraine.
Many consider Ukraine to be a terrorist state, but not even Russia has the courage to designate it in this way. It is possible that this is explained by the fact that Russian gas passes through Ukraine in the direction of Europe, according to the signed international contracts.
Now, after the incident, Russia can designate Ukraine as a terrorist state or a state that uses terrorist methods of war. Then we must respond appropriately. [...]
The vice-president of the Security Council of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, wrote on Telegram that, after the attack on the Kremlin, there were no options left other than the physical elimination of the head of the Kiev regime, Volodymyr Zelensky, and his team. [...]
After the sinking of the cruiser ""Maskva"" for which we did not take revenge, after the terrorist attacks by the Ukrainian neo-Nazis on the Russian territory in the Kursk, Bryansk and Belgorod regions, after the bombing of the airfield in Crimea and Enghels in the Saratov region, people wonder how many more red lines do they have to be passed by the Ukrainians in order for Russia to respond appropriately?""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine is a terrorist state and must be punished by Russia.
Reality: Russia was designated a terrorist state by members of the international community and accused of war crimes on the territory of Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After attacking Ukraine unprovoked and launching numerous attacks against civilian targets (homes, schools, hospitals, etc., infrastructure) Russia was designated a terrorist state first by the European Parliament and then by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe . According to international investigations, at least 20 torture chambers in Kherson were operated directly by the Russian FSB, becoming evidence for the designation of Russia as a terrorist state. Moreover, in March, the International Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin, accused of war crimes in Ukraine. The document shows that Putin failed to properly exercise control over civilian and military subordinates who committed criminal acts or allowed them to be committed. Russia's aggression in Ukraine has been repeatedly condemned by the UN.
In this context, the Russian press made great efforts to exonerate the Kremlin and show Ukraine as a terrorist and Nazi state, recalling a series of events from the Russian-Ukrainian war, including the sinking of the cruiser ""Maskva"" in the Black Sea. The Russian press does not mention anything about the war crimes committed by the Russian military in Bucea, Irpin, Borodianka, Izium, Kherson and other localities.
Ukraine's military actions are a response to the unprovoked attack on the country by the Russian Federation. According to the UN Charter, Ukraine has the right to defend itself; besides, Kiev has decreed a state of war, unlike Russia which still calls its aggression ""a special military operation"". Broadly speaking, a terrorist state is one that uses acts of violence against populations not directly involved in the conflict, but with the potential for pressure on the leadership. The Maskva cruiser was a legitimate military target, as it was used by Russia to attack Ukraine, as well as ammunition depots and military bases, especially those in Crimea and Donbass, which are part of Ukraine occupied by Russia. There is, therefore, no legal basis for designating Ukraine as a terrorist state.
A Ukrainian drone attack on the Kremlin would be a response to the dozens of Russian bombings on Kiev (not to mention the other Ukrainian cities bombed, in some cases until they were turned into ruins); we must not forget the fact that, when it attacked Ukraine in February 2023, it was Russia that tried to eliminate Ukraine's leadership, and Volodymyr Zelensky personally was the target of multiple assassination attempts.
It is not very clear, however, that Ukraine was behind the attack on the Kremlin. Kiev has denied responsibility for this incident. ""We are not attacking Putin or Moscow, we are fighting on our territory,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a press conference in Helsinki. It is true that in the past Ukraine has also avoided taking responsibility for actions behind front, but on some of those occasions officials from Kiev made it clear that they were no strangers to the respective operations. Some Western analysts stated that it is possible that Russia itself staged the incident in order to blame Kiev and warrants a crushing response.
Pro-Kremlin media narratives indicate a preparation of public opinion for a new phase of the war, using arguments such as ""how many more red lines must be crossed by the Ukrainians for Russia to respond appropriately?"" The way the event is interpreted shows Russia as a patient, attentive and very tolerant state, which will have to become tougher in this confrontation at some point.
In reality, Russia has never shown restraint since the beginning of the war, but it has been trying to convince its citizens that it is saving Russian-speakers in Ukraine from Nazism and that it has launched a ""special military operation"" to protect the peaceful Ukrainian population. In fact, since the beginning of the war, civilians have repeatedly been the target of Russian attacks, among the notable cases being the bombing of the theater in Mariupol, the railway station in Kramatorsk, the convoy near Zaporozhye, the killing of civilians in Kiev, Lviv, Dnipro and other cities The retention of Russia in this war has become a traditional subject of Russian propaganda.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press demonstrates that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians would not -support the Nazi leaders in Kiev According to Russian government media, Ukraine will continue to assassinate Russians based on a list published online, while half of the Ukrainian military is foreign, which means that NATO is participating in the war.

The narrative resumes, in fact, one of the main themes of the (pro)Russian propaganda targeting Chisinau.
NEWS: ""The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine made an unexpected and secret visit to Moldova. His arrival was not announced ahead of time.
[...]
There is certainty that hidden topics were discussed behind the official agenda, that is, ""not for the press"", according to the Telegram channel ""Smuglyanka"".
The situation in the region is now very difficult. Fighting is going on nearby. Moldova helps the Kiev regime in all possible ways. The country actually became a transit territory for the transport of ammunition, fuel and many other things to Ukraine. In the light of the most recent reports in the press about the counteroffensive prepared by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it is possible that Kiev will ask Chisinau for something more substantial and important. We must always remember that Kiev has been talking for a long time about the danger that is supposed to come from Transnistria. There are large warehouses with Soviet ammunition, which are guarded by the Russian army. The group is very small. And literally ten kilometers from the warehouses, in Podolsk, Odesa region, the tank battalion of the 21st Ukrainian brigade is being reequipped. Russian experts constantly say that Ukrainian troops can cross the border with Transnistria at any time. Here's why, Dmitri Kuleba's visit in this context causes concern.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The Republic of Moldova offers (indirect) military support to Ukraine, thus violating its neutrality status. 2. Ukraine is preparing an attack on Transnistria, to occupy the ammunition depot, and is trying to draw Chisinau into the operation as well.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Dmitro Kuleba, paid a visit to Chisinau on April 27, during which he met with President Maia Sandu. The two discussed the situation in Ukraine, the security challenges, and Chisinau reiterated its support for the independence and territorial integrity of its eastern neighbor, according to a press release from the Presidency in Chisinau.
From the beginning of the war, the pro-European authorities in Chisinau condemned the Russian invasion, but announced that they would maintain their neutrality. The Republic of Moldova offered humanitarian aid to Ukraine and hosted hundreds of thousands of refugees.
Transnistria, a separatist region in the east of the country, governed by a pro-Russian regime, can be considered the biggest internal challenge to the security of the Republic of Moldova.
Russia has also deployed a military contingent in the region that, officially, guards an ammunition depot that belonged to the Soviet XIV Army, which was involved in the 1992 conflict on the side of Tiraspol. Russia has not fulfilled its international commitments to evacuate troops and ammunition. Currently, all Chisinau's steps regarding the withdrawal of its armed forces from the territory of the Republic of Moldova are commented by Moscow and Tiraspol as an attempt to destroy the pacification mission, although it is about different things. Incidentally, one of the main false narratives of the Russians and pro-Russians regarding the Republic of Moldova refers to the imminence of an attack on Transnistria that would be launched by the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine, Romania, the American military in Romania, etc. (the respective countries would act either individually or several at the same time).
OBJECTIVE: To present the Republic of Moldova as a military ally of Kiev in order to justify, on the one hand, a possible attack or interventions by Moscow, and on the other, to argue the Russian propaganda narrative to the Kremlin that Russia is fighting against a hostile alliance of states led by the USA and NATO.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: It is true that some Ukrainian officials have suggested in several cases that Ukraine would be ready to liberate the Transnistrian region from the control of the pro-Russian regime and the Russian military forces, but the authorities in Chisinau ruled it out every time this scenario and reiterated that they are only examining solutions to settle the conflict peacefully.
Most likely, if Kiev had tried to convince Chisinau to get involved in a potential attack on Transnistria, it would not have done it through the Minister of Foreign Affairs and not during a visit announced to the public, even if post factum. Most of the visits of Ukrainian officials abroad are not announced ahead of time, as happened in the case of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, for security reasons.
Both officials from Moscow and Russian propaganda have stated several times that Ukraine would concentrate military forces on the border with the Republic of Moldova, on the Transnistrian segment, which were denied by Kiev, whose army is concentrated in the east of the country to repel Russian attacks.
Russian propaganda launched rumors from the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine that the territory of the Republic of Moldova was used to deliver weapons to Ukraine, unproven statements by those who launched them and denied by Chisinau.

The Romanian ""national project"" is a form of aggression against Russia. 2. Russia is forced to defend itself against Western ideological attacks. 3. The full success of Romanian interests can only be achieved with the help of a strong Russia.
CONTEXT: The narratives were broadcast on the Telegram channel @triunghiulbasarabean, the phalanx of Sputnik, the main organ for promoting the Kremlin's propaganda in Eastern Europe.
The ""problem of Romanianism"" of the population of the Republic of Moldova is one with deep roots in history, anchored during the tsarist occupation of the territory between the Dniester and Prut rivers. The Romanian language was, since 1812, one of the forms of resistance to the Russification process.
The theses of Moldovanism - according to which there is a Moldavian language and ethnicity different from the Romanian language and ethnicity - were, moreover, launched before the invasion and occupation of the territory between the Dniester and Prut by the USSR, their promotion dating back to the period of the so-called Autonomous Republic Moldavian Socialist Soviets. RASSM was supposed to be the bridgehead for the capture of the Romanian region of Bessarabia, and Moldovanism was used to justify the respective territorial claims of Moscow. Over time, the idea was reached that the ""Moldovans"" were, in fact, part of the Russian world. Even today, Russia is fueling its hybrid war in Moldova by maintaining identity dilemmas and supporting the Moldovan current. In parallel, a campaign demonization of Romania starting from its alliance with Nazi Germany during the Second World War; since then, the Romanians as a people are categorized as ""fascists"" and the discussions about a possible union or about the identity of the population on the left side of the Prut as propaganda fascist.
Beyond the marginal discussions (whose importance is amplified by Moscow and pro-Russians) regarding a union between the Republic of Moldova and Romania, the identity issue is an important one in the Republic of Moldova, which practically gained its independence following the emergence of the movement for national revival who advocated for the Romanian language and the Romanian alphabet. Neo-Soviet revisionist forces imposed the phrase ""Moldovan language"" in the 1994 Constitution and it took almost 20 years for the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova to decide that the text of the Declaration of Independence (which establishes the Romanian language) ""prevails in relation to with the text of the Constitution"". After another 10 years from the Court's decision, the Chisinau Parliament adopted, in March 2023, the law that established the Romanian language as the state language, a decision that provoked vehement reactions from Moscow. For example, the spokeswoman of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zaharova, declared that ""Moldova is giving up its mother tongue"", and the measure would have been imposed by the USA. Intensified with the start of the invasion from Ukraine, but dating back to before 2022 , Moscow has spread several fake news and misinformation related to Romanian-Moldovan relations. Among them, the Kremlin claims that Romania wants to annex Moldova, being supported in this approach by NATO forces that will also help to annex some regions from Ukraine, or that Romania prevents Moldovans from going to work in the West, using the Soviet myth of the ""Romanian gendarme"" that wrongs the Bessarabians.
It should also be noted that, with all its specific nuances, the problem of Moldovanism vs. Romanianism can be framed in the wider dispute between the ""East vector"" and the ""West vector"", present in the last 30 years in several countries in the ex-Soviet space and manifested through the competition between pro-Russian political groups, which promote belonging to the ""Russian world"" and the proximity to Moscow (basically they support the formation of a post-Soviet bloc dominated by Russia, with subjects governed according to rules typical of the eastern space marked by authoritarianism, corruption and a state of law that is at best imitated) and political groups pro- Westerners who propose the transformation of their countries into liberal democracies integrated into the European Union.
OBJECTIVE: Amplifying pro-Russian sentiments, portraying Russia as a factor of stability in Eastern Europe, justifying the aggressiveness of Russian foreign policy, as well as weakening the confidence of the populations of Moldova and Romania towards the authorities and the West.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Discussions about a possible reunification of the territories of Romania and Moldova have existed since the fall of communism, in 1989, intensified after the declaration of Moldova's independence, in August 1991. However, they did not have majority support among the population in any from the two states, being rather the concerns of some marginal political and civic groups, although, occasionally, the subject also appeared in the speech of some high-ranking politicians.
At the official level, however, Romania is the first state to recognize the independence of the Republic of Moldova. Its sovereignty and territorial integrity were never discussed by Romanian officials. Moreover, throughout the 30 years of independence of the Republic of Moldova, Romania has been one of its most important supporters, both in moments of crisis that have arisen over the years (economic, energy, sanitary crises, natural disasters ) as well as in terms of wider European integration efforts. Romania's support was also manifested through direct financial assistance for various infrastructure, cultural, media projects, the granting of thousands of annual scholarships for pupils and students from the Republic of Moldova, etc. Bucharest's policies towards the Republic of Moldova remained the same even when they were confronted with the sometimes hostile and aggressive speech of some governors from Chisinau who promoted rapprochement with the Russian Federation and the theses of Moldovanism. What constantly irritated the pro-Russians and Moldovanists from Chisinau (and, obviously, their partners from Moscow) was the fact that Romania never accepted the historical falsehoods of Moldovanism and always emphasized the common linguistic and cultural identity and historical. In the same key, the older decision of Bucharest to allow those who had it during the period when the territory between the Prut and Dniester (on which most of the Republic of Moldova is located) was part of from Romania, but also their descendants. Reacquiring Romanian citizenship brought, moreover, a series of advantages, multiplied after Romania became part of the European Union, when those with dual citizenship also became European citizens. This policy was, however, a non-discriminatory one, as evidenced by the numerous cases reported by the press about characters with a speech deeply hostile to Romania who had also received Romanian citizenship.
On the other hand, Russia, which took over the Soviet theories of Moldovanism, pursued an often hostile policy towards the Republic of Moldova, manifested by supporting the separatist Transnistrian region, embargoes on Moldovan products destined for the Russian market (which led to a reorientation of Moldovan exports ), a hybrid war against Chisinau, etc.
The consolidation of bilateral relations between Romania and the Republic of Moldova is therefore due to multiple factors - Bucharest's constant policy of supporting Chisinau, Moscow's hostile acts towards the Republic of Moldova, but also the seizure of power in the Republic of Moldova by pro-European forces. The latter, by the way, are not unionists, the declared unionist formations failing to pass, in the last elections, the threshold of entering the parliament. Last but not least, the war in Ukraine must also be taken into account, which once again showed the danger that Russia represents for the former Soviet subjects and the importance of belonging to a space like the European one.
The idea that the collective West would encourage Romanianism as part of an evil plan directed against Russia is ridiculous. And in the hypothesis that this would be true, there is no rational argument attesting that the affirmation of the national identity of a sovereign and independent state would be an action against another, with which, on top of that, it does not even have a common border. In fact, by launching this narrative, Moscow only wants to justify its own revisionist actions, which resulted, among others, in the two Moldovan autonomous entities, Transnistria and Gagauzia, and which maintain the uncertain status of Moldova's borders. In addition, the thesis represents a specific local reformulation of the metanarrative by which Russia considers itself a victim of Western expansion, being forced to fight in a ""new war for the defense of the homeland"".
The eventuality of the formation of a single Romanian state represents a danger for Russia only in the logic of the Kremlin, which considers that the territories of other states belong to it. In the particular case of the Republic of Moldova, it is a conquered territory, annexed first by the Tsarist Empire and, later, by the Soviet Union. The fragment ""Patriotism must also be seen as a regional vision, not just a national one."" No war with your neighbor can bring you prosperity"" is rather a threat that starts from the assumption that Russia is a neighbor of Moldova, through the Transnistrian region, and that to be a patriot you need Moscow's permission. In addition, the premise that such of action would endanger the ""vital interests"" of Russia reminds us of the Nazi theory of ""vital space"", the fixed ideology with which it states that Moscow is fighting in Ukraine.

Fox News ""debunks"" the 2020 vote-rigging lie
wsj.com / Apr 18 2023; abcnews.go.com / Apr. 25 2023; edition.cnn.com / Apr. 26 2023; mediate.com / Apr. 25 2023
For Fox News, the most watched American television channel, the bill for the lies broadcast during the 2020 presidential election exceeds 787 million dollars. It is a historic amount that he must pay to the manufacturer of voting equipment Dominion, presented in his programs as being part of a conspiracy aimed at falsifying the result of the vote in favor of Donald Trump. Even if the compensation agreed by the two sides at the last moment before the actual trial represents less than half of the original claims of the Dominion company, it is a stinging defeat for the ultraconservative news station owned by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Dominion's lawyers presented to the judge 20 pieces of evidence considered defamatory, extracted from Fox News programs devoted to the elections between November 2020 and January 2021 and from relevant posts by journalists on the Twitter platform. Their content tries to accredit the idea that, through its voting machines, the Dominion company intended to defraud the elections, used algorithms designed to reverse the options and bribed politicians to use its equipment.
""It is a massive and coordinated action to steal these elections.""
""Electoral fraud will be committed through electronic voting.""
""They used the voting machines to cancel many votes.""
Such statements only supported and fueled the conspiracy theory launched by the still inconsolable loser of the November 3, 2020 election.
Donald Trump - November 2020:
""If you press a key or change a chip, you can press the button for Trump as the vote goes to Biden. What kind of system is this?
The judge in charge of supervising the process categorically rejected all the allegations promoted by Fox News, saying that it is as clear as possible that none of the references to the Dominion company associated with the elections are true. It is not excluded that an important role was also played by the disclosure of some emails exchanged by the station's journalists in which some showed their skepticism towards the election fraud theory, but especially the messages through which the executive director of Fox News instructed the journalists not to casts doubt on Trump's unfounded accusations because they affect the audience and ""damage the business"". Faced with such documents that prove the knowing promotion of falsehoods, there is a risk that the jurors will decide on an even greater compensation than the one on which the parties have come to an agreement. However, there is a good chance that the multibillionaire Murdoch will open his wallet again as soon as possible. In another lawsuit, which began in 2021, the company specializing in voting technologies Smartmatic, asked Fox News television for damages of 2 billion seven hundred thousand dollars.
Tucker Carlson - fired by Fox News, offered by Russia Today
currenttime.tv / March 7 2023; bbc.com / Apr 15 2023
A first and spectacular internal measure taken by Fox News after the costly failure of justice in front of the Dominion company was the announcement of separation from Tucker Carlson, far-right journalist, promoter of conspiracies and star of the station. Known as one of the most vehement opponents of the fairness of the 2020 elections, Carlson proved, like other company colleagues, a duplicitous character. While praising Donald Trump's policy and finding justifications for the assault on the Capitol in January 2021, the Republican TV star confessed in private messages that he detests the former president with all his being, whom he described as ""a demonic force"" and ""destructive"". . In the last year, Carlson adapted his agenda, becoming a vocal critic of President Biden's decision to support Ukraine against the Russian invaders, along with taking over other Moscow propaganda theses. His positions made him a privileged figure in the Kremlin-controlled television programs, which lamented his departure from Fox News. Moreover, the news also attracted the attention of the head of Russian diplomacy, who is in New York.
Sergei Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister:
""Maybe we should see how things are with freedom of expression in the USA. I heard that Tucker Carlson has left Fox New. It's a strange news. What will be the cause? We can only guess. It is clear that the pluralism of opinions in American society suffers.""
Lavrov's remarks came just a day after Russia Today, Russia's main state-controlled news network, tweeted a message to Tucker Carlson offering him a job. On April 24, Vladimir Solovyov, one of the Kremlin's prominent propagandists, victimized the American journalist, inviting him directly to join the producers of the evening show on the Russia 1 channel.
Vladimir Solovyov, journalist ""Russia 1"":
- Hey, Tucker, come work with us. ""Soloviov Live"" is waiting for you, Tucker! (...) Freedom for Tucker Carlson!
- Wait, they haven't put him in prison yet!
- Freedom of speech for Tucker Carlson!
Later, Soloviov's invitation was formalized in an email, in which Tucker Carlson is described as ""the last rational voice in the American mainstream press"".

""Hello and welcome back on Donbass Devushka podcast!""
This is the synopsis of the podcast entitled ""Donbas Devusca"" / ""Girl from Donbas"", uploaded in the heart of the United States on the Youtube channel of the same name. And the same playful-sounding name also carries an extremely active account on social networks, involved in the recent leaks of classified information about the war in Ukraine. Although she claims to be posting her comments from the Ukrainian city of Luhansk, the ""Girl from Donbas"" is an American get-beget born in New Jersey, her name is Sarah Bils and she was a naval non-commissioned officer stationed in Washington DC until last year. The 37-year-old veteran for years he has been sharing his sincere admiration for Vladimir Putin to hundreds of thousands of followers, in English with a fake Russian accent. He has created a small ""disinformation empire"" on Twitter and Telegram starting in 2021 with a group of friends. Once with the break-out of Ukraine, he established several accounts on which he constantly promoted Moscow's rhetoric. Donbas Devusca contributed substantially to the spread of secret Pentagon documents put into circulation by the recently arrested aviation technician Jack Teixeira. On April 5, the 65,000 followers of the Telegram channel had access to four altered photos of the alleged losses recorded by the Russian and Ukrainian armies.The former employee of the US Navy is currently being investigated by the FBI and the US Department of Justice in connection with the leak of classified documents.

In reality, Warsaw supports Ukraine's defense efforts against Russia's large-scale invasion, carried out with the direct support of Minsk.
Propaganda: Poland will go to war with Russia, after attacking Belarus and occupying Lviv
NEWS: ""The Russians must not hope that someone will ensure their victory, asking for peace on the streets of London or Berlin. No, the Russians must solve their own problems, preferably on the streets of Kiev. [...] The war between Poland and Russia will not take place following a post on Twitter by former Russian President Medvedev who often seems overly wise, while Polish politicians are very angry. Moscow will not order its troops to start the war, it does not want this, and neither will Warsaw, because it does not give orders, everything is decided in London and Washington.
[...] There could be an attack by the Poles on Belarus following an order from the Anglo-Saxons, followed by the introduction of the army into Lviv ""to defend the local Ukrainian population from Russian aggression"". This means the emergence of a new Polish front -Russian.
It will be a catastrophe for Poland if this is done. We must recover Liovul, but as hosts, and not as bodyguards of the Banderovists. Russia is our natural economic partner and also a valuable ally if Poland finally decides to follow its own geopolitical and civilizational path, independent of the influence of the West that colonizes us"".
NARRATIVE: The West will order Poland to attack Belarus and occupy Lviv
Reality: Poland supports Ukraine's defense efforts against Russia's large-scale invasion, carried out with the support of Belarus
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: To convince public opinion of Poland's warlike intentions against Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, the false narrative is based on the words of Konrad Rekas, presented by the Russian media as an independent Polish political analyst. In an interview for Ukraina.ru, he resumes a series of traditional propaganda messages and launches new ones. According to him, Poland is a colony of the West, which will do whatever the American or British political leaders say, while European citizens are protesting in various cities against the war started by NATO on the territory of Ukraine. The analyst recommends Moscow to win the war as soon as possible and not to count on the support of Europe.
In reality, Konrad Rekas is not an independent political scientist. He was a member of various Polish nationalist parties, after working as a columnist and correspondent of the ""Pravda"" newspaper from Moscow. The Polish political scientist is also a member of the European Center for Geopolitical Analysis, based in Poland and which has branches in Russia This center, according to the Russian media, sent observers to various elections in separatist regions such as Ossetia, Abkhazia or Transnistria.
Rekas does not represent the Polish academic environment, mostly illustrating Russian propaganda narratives like many other experts from abroad who collaborate with the pro-Kremlin press. Based on the statements of Rekas, the Russian press tries to convince the public opinion that Russia is a victim of the war, and Poland - a puppet of the West. In October 2022, this pro-Kremlin political scientist declared that Russia shows restraint in the war in Ukraine, especially when it attacks civilian targets.
In fact, Warsaw became a target of Russian propaganda because it was the most vocal of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of fighting Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. According to a sociological survey, 74% of Poles believe that Russia could attack Poland in the near future.
The false narrative appeared after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy paid a visit to Poland at the beginning of April. The highlight of the one-day visit was the meeting of the Ukrainian guest and the Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, with the Poles and Ukrainians at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. ""Russia will never win if a Pole and a Ukrainian stand side by side. We stand together in this war and we will rejoice together in peace. Shoulder to shoulder, together in the EU and NATO"", said Zelenski, his speech being repeatedly interrupted by applause.
On September 29, 2022, the secretary of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland, Stanislaw Zaryn, had to react to the repeated fake news about the state's desire to attack Ukraine, writing on Twitter that ""Russian propaganda continues to attack Poland informationally, promoting the lie about the Polish authorities' plans to attack Ukraine and annex western Ukraine"".
As far as Belarus is concerned, Poland has not shown any aggressive intent towards it, not even when Minsk pushed refugees from the Middle East towards the Polish borders, in an attempt to destabilize that was probably coordinated with its main ally, Russia. At the same time, there were also harsh statements against Poland and accusations - some coming directly from Minsk, others through Russian propaganda - regarding alleged aggressive intentions of NATO/Poland.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives by Russia regarding a possible aggression of Poland on Ukraine and the justified fears of Belarus of a NATO invasion. The Russian press wrote that a referendum on joining Poland will be organized in the Lviv region, after which Warsaw will start a war against Russia. The publications from Moscow tried to convince the public opinion that Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to capture a part of Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Belarus and Russia are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and possible NATO aggression. Publication / Media:

In reality, although the Republic of Moldova remains one of the poorest European countries, the economy and the standard of living have increased in the last decade.
NEWS: ""In recent years, the life of Moldovans has not improved, but rather the opposite. Prices have increased, inflation has increased, the unemployment rate has increased, the number of migrants from the country has increased. The standard of living decreased, the own production was reduced, which could not withstand the competition from the EU.
In 2014, against the background of the fighting in the south-east of Ukraine and the reunification of Crimea with Russia, the EU ""gave"" Moldova the liberalized visa regime in advance, but this only increased the pace of migration to the West of the population able to work.
NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European governments in Chisinau impoverished the population. 2. The approximation of the Republic of Moldova to the EU is to the detriment of the citizens and the economy, it causes the increase in prices and the bankruptcy of local producers.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova became, in June 2022, a candidate country for EU accession, and last week the European Parliament asked the Commission to start accession negotiations. Since 2009, the country has been led, with small intermittents, by coalition governments declared pro-European, but marked by conflicts between governing partners and corruption. In 2020, the pro-European Maia Sandu defeated the pro-Russian president in office, Igor Dodon, in the presidential elections, and in 2021, her party won a comfortable majority in the parliamentary elections.
The new government announced an extensive campaign to reform justice and the economy, but it was faced from the very beginning with rising inflation due to the pandemic, then with an extensive security, economic and energy crisis following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The government accuses the magistrates, but also a group of oligarchic politicians, of blocking reforms in the sector, and the overlapping crises have caused social discontent. However, Maia Sandu and the government enjoy a trust qualified by many experts as ""unprecedented"" from Brussels and other Western partners, which financially support the Republic of Moldova.
Maia Sandu announced the convening of a Grand National Assembly on May 21 to support the country's European path.
OBJECTIVE: To fuel dissatisfaction with the pro-European government, to increase the level of Euroscepticism.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Inflation in the Republic of Moldova increased year after year starting in 1991, both during the periods when it was led by pro-Russian, left-wing governments, and during those when the political right was in power. It is true that in 2022 an inflation of 30% was recorded, but this against the background of the war that seriously affected the economy of the Republic of Moldova, in the conditions in which the energy resources in Russia became more expensive and reduced, the access to the important Ukrainian market was heavily affected, and the railway system of Ukraine could no longer be used for transit as before.
According to the data of the National Bureau of Statistics, the highest inflation in the Republic of Moldova was recorded in 1992-1993, after the outbreak of the war on the Dniester (in which Russia was also involved) - 1800-2800%. In 1999, with the economic crisis in Russia, during the period when the Moldovan economy was extremely connected with the Russian one, the annual inflation was over 40%.
Statistical data reveals that the unemployment rate was 7-8% annually, at the beginning of the 2000s, when the country was governed by the Communist Party, and in recent years it has reached 3-4%. Anyway, in the Republic of Moldova, the unemployment rate should not be taken as an indicator of the well-being of the nation or the economy. This is low, on the one hand, because a good part of the workforce is abroad, and on the other, because many citizens work illegally.
It is not clear what the author had in mind by lowering the standard of living. Statistics show that the average income of the population was five times higher in 2022 than in 2006. It is true that these figures are not related to the inflation rate and the exchange rate, but correlated with those related to the consumption of food products suggest that Moldovans don't take it any harder and eat healthier. Thus, the consumption of meat per capita increased by 50% in 2021 compared to 2006, of fish and fish products - by approximately 75%, of dairy products by almost 30%, the consumption of vegetables and fruits increased by more than two or, instead, the consumption of potatoes and bakery products decreased.
The statistical data also reveal that the absolute poverty index decreased from 29.5% in 2014 (the oldest data), to 24.5% in 2021.
The volume of agricultural production has always fluctuated in the last 30 years, rather because of the weather conditions, than the competition of products from the EU. The production of the industry in general has increased since the 2000s. In 2022 it increased by approximately 45% compared to 2010. From 2014 (when the Free Trade Agreement with the EU entered into force), until 2021, Moldovan imports from the EU market increased by almost 600 million dollars, or by about 20%, while exports increased by almost 700 million dollars, or by 45%. During this period, the negative trade balance decreased by approximately 100 million dollars, which means that Moldovan producers and the economy, in general, had something to gain.
The biggest waves of Moldovan migrants were registered at the beginning of the 2000s. There are no official figures even now, but the liberalized visa regime does not allow Moldovans to work in the EU and the Schengen Area except on the basis of additional bilateral agreements. The Republic of Moldova obtained the liberalized visa regime on April 28, 2014, after initialing the Association Agreement with the EU and fulfilling a series of conditions.

Propaganda: Romania will annex the Cernauti and Odesa regions
NEWS: ""The peaceful partition of Ukraine with the participation of Poland and other states is a better scenario than Kiev's accession to NATO or a world war,"" said Dmitri Medvedev. The speech of the vice-president of the Security Council of the Russian Federation was published on the front pages of many Romanian media outlets, which shamelessly quote Medvedev's idea about the advantages of dividing Ukraine.
From what can be seen, the Romanian authorities are preparing the ground for the introduction of its troops on the territory of the Odesa and Chernivtsi regions in order to defend its ethnic Romanians from the ""evil Russians"". It is not difficult to understand that this process will be launched immediately after the failed counter-offensive of the Forces Armies of Ukraine"".
NARRATIVE: Romania supports Dmitri Medvedev's proposal to divide Ukraine and will occupy the Chernivtsi and Odesa regions
Reality: Romania fully supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The false narrative distributed by a series of Russian publications initially appeared on the Telegram channel of the pro-Kremlin portal Ukraina.ru, being picked up by the press bodies of the Russian Federation from the occupied Ukrainian territories. The Romanian press wrote about the shocking statement of the vice-president of the Security Council of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, who said that the world is now on the verge of a world war, but he would prefer to see Ukraine divided with Poland, Hungary and Romania instead. Screenshots of Romanian news agencies were published on the pages of the Russian press, which quoted Dmitri Medvedev (Agerpres, G4Media, Mediafax s.a.) presented as proof of the interest of the Bucharest authorities to participate in the the ""quiet division"" of Ukraine. No Romanian publication wrote that they agree with Medvedev's proposal, on the contrary, it was mentioned that it is not the first time that the Russian official makes controversial statements and invokes the threat of a nuclear war.
Without any proof, the Russian propaganda tries to convince the readers that Romania will annex the Chernivtsi and Odesa regions immediately after the Ukrainian counter-offensive in the east of the country fails to achieve its goals. This discursive nuance places the false narrative in the category of war propaganda, calling the Ukrainian counter-offensive a failed one, without it having been launched. In reality, Romania condemned both the annexation of Crimea in 2014, as well as the military events in Donbass and the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched on February 24, 2022. Bucharest was and is a supporter of Kiev. The Romanian authorities condemned the Russian Federation's aggression against Ukraine, drawing attention to the fact that Moscow must bear the consequences of this deeply illegal act. ""In full coordination with its allies and partners within NATO and the EU, Romania will impose firm and substantial response measures,"" President Klaus Iohannis declared on February 24, 2022.
As in the case of Poland, about which Veridica also wrote in the last 14 months of the war in Ukraine, the accusations against Romania are aimed at justifying the large-scale invasion, officially called in Russia ""special military operation"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press also wrote that the US will send 200 thousand Ukrainian suicide bombers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, while the Czechs are giving Ukraine weapons to bomb civilians. Russian propaganda claims that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and possible NATO aggression. Immediately after the invasion of Ukraine, the pro-Kremlin press accused Ukraine of wanting to join NATO in order to attack Russia, and Volodomir Zelenski will cede the Lviv region in the west of the country to Poland.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: Romanian Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu reacted to Dmitri Medvedev's proposal to divide Ukraine, stating that Romania fully supports the territorial integrity of the Ukrainian state. ""So embarrassing and wrong! Romania fully supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its efforts to win Russia's abominable war of aggression against the country!"", Bogdan Aurescu sent on Twitter, quoted by the Romanian press. The criticisms brought to Medvedev by Aurescu were not translated into Russian and published in the pro-Kremlin press network. Publication / Media:

In reality, Romania's territorial integrity is guaranteed by NATO membership and international legislation.
NEWS: ,, I have very bad news to give you all. This morning I was contacted by two people, who work in the system but are trying to save what they can, the following message was sent to me: fuck PL-x, that's not the problem, this year Transylvania will be broken from Romania. It seems that these two projects of mine for the unification of Romania have suspended the action, so it has stopped them, but the regionalization project is going on, the AUR plays the games of the UDMR, regionalization will be established, and later, on the Kosovo model, it will declares an autonomous region and will be under the leadership of Hungary. Moreover, Viktor Orban and Katalin Novak declared that, for now, they are staying a little longer, but they will never give up their dream of taking over Transylvania. So there were statements made, including during the visits to Russia. Attention, if Russia gets angry, it helps them, together with the Americans, as the Americans are not far away either. Yes? Why did they make their military base at Cincu? Think, it doesn't hurt! America collaborates very well with Viktor Orban. Viktor Orban made three visits in one week: Moscow, Brussels and Washington, where he arranged his whole plan. [...]
The problem is that several things were hidden. The motion on agriculture was hidden, the issue of Ukrainian grains that are genetically modified and that threatened the lives of our children was hidden. [...] The pediatric hospitals are full of children with stomach and digestive problems because of the products made from Ukrainian grain filth. They are made with Monsanto, with I don't know what, with pesticides from these disasters.
Attention, there is another problem! You should know that Prince Charles didn't come to Romania for nothing and he didn't buy houses in Transylvania for nothing. There is also a plan to conquer Transylvania by appointing Prince Charles king, including the land of Transylvania. [...] There is another plan that some gentlemen who came to your event revealed to me [n.r. - of Professor Florin Sandru] from the Romanian Academy, where they cursed the event, they big nationalists, and told me like this: Mrs. Sosoaca, you must help us to re-establish royalty in Romania. And I say, in what sense? Let's make Margaret the queen of Romania. So I wanted to throw up. [...]
So be very careful, what is being prepared for you. To me, the situation in Transylvania seems much more serious, and the fact that Orban found help from the Russians and in Brussels and Washington. Why isn't there a similar policy of Romania, to defend itself, to go and talk with the Russians, and with Brussels and Washington, from the position of verticality? Shouldn't we also talk to the Russians in this case, so that they stop helping Orban? Only that our attitude to end all economic and diplomatic collaborations with Russia, with China, with Serbia..."" NARRATIVES: 1. Until the end of 2023, Transylvania will be annexed to Hungary. 2. Ukrainian cereals represent an attempt on the lives of Romanian children. 3. Under the pretext of regionalization, Charles III will also be proclaimed king of Transylvania. 4. Romania will become a monarchy again, and Princess Margareta, the custodian of the crown, will be proclaimed queen. 5. The only power that can guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Romania is Russia.
CONTEXT: The Romano-Hungarian debate regarding the territorial belonging of Transylvania (former autonomous region of the Habsburg Empire) is, historically speaking, a recent one, starting in the middle of the 19th century with the start of national projects at the level of the whole of Europe. Both camps claimed Transylvania, some having political arguments (Transylvania had been part of the medieval kingdom of Hungary), and the others more demographic, as the majority population of the territory. For the most part, the conflict was a ""frozen"" one, interrupted only by three violent disputes: the armed conflict of 1848-1849, in which the Hungarians wanted the independence of Hungary (including Transylvania), and the Transylvanian Romanians supported the Habsburg regime from Vienna; the battles between Romania and Austria-Hungary, from the First World War, continued with the Romanian intervention against the Bolshevik regime in Budapest in 1919; and the Romanian offensive, after the insurrection of August 23, 1944, alongside the Soviet troops against the Horthy occupation from the northwest of Transylvania. After the Second World War, the forced inclusion of the two states in the communist camp, as well as the principle of the integrity of the borders of the European states, put an end to the conflict between the two countries. After the fall of communism, several politicians and society representatives civilians, both Romanians and Hungarians, brought the subject back to attention, for the accumulation of electoral capital. For this reason, there were also some controversial episodes, such as the tragic inter-ethnic violence in Targu-Mures, from March 1990, or the recent conflict erupted in the scandal of the heroes' cemetery in Valea Uzului.
On March 20, Senator Sosoaca submitted to Parliament a legislative proposal demanding the annexation of some territories belonging to Ukraine, followed shortly by one regarding the union of Romania with the Republic of Moldova, projects that the Robert Lansing Institute think tank said represented the the most recent operation of the Russian military secret services in Romania, with which Diana Sosoaca is said to be related. Among the arguments with which he publicly supported his two draft laws, Sosoaca used the thesis of a possible dismemberment of Romania, as a result of the war in Ukraine, in fact a reformulation of one of Moscow's favorite themes when trying to justify aggression against Ukraine. Last week, the senator brought up the ""real"" danger from Romania's borders, namely Hungary and its territorial claims over Transylvania, a much more sensitive subject, in the minds of Romanian nationalists, than Bessarabia or Northern Bucovina.
OBJECTIVE: Lowering the confidence of the population in authorities and international bodies of which Romania is a part, exploiting the fear of a part of the population that Romania could disappear, if the great powers take a decision in this regard, amplifying Russian feelings by portraying Moscow as the guarantor of the state integrity of Romania, the exploitation of a possible social uprising for electoral purposes.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The peace treaties at the end of the Second World War established the borders of the European states, recognized by the entire international community. Territorial claims on other countries can therefore only be settled by the agreement of the parties and the population of the respective territories. The hypothesis of an armed conflict between Hungary and Romania is absurd, given that both countries are partners both in the EU and especially in the NATO military alliance. Since 1945, the modification of the European borders was generally done peacefully, through negotiations between the parties involved (the dismemberment of the USSR, the unification of Germany, the dissolution of the Czechoslovak federation). However, there were exceptions - the Yugoslav conflicts, or some from the ex-Soviet space that led to de facto changes in the territories of the former republics (Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine), even if they were not recognized by the international community and still are disputed.
The evidence that Senator Sosoaca brings in support of her statement are pure fabrications, Viktor Orban did not tour the capitals of the world in a week, he was in Moscow for the last time in February 2022, in Washington in the spring of 2019 during the Trump administration, and in Brussels in February 2023, just as neither the Hungarian president nor the prime minister have ever declared that they will not give up their dream of bringing Transylvania back under the Hungarian flag. The fact that, at various events, several Hungarian officials display themselves with the insignia of Great Hungary, are nothing but purely electoral movements, identical to those of the Romanian nationalist politicians who wear the map of Great Romania on their jacket lapel or display it as a profile photo on social networks. socialization. In the continuation of the argument, Diana Sosoaca uses, as usual, bits of truth seasoned with personal speculations: the military base at Cincu, in Brasov county, is a NATO base, not an American one, and the soldiers stationed there are mostly French (about 700) , another contingent being represented by the Dutch, Belgians (approximately 150 in total) and obviously, Romanians. There are no members of the American armed forces at Cincu.
Bringing up the problems created by Ukrainian cereals is not a surprise, since it has been one of the main topics of interest on the political-economic agenda in Romania for some time, but for completely different reasons. Their entry into the Eastern European market, initially only for transit, was exploited by the big traders in the area. Thus, suddenly, a huge amount of grain, entered the market without customs duties, really led to a collapse of the price per ton, a fact that caused considerable losses to farmers in the area. For this reason, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia banned the import of Ukrainian grain. Using this pretext, characters with views closer to those of Moscow insinuated, as the senator from Iasi does, the insinuation that Ukrainian cereals are contaminated with various substances that make them extremely harmful for the human body. In reality, the cultivation of cereals in Ukraine is not subject to the rules of the European Union, and for this reason, Ukrainian farmers also use fertilizers that are not approved in the community space, for various reasons, from their origin to their quality. They are no more harmful to the human body than tomatoes helped to grow with chemical stimulants by Romanian vegetable growers, for example. As for Monsanto seeds, with the acquisition of the American giant by the German concern Bayer, they are subject to European legislation and, despite the major scandals and controversies in which the company was involved in the past, at the moment they comply with European standards, which Diana Sosoaca she suddenly feels so attached. The claim that pediatric hospitals in the archipelago have children with stomach or digestive problems because of products made from Ukrainian grains is nothing but a lie. The activity of pediatric hospitals is going on normally at this moment, with the passing of the wave of respiratory viruses related to the transition from the cold to the warm season.
The fantastic hypothesis of the coronation of Charles III as king of Transylvania initially appeared as a simple joke in the pages of a humor magazine, mocking the eternal status of crown prince of the current British king. The joke caught on very well, being taken as real news, even by the Spanish daily El Pais, in an article about the former King Mihai I. Later it was slightly modified, this time, the editors of the magazine asking the British royal house to sends Prince Harry to be king of Romania. Consequently, we will treat this topic as a joke by Diana Sosoaca, hoping that she still has a sense of humor.
In total contradiction with what she had stated above, Diana Sosoaca also brings up the return of the country to the monarchy, this time the crown being entrusted to the Royal House of Romania. However, this cannot be done without a referendum to amend the Constitution, and although the percentage in favor of the monarchy among Romanians is increasing (37% in 2019, compared to 27% in 2013), the initiative would be rejected, being, however, minority. In addition, the anonymization and ridiculing of the sources that the senator ""cites"" only increase, in turn, the ridiculousness of the theory.
Finally, Romania has not ended diplomatic relations with any of the countries mentioned by Diana Sosoaca. Moreover, we still have the same economic relations with China and Serbia as before Moscow's aggression against Ukraine. As far as Russia is concerned, as a member of the European Union, Romania has aligned itself with the economic sanctions imposed on it, and in military terms, as a NATO member, its reactions are only in accordance with the policy of the alliance and consist in strengthening the posture of deterrence and defense on its eastern flank . Regarding the territorial guarantees that a possible approach to Russia would provide us, we only specify that, for 200 years, from 1735 to 1944, Russia invaded the Romanian countries 12 times, breaking important pieces of territory, without mentioning the theft of the treasury, communism, or the intense Russification of the population of Bessarabia. Romania's security and territorial integrity are currently guaranteed by NATO membership, considered to be the most powerful military alliance in the world, with military and economic resources that far exceed those of Russia.

In reality, neither Kiev nor the West wanted a war, it being started by Russia to conquer new territories.
Propaganda: Since 2014, the West has been preparing Ukraine for a war with Russia, relying on various local Nazi groups
NEWS: ""Ukraine can hardly be considered a state because, first of all, it is ruled from outside. [...] When we have an external control, we are talking about a pseudo-state.
Secondly, the state is usually financed by its own industry, its own economy, by the people. In this case, the state does not finance itself. Therefore, it is very difficult to call Ukraine a state.
Thirdly, in the period after the coup, the economy of Ukraine was constantly destroyed. There was not a single year when we had a real economic growth, an increase in the population's income - there was no such thing.
The purpose of external governance was not development, but the preparation of this so-called state for war, for the implementation of a military scenario. [...] After the funding is stopped, this state will collapse, even fall apart.
[...]
Over the years, a significant part of Ukraine's population from the west moved to the center of the country, especially to Kyiv. There are mostly Ukrainians from the western regions. This is the only city or the only region that has always given Nazi deputies to the parliament""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine is a pseudo-state ruled from outside with the help of the Nazis to invade Russia.
Reality: Ukraine faces economic and other difficulties after being attacked by Russia, but neither Kiev nor the West wanted a war with Moscow
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The narrative was promoted by former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov, who fled to Russia during the pro-European protests of 2013-2014. The economic problems Azarov talks about were not generated by the West, but by the actions of Moscow, which annexed Crimea, supported the war in Donbass and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. In addition, Moscow weakened the economic Ukraine in peacetime, when Azarov was prime minister. The politicians who took power in the Ukrainian state in 2014 noted that the treasury was practically empty at the time of the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.
In reality, from 2014 until the start of the large-scale invasion, Ukraine developed from an economic point of view, and relations with the West became much more intense. In the years 2021-2022, the ""Great Construction"" program of President Volodymyr Zelenski was carried out in Ukraine, with bridges, roads, residential blocks being built following collaboration with international financial institutions. Despite criticism from the opposition, Zelenski cut defense spending and directed them towards the economic and social fields, which proves that Ukraine was not preparing for war, as the Russian press writes.
Mykola Azarov resumes another false Russian narrative, the one regarding the ""coup"" in Ukraine, after which President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia. It should be noted that Yanukovych was forced to flee after his regime responded brutally, including war ammunition, at the Euromaidan protests caused by Kiev's refusal - following Moscow's pressure - to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union. Yanukovych's flight was followed in May 2014 by presidential elections, and in October - by parliamentary elections , both of which are recognized by the international community, so the transfer of power took place through democratic elections, and not through a coup d'état.
As far as Nazism is concerned, since 2015, Ukraine has banned Nazi and communist ideology by law. Moreover, since the proclamation of the independence of the Ukrainian state, no Nazi party or candidate has entered the elections. The Ukrainian nationalist parties, which cannot be called Nazis, either did not pass the electoral threshold, or, when they did, they obtained a maximum of 6-8 percent of the number of mandates. The Russian press traditionally catalogs nationalist and identity manifestations in the ex-Soviet space as forms of Nazism/fascism. Anything that does not coincide with the ideological vision of the Kremlin leaders can be categorized as a Nazi in Russia.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the nature of the war in Ukraine and its ""Nazi"" leaders. The Russian press also wrote that Germany supports Ukraine to make the horrors of Nazism forgotten. One year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press proves that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that Ukrainians did not support the Nazi leaders in Kiev. According to the Russian government media, Russophobic foreigners will have the right to tear apart Crimea and Donbass after the liberation of these territories. Publication / Media:

Sports, the army and propaganda in Putin's Russia
ukraineworld.org / 22 Feb. 2023; slidstvo.info / 21 Mar. 2023
August 8, 2008. As the athletes of the Russian Federation greet the billions of viewers of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics with smiles, while the Kremlin's army invades Georgia. February 2014, Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia: the athletes of the host country collect medal after medal. 500 km away, compatriot soldiers trigger the annexation of Crimea. Six years later, on February 4, 2022, Vladimir Putin arrives in Beijing to participate in the opening of the Winter Olympics, although - due to a suspension for widespread doping - Russian athletes cannot compete under the national colors. During the parade of the Ukrainian delegation, the Russian president seems to be loitering in the official box. A deliberately defiant attitude, it was said then, when the whole world watched with concern the massing of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine. According to Western intelligence services, the Chinese leader would have asked his Russian counterpart to postpone the invasion of Ukraine until after the end of the Olympics. What happened. On February 24, four days after the extinguishing of the Olympic flame, but before the Paralympic Games dedicated to athletes with disabilities that follow every Olympics, the Moscow army began the so-called ""special operation"". Putin's apparent gesture of goodwill to Xi Jinping was not enough to respect the principle of the ""Olympic truce"", established by consensus by the UN General Assembly and which provides for the suspension of armed conflicts seven days before the Olympics until seven days after the Paralympic Games. Russia thus became the only country that violated the ""Olympic truce"" in the modern era, and not once, but three times in 14 years. Vladimir Putin's disdain for the internationally accepted Olympic spirit does not mean that the Kremlin underestimates the importance of competitions and athletes in promoting its political interests. On the contrary. Under his leadership, Russia is the unrivaled world ""champion"" in sportwashing - the English term that designates that form of propaganda designed to ""wash"" the compromised reputation of an individual, group or government with the help of sports. Russia partially managed to mitigate the deplorable image of its foreign policy by organizing the World Cup in 2018. With the invasion of Ukraine and the expansion of international sanctions at the sports level, Russia's objective is even more complicated to achieve. Athletes who show unconditional loyalty to the regime have turned into precious propaganda tools.
In the last 20 years, Moscow has created, literally, a real elite sports army to docilely, disciplinedly and facetiously support its reprehensible actions, be they internal or external. Just like in the Soviet era, following the model adopted then in the countries of the socialist camp - including us -, the military uniform became a second coat for most Russian Olympians. In 2021, at the Tokyo Olympics, 61 of the 71 medals won by the delegation ordered to compete under the auspices of the Russian Olympic Committee went to athletes associated with the armed forces. The absence of the insignia of the Russian Federation did not prevent the pro-Kremlin propagandists from speculating on the sports performance and forcing a transfer of a positive image at the expense of an oppressive state widely blamed internationally. The militarized Russian Olympians also have a very important propaganda role on the domestic level. The sports club through which the Ministry of Defense provides substantial salaries obliges by statute the athletes with epaulettes to popularize military service and convince as many young Russians as possible to enlist in the invading army from Ukraine. On the other hand, with rare exceptions, Russian athletes not politically regimented in Putin's army avoid pointing the finger at the aggressor in Ukraine and prefer the equivocation of general pleas for peace. In these circumstances, the Kremlin's sports machinery devoid of fair play is preparing for next year's Olympic Games in Paris, where it hopes to be admitted under conditions similar to those in Tokyo. Moscow's hope is maintained by the scandalous recommendation of a United Nations expert who recently advised the International Olympic Committee to allow Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine to participate in the Olympics, if they have not committed war crimes. As for the prospects of Russia respecting an Olympic truce next year, they remain gloomy.
The armies of Russian and Ukrainian hackers on the cyber front
currenttime.tv / March 7 2023; bbc.com / Apr 15 2023
At the beginning of March, the hackers of the Anonymus group attacked the Russian video platforms Wink and IVI, replacing the broadcast of the series broadcast by the popular Channel 1 with the reports about the bombings in Ukraine from the Current Time program, produced by Radio Europa Libera. The viewers of the stations Rossia 1 and Moscow 24 had similar surprises. It is only a recent episode of an unprecedented cyber war that discreetly accompanies, since the beginning of the invasion, a bloody armed confrontation. The outcome? Disintegrated or mutilated websites, stolen personal data, hacked communications. The BBC News journalist specialized in the field went to Ukraine to talk to combatants on the IT front and to find out how the government of each camp cooperates with the armies of cyber ""outlaws"" - these destructive forces that are difficult to control. He tried to- He interviews ""Killmilk"", one of the leaders of Killnet, a group with almost 100,000 hackers and supporters who have been attacking Ukraine and its allies since the beginning of the invasion. He refused, preferring to send, preferring to send a video with an arrogant and theatrically directed message. Among the documents that Killnet boasts of is the temporary removal from use during the Easter holiday of some sites in NATO countries by a team called KillNATO Psychos. There are not only Russians in the group of hackers. He was joined by an American and a Dutchman, who launched cyber attacks against a Ukrainian embassy. No target is excluded. Killmilk asked the group to attack even the networks of hospitals in countries that provided tanks to Ukraine. Despite the existing evidence, the head of Russian hackers has denied that the group acts with the support and under the protection of the military authorities. On the other hand, the 200,000 members of the so-called Ukrainian IT Army have been joined by vigilante groups such as Anonymous, which have launched hundreds of of attacks on Russia. Recently, another group called ""One Fist"" cyber-sabotaged a Russian radio station on the frequency of which it transmitted false aerial alarms. A notable success was the compromise of Cestnia Znak - the unique digital coding system for all products in Russia, including of fresh food -, which caused significant economic losses. Officially, Ukraine defends itself against cyber attacks with the support of Western military IT teams and private specialized companies, financed by donations. As in the case of Russian hackers, the conflict makes increasingly blurred the distinction between the actions of military specialists and clandestine activists.Ukrainian authorities say that the greatest danger is not Russian hacktivists, but IT specialists of the Kremlin's army, who coordinate their cyber attacks with actions on the battlefield.

In reality, the conditions that a state must meet to enter the EU have nothing to do with NATO, something proven by the fact that there are NATO member countries that have not been accepted into the EU.
NEWS: ""It is a well-known fact that the entry ticket to the European Union is the mandatory demonstration of the anti-Russian policy, and NATO membership is the best confirmation of such an approach.
After Maia Sandu won the 2020 presidential elections, and six months later, the Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) won the majority in the legislature in the early parliamentary elections, in the premiere, doubts began to be expressed regarding the need to maintain the status of neutrality .
The start of a special military operation was a real gift for official Chisinau.
First of all, the events that started in February 2022 allowed Maia Sandu and the ruling party to blame all the problems of the mediocre government on the military actions in Ukraine. Secondly, under the pretext of humanitarian rhetoric, the pro-Western leadership, contrary to the principle of neutrality and the interests of the Moldovans themselves, openly joined the Kiev regime.""
NARRATIVES: 1. Brussels conditions the accession of the states to the EU on the adoption of an anti-Russian policy and the accession to NATO. 2. In a first for the Republic of Moldova, the pro-European PAS government questions the status of neutrality and promotes NATO membership. 3. The Russian invasion in Ukraine is in favor of the government in Chisinau.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is a neutral state, according to one of the provisions of the contested Constitution of 1994. This neutrality does not exclude military collaborations with other countries/organizations, including NATO. The collaboration of the Republic of Moldova with NATO started back in the 90s, and one of the most important projects of NATO was the evacuation of important quantities of pesticides, left over from the Soviet era and which represented a danger for environmental pollution and soil and water poisoning.
However, the North Atlantic Alliance is still presented as a scarecrow for a good part of the population of the Republic of Moldova, who sees it through the prism of Soviet propaganda and, more recently, of the Russian Federation. In this context, surveys show that approximately 25-30% of the country's population would opt for joining NATO, the majority of the population opting for maintaining neutrality, even if this is not internationally recognized, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the 2008 invasion of Georgia have demonstrated that this statute is not a solution for ensuring security.
In 2006, during the communist government, the Republic of Moldova signed an Individual Action Plan with NATO, which is periodically updated.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the government in Chisinau emphasized several times the need to strengthen the country's security and defense capabilities, and its Western partners assured it that they would help it achieve its goals. This fueled the narratives of the Russian propaganda about the intention of the Republic of Moldova to join NATO, or even to get involved in the war in Ukraine against Russia
OBJECTIVE: To present the Republic of Moldova as a potential new member state of NATO and, respectively, an opponent/rival of the Russian Federation, in order to justify possible attacks/pressures on its part to secure its ""vital space"". To fuel phobias part of the population regarding the risk of the involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the war in Ukraine, due to the pro-European PAS/Maia Sandu government.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In June 2022, the Republic of Moldova obtained the status of a candidate country for joining the EU, having been presented with nine basic conditions related to ensuring the rule of law, the fight against corruption, and economic reforms. None of these refer to neutrality status/NATO membership or the adoption of an anti-Russian policy. Any country that meets the conditions for membership can apply. Known as the ""Copenhagen criteria"", these conditions include the existence of a stable democracy and the rule of law, a functional market economy and the acceptance of EU legislation.
The narrative that joining NATO is a condition for obtaining EU membership is also false, given that the European Community has accepted several neutral states - Ireland, Austria, Sweden, Finland - into its ranks. The last two applied for NATO membership (and Finland was accepted) after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when they considered that neutrality did not ensure their security.
On the other hand, there are NATO member states that are not EU members, including from the European continent. Turkey, for example, the NATO country with the second largest army, has been trying for decades to be admitted to the European Union.
The Constitution of the Republic of Moldova from 1994 was voted by a left-wing government in the context of the still fresh impressions of the war on the Dniester, but also of the uncertain situation in the south of the country, populated by a pro-Russian Gagauz minority that demanded independence. Over time, several of its provisions, such as the one related to the name of the language (the Constitution stipulated that the state language is Moldovan), as well as the one regarding neutrality, have been contested and criticized, and there have always been political forces and representatives of society civilians who spoke out for their review.
The war provoked by Russia in Ukraine refueled the discussions about the best solution to ensure security (as it happened in other countries of the world), and several officials declared that neutrality does not provide this security, as the invasion also demonstrated the Russian from the neighboring country. However, the government from Chisinau, including the president Maia Sandu, have stated several times that the change of this status can only be produced through a referendum.
Moreover, the Russian invasion caused discussions about the need to ensure security in countries that are much safer and with traditions of neutrality, such as the cases of Sweden (mentioned above), Ireland, and Switzerland.
The Republic of Moldova was one of or even the most affected by the war in Ukraine, after the invaded country. Besides the fact that the war seriously affected its security, the country being considered Russia's next target, if the Ukrainian army had not retaliated, it practically destroyed its economy. In 2022, inflation in the Republic of Moldova exceeded 30%, its economy being heavily dependent on imports from Ukraine, as well as on transport and transit routes. The high inflation, i.e. the increase in prices, has impoverished the population, among the poorest on the European continent, causing social riots, discontent and protests, which, of course, is not in favor of the government, as Russian propaganda claims.

In reality, the war in Ukraine was started by Russia, and the discussions about NATO policies 23 years ago are an invention.
Propaganda: In 2000, Vladimir Putin warned Ukraine about a possible war started by NATO
NEWS: 23 years ago Vladimir Putin visited Ukraine for the first time where he had negotiations with Leonid Kuchima. Despite the friendly atmosphere of the visit, the first problems in Russian-Ukrainian relations appeared then, especially regarding the expansion of NATO to the east. How did Putin strive to build a brotherly relationship between peoples and save Kiev from total dependence on the West? [...]
Then the problem of relations between Russia, Ukraine and NATO was discussed. Putin declared: ""No, Russia is not expected there. If they tell us that we are not expected, we will oppose the approach of NATO to our borders"".
According to the experts contacted by the ""Vzgliad"" newspaper, it was hard to imagine 23 years ago that the North Atlantic Alliance would expand in several waves to the western borders of Russia, especially that NATO would start a war against Russia through the Ukrainians Despite this fact, even then in Moscow they understood the long-term goals of NATO and the risks for Russian-Ukrainian relations [...] It was clear to everyone that NATO represents a danger not only for Russia, but also for Ukraine and its inhabitants They.
Political scientist Vladimir Kornilov from Donetsk claims that the Ukrainian elites did not listen to Moscow's warnings in the field of national security [...].
""Putin warned Ukraine several times about the fact that the West will use it as a consumable against Moscow, and the year 2022 confirmed this forecast,"" Kornilov said.
NARRATIVE: Kiev Ignored Putin's Warnings 23 Years Ago About NATO Policies That Caused Ukraine War
Reality: Russia launched an unprovoked military aggression against Ukraine, and NATO supports Kiev's right to defend its territory and population
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media is rewriting history to convince the public that NATO has launched a war against the Russian Federation through Ukraine, which ""is being used as a consumable"". According to this false narrative, Vladimir Putin predicted in during a meeting with the former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchima 23 years ago the evolution of events in Ukraine, but the political elites in Kiev ignored the warning. Therefore, according to the authors of the false narrative, it is not Russia that is to blame for the war in Ukraine, but NATO, which has a hostile policy towards Moscow and its partners.
In reality, NATO supports Ukraine's right to defend itself against Russia's military aggression, which launched a full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. NATO is not a party to the conflict, but only provides Kiev with equipment, weapons and ammunition, training soldiers and providing logistical support. Asked by journalists before the meeting of defense ministers from the member states in February if NATO is at war with Russia, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that ""neither NATO nor the allies are part of the conflict"". He repeatedly emphasized that the Alliance it is not part of the conflict, but only helps Kiev, which has the right to defend itself against Moscow's aggression, according to the UN Charter.
Vladimir Putin's warning from the year 2000, raised to the rank of prophecy by the Russian government press, cannot be found in any source from that time. Putin's forecasts are analyzed by political scientists and the military now, without there being any evidence that the Kremlin leader made such statements 23 years ago. Taking into account the friendly relations between Moscow and Kiev until 2004, but also the neutral status of the Ukrainian state at that time - which excluded, implicitly, the accession to NATO - it is unlikely that the subject of accession was a subject of discussions between the leaders of the two states. Ukrainians were asked by sociologists for the first time in 2002 if they want their country to join NATO and only 27.2 percent answered in the affirmative. At the same time, the former president of Ukraine initiated a national debate on the Ukraine-NATO relationship, causing an even greater drop in the level of support for membership, which was still seen by Ukrainians through the lens of Soviet propaganda. Ukrainian political analysts claim that the debate was specifically launched by Kuchima during the period of minimal support for the idea of ​​Ukraine-NATO rapprochement.
It should be noted that the press release from April 18, 2000 about Vladimir Putin's meeting with Leonid Kucima was kept on the Kremlin website, which does not say anything about NATO or other foreign policy topics.
Even if Russian-Ukrainian talks about NATO took place 23 years ago, which, somehow, remained unmentioned in the official communiques, they could not have had much importance, taking into account the fact that Vladimir Putin was on then acting president, pending the presidential elections, and the relationship between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance was a good one, according to joint reports. Anti-NATO rhetoric was launched later, especially after the 2004 enlargement of the Alliance and especially after the 2008 Russo-Georgian war.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives by Russia that blame the West and NATO for the war in Ukraine. The Russian press also wrote that the USA will send 200 thousand Ukrainian suicide soldiers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, to the offensive, and the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations. Russian propaganda claims that the EU sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022, Russia being forced to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and NATO. The press from Moscow tried to convince the public opinion that Russia and China want peace in Ukraine, while the West fuels the war. To encourage mobilization in Russia, the pro-Kremlin press also wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and possible NATO aggression.

It is a false narrative - the mine that Sosoaca refers to was from the Second World War, and Ukraine placed mines only to protect its own coasts.
Ukraine attacks Romania with sea mines and excavations in the Danube Delta
NEWS: Senator Diana Iovanovici-Sosoaca, president of the S.O.S. party. Romania requests NATO to intervene for Romania's defense after the Romanian shore of the Black Sea was attacked by a Ukrainian mine near the city of Constanta. [...]
Through Ukrainian mines that endanger the lives of Romanians, Ukraine proves to be an aggressor state towards Romania, and NATO must intervene. After all the expenses it made for Ukraine, paying heavily for refugees and bankrupting its own agriculture, Romania is now endangered by Ukraine's military actions.
It is not the first time that Ukraine affects the safety of Romanian citizens and endangers the state integrity of Romania. I remind you that a Romanian MiG-21 LanceR plane was shot down by the Ukrainians on March 2, 2022 near the town of Cogealac, approximately 95 kilometers from the border with Ukraine, and the IAR-330 rescue helicopter that went on a rescue mission had the same tragic fate. As a result of this aggression by Ukraine, 8 Romanian soldiers paid with their lives. Also, Ukraine endangers Romania through the illegal and prohibited works it does in the Bastroe Canal, this being an indirect aggression against Romania's territory and biodiversity, one that causes irreparable damage.""
NARRATIVE: Romania is subject to armed aggression from Ukraine.
CONTEXT: Diana Sosoaca, a politician extremely known for her anti-Ukrainian positions, is asking NATO for a military intervention against Ukraine, using as a pretext an incident that happened on April 13, when a Romanian fisherman hooked a sea mine in his fishing net, which was later detonated in the Midia port area, near Constanta. In motivating the request, Sosoaca brings as arguments several disinformation and fake news dismantled over time, in the pages of Veridica, including the re-editing of some propaganda campaigns aimed at discrediting Ukraine in the Romanian collective mind. Recently, the senator's public interventions were mostly directed against Ukraine, after, in March 2023, the Robert Lansing Institute think tank claimed that Diana Sosoaca had ties to the Russian military secret services. Thus, she submitted to the Parliament a legislative project that provided for the annexation of some territories belonging to Ukraine and intensively promoted the theory according to which, following the war, Romania will lose part of its territory in favor of a future Polish-Ukrainian federation. In addition, the senator from Iasi is known to be close to the Russian ambassador in Bucharest, whose invitations she honored every time. In one of the visits to the Kremlin representative, on February 10, the senator celebrated with him the ""humanitarian mission of Russia in the regions of Donbass, Zaporozhye and Kherson"".
OBJECTIVE: Increasing anti-Ukrainian sentiments, and by extension, Western sentiments by exploiting the fear of a part of the population that Romania could be attacked, amplifying pro-Russian sentiments, exploiting a possible social uprising for electoral purposes.
Several countries bordering the Black Sea have reported detonations of sea mines
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the Romanian naval forces have intervened six times to neutralize sea mines. In total, until now, 68 sea mines have been identified and destroyed in the Black Sea, by Georgia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Romania and, obviously, Ukraine, but no country has considered these events as aggressions on its own territory.
The mine that the EOD divers of the Romanian Naval Forces neutralized on April 13, a date from the Second World War, as it appears from the official statement of the General Staff of the Naval Forces and the images captured on this occasion. And last year, in August, the military navy destroyed a mine from the same period.
During the Second World War, the Romanian and German forces installed in the waters of the Romanian coast more than 20 dams consisting of sea mines of contact and influence, as well as explosive and breaking buoys, at the same time executing offensive mines in the north and south of the coast. During the same period, the Soviet troops launched an unknown number of magnetic mine barrages. Although after the end of the war, extensive dredging actions were undertaken to clean the mined areas and restore freedom of navigation, only a small percentage of mines were recovered and neutralized, due to the fact that many of them were uprooted and displaced by the waves. As a result, periodically, some of them are brought ashore by sea currents. In the 60s of the last century, for example, approximately 20 mines were unearthed annually, and were later destroyed by specialized teams.
Regarding the mines now placed by Ukraine, their purpose is a defensive one, given that Russia also targets the coasts of the attacked country and has a strong military presence in the Black Sea. The Russian military has operated and continues to operate in the Black Sea, launching attacks against Ukraine from there and harassing foreign devices or ships that are in or fly over the international waters of the Black Sea.
In order to make a possible marine landing more difficult, Ukraine has placed mines near its own coasts and in its territorial waters. There is a possibility that some of those mines will be pulled out and drifted from Ukraine's territorial waters to international waters or those belonging to other countries - but if this happens, this does not mean that Ukraine premeditated the act or wanted to attack NATO states. The hypothesis is all the more absurd as NATO provides significant assistance to Ukraine. Attacking a NATO state would mean not only stopping that assistance, but it would put Ukraine in front of a second opponent and lead to its losing the war. Publication / Media:

In reality, there were no biological weapons production laboratories in Ukraine.
Propaganda: The US has stopped the production of biological weapons in Ukraine due to the Russian military intervention
NEWS: ""The United States of America was forced to reduce its biomedical activities in Ukraine only because of Russia's special operation, according to a report published by the parliamentary commission investigating the activities of American biological laboratories in Ukraine.
""Due to the special military operation in Ukraine, the United States was forced to reduce and urgently move to other countries or regions its equipment, biological samples and other evidence that confirms the dangerous nature of its biological and military activities in Ukraine"" [. ..]
The document also states that the United States intensified medical-biological activities in the post-Soviet space and developed universal biological weapons, genetically modified, capable of infecting not only humans, but also animals or agricultural crops.
The authors of the report noted that in this way Washington intends to change the nature of armed conflicts in the future. Therefore, the commission of the Russian parliament proposed the launch of negotiations on the development of an international convention to combat chemical and biological terror around the world [...].
Washington has ""surrounded"" the Russian Federation with biological weapons, placing dangerous installations in the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics, as well as in the Kherson region.
NARRATIVE: The ""special military operation"" forced the US to move the biological weapons it was producing in Ukraine away from Russia
Reality: In Ukraine there were no laboratories for the production of biological weapons, and the ""special military operation"" is a war of conquest
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the report of the parliamentary commission investigating the activities of biological laboratories, also published on the website of the State Duma, does not include any evidence of the existence of laboratories for the production of weapons of mass destruction on the territory of Ukraine, and most of the arguments are taken from Russian propaganda narratives. The report presented by the Russian government press as a major discovery justifies the military actions launched on the territory of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, showing that Washington surrounded the Russian Federation with biological weapons that it installed in the self-proclaimed people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk, but also in Kherson region. Those regions where military actions are taking place at the moment are mentioned.
If a year after the launch of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian press wrote that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism, now the Kremlin's act of armed aggression against the Ukrainian state is justified by the danger of weapons American biologicals. The false narrative offers a new explanation to the Russian public why the ""special military operation"" must continue.
In Ukraine, there were no laboratories for the production of biological weapons, financed by the USA. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons. In spite of this fact, in recent years the Russian press has drawn the attention of the public opinion in the post-Soviet states to some American-Ukrainian projects in the field of biological research, without mentioning the fact that biological research is not equivalent to the production of weapons. The agreement between Ukraine and the USA in this field is presented by the Russian press as an element of the production of weapons of mass destruction.
In reality, such collaboration agreements also exist in the case of other post-Soviet states, and until 2012 the USA also cooperated with Russia in this field. The history of this false narrative is older - already in 2020 it was circulating to such an extent that the US embassy in Kiev felt the need to publicly convey that there is no secret American laboratory on the territory of Ukraine.
The parliamentary report also contains elements of the narrative of the besieged city, which in this version is surrounded by American biological weapons and threatened by the West's plan to destroy it.
With the outbreak of the large-scale invasion, the narrative of weapons of mass destruction was used to justify the Russian bombings. After Moscow intentionally or accidentally destroyed elements of the civil infrastructure in Ukraine, the Russian press came up with explanations that they were in fact bombed American biological weapons laboratories that were in those buildings.
During 2022, Veridica monitored most of the Russian narratives regarding biological weapons production laboratories on the territory of Ukraine and found that they are all inventions of pro-Kremlin propaganda, devoid of any basis.
For example, in March 2022, the Russian press wrote that the coronavirus was produced in secret laboratories in Ukraine. At the beginning of the invasion, Kremlin spokesmen declared that Russia destroyed American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine, and in May 2022 another false narrative was distributed, according to which the EU fears tuberculosis from NATO laboratories in Ukraine. In August, the topic of biological laboratories was linked to that of the critical situation in the area of ​​the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. The Russian press then wrote that the US would cause a nuclear disaster in Ukraine to hide the traces of biological weapons laboratories, later writing that all the evidence had been eliminated.

The false narrative of the preparation of a war in Transnistria is thus resumed, this time with an invented number: the Republic of Moldova would have no way of mobilizing a million people.
NEWS: ""The exercises of the reservists of the National Army of Moldova, which lasted a week, ended today. Several hundred people marched on this occasion left-handed and sang the national anthem wholeheartedly. They did not make a military impression.
However, the retraining, during which one million reservists will study NATO military equipment and techniques, will last until September 15.
[...]
The Moldovan opposition journalist Nicolai Kostirkin believes that the problem of the country's involvement in NATO, and maybe even in Romania, will be solved by the liquidation of Transnistria.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The Republic of Moldova is preparing (it is forced by the West/NATO) to attack Transnistria 2. The bridges over the Prut are being repaired, the army is buying equipment and a million reservists have been called into the army for the war.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In recent months, Russian propaganda has intensified a media campaign about alleged preparations of the Republic of Moldova with the support (or at the behest) of the West/Ukraine for an attack on the Transnistrian separatist region. The presented scenarios and goals are different: to open a second front against Russia (given that Transnistria does not have a common border with Russia or with the current front line); to take control of the military warehouse in Cobasna and transfer the ammunition there to the Ukrainian army, even though they are outdated, coming from the Soviet period, and many military experts say that they are unusable.
A variation of this scenario is the accession of the Republic of Moldova to NATO. Any declaration of support for the Republic of Moldova by officials or leaders of NATO member states, every meeting or joint military exercises (which have been taking place periodically for years) are classified as arguments for the country's preparations for joining the North Atlantic Alliance.
OBJECTIVE: To present the Republic of Moldova as a warlike state, dangerous for the security of Russia and Russian citizens (from Transnistria) and, respectively, to justify possible sanctions/pressures/attacks by Russia on it. To refuel the anti-NATO phobias, created during the Soviet period and maintained by Russian propaganda among the citizens on both banks of the Dniester.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Being neutral by the Constitution, the Republic of Moldova can change this status only by amending the Supreme Law, a lengthy procedure that can be carried out either through a referendum or through a legislative action, with two-thirds of the votes. For now, none of the conditions are met. All surveys show that the majority of the population would be against joining NATO, and in the Legislature there is no qualified majority that could modify the Constitution. President Maia Sandu reiterated on April 10, during a program on Pro, TV Chisinau, that accession to NATO can only occur after a referendum.
Meanwhile, Chisinau rejected any scenario of an attack on the Transnistrian region and continues to plead for the identification of a peaceful solution to the conflict.
The statements in the Russian press related to the training of reservists are interpreted and exaggerated. It is true that the Ministry of Defense announced the exercises, but the representatives of the institution draw attention to the fact that such exercises take place annually. The exercises lasted five days, not a week, as the authors of the article claim.
The number of ""one million reservists who will learn NATO military tactics and techniques"" is obviously exaggerated. With a population of approximately 2.6 million people, the Republic of Moldova cannot have one million reservists. In addition, at the military exercises are called the people who have completed the military service or graduated from the military department, being several thousand people per year. For example, in the first half of this year (when according to the Russian propaganda the Republic of Moldova is preparing for war), it is foreseen the incorporation of no more than 1,500 recruits. The Republic of Moldova does not even have the necessary logistical capacity to train one million reservists in four rounds, that is, to provide training, accommodation, transport for 250,000 people at the same time. Although politnavigator speaks of one million reservists, even at the beginning of the article it is written that several hundred people participated in the first stage.
The authors of the scenario do not take into account the fact that Moldova, a neutral state by the Constitution, has one of the smallest, poorly equipped and poorly financed armies in the world, despite the fact that there is a frozen conflict on its territory, Russian soldiers stationed without its consent, and strong separatist armies that threaten its security. All these aspects make it less capable of starting a war, but also less eligible for NATO membership.
Chisinau and Bucharest have been discussing the need to repair the current bridges and build others for years, so the respective decision of the Chisinau Government to initiate negotiations with Bucharest on the document regarding the modernization of three bridges (to which the Russian press is most likely referring) it is, in fact, part of the bureaucratic procedures that were launched a long time ago.
The Defense Ministries from Chisinau and Bucharest have repeatedly denied falsehoods about alleged border crossings of Romanian military equipment. If it refers to more recent data, it could be about the movements of Moldovan military equipment, about which the institution from Chisinau informed the citizens.
Soldiers of the National Army of the Republic of Moldova have been participating in the JCET exercises since 2009, so those carried out this year cannot be classified as an exceptional action, related to the supposed accession of this state to NATO.
NUTS OF TRUTH: In the context of the security risks caused by the Russian military invasion in Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova is making efforts to increase its defense capabilities, including financial support from its Western partners. Publication / Media:

In reality, the USA clearly discouraged any operations on Russian territory, but recognized Ukraine's right to operate on its own territory, including that illegally annexed by Moscow.
Propaganda: Russian regions will be bombed by Ukraine with US consent
NEWS: ""The strategic communication coordinator of the White House, John Kirby, said at a briefing that the United States allows Kiev to bomb the new regions of Russia, but Kiev will not be supported to carry out military operations outside its territory, reports RIA news
""We do not offer support and we do not push the Ukrainians to hit targets outside of Ukraine,"" he assured.
At the same time, Kirby noted that Washington allows the Armed Forces of Ukraine to carry out military operations in Crimea, the republics of Donbass, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions in order to occupy these territories.
In his speech, the White House coordinator preferred to remain silent about the numerous attacks by Ukraine on the Kursk, Belgorod and Briansk regions.
Previously, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the new Russian regions should be integrated into the single legal space of the country as soon as possible. ""The task is to do everything to integrate these historical Russian lands of Donbass and Novorossia into the economic, legal and educational space of our country as quickly as possible,"" explained the head of state.
NARRATIVE: The US allowed Ukraine to bomb Russian regions
Reality: Ukraine has the right to defend itself against the aggression of the Russian Federation and to carry out operations to liberate the occupied territories
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The narrative distributed by the Russian government press, but also by the Telegram channels in Russia and in the occupied regions of Ukraine, contains a series of inadvertences and logical contradictions. On the one hand, the headline of the news shows that the American official agrees with the bombing of Russian regions by the Ukrainian army, on the other hand, the text mentions the fact that it refers to Donbass or Crimea and that ""he does not push the Ukrainians to hit targets outside Ukraine"". At the same time, the news appears in most mass communication channels with a title that aims to manipulate public opinion and sow fear among the Russian-speaking population.
In reality, as shown by the American press, John Kirby declared that the US does not encourage the Ukrainians to open fire on Russian territory, his statement being a reply to the accusations of Russian officials, who declared that Kiev is murdering journalists on the territory of the Russian Federation with the support the West. Kirby added that the US will support Kiev's efforts to recover the territories lost following the armed aggression launched in 2014, without launching military operations in other regions.
The notion of new territories of the Russian Federation is an invention of the Moscow press, and the American official did not mention them anywhere in his speech. The Russian press, copying the Kremlin's official narratives, calls Crimea and the regions in the south-east of Ukraine as new territories of Russia, which we do not find in the statements of Western leaders. Both Kirby and other American officials believe that Ukraine has the right to defend itself from Russian military aggression and to liberate its territories based on the norms of international law, especially the UN Charter. The community of international states condemned the war in Ukraine and did not recognize the annexation of Crimea or the four regions in the east and south of Ukraine. That is why Kiev has the right to carry out operations to liberate these territories, which are from a legal point of view regions of Ukraine. Any attempt to liberate these territories is not a bombing of Russian territory. In fact, this legal reality is recognized by the Moscow press itself, which mentions the Kursk, Belgorod and Briansk regions, as if to imply that there are real Russian regions and new, less real regions.
Russian aggression has been condemned by most of the world's states several times. 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. A series of international mechanisms have been launched to designate Russia as a state that finances terrorism. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of being responsible for war crimes committed in Ukraine.
At the same time, the narrative in question tries to convince the public opinion that the Ukrainian army depends on the Pentagon for decision-making, and that bombing Russian territory requires US approval. From this point of view, the news is a continuation of the false narrative, recently dismantled by Veridica, according to which Ukraine will assassinate with the agreement of the West on Russian territory more and more people mentioned on the Mirotvoret website, which would show who are the regime's next targets from Kiev.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine, knowing that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. In order to convince public opinion of the necessity of mobilization in Russia, the Russian press wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and a possible NATO aggression.

The narratives are similar to those promoted by Russia, especially the meta-narrative regarding the artificial nature of the Ukrainian state.
Ukraine will be torn into pieces, but also supported to lay hands on new territories
NEWS: ""I admit that I talk a lot with people from outside the country. If more parliamentarians had agreed to go to the Russian Embassy, ​​they could have had a normal discussion, it would have been understood between words. They present some points of view from which to draw conclusions. It was interesting at an event where I was curious to see what it meant. I learned that there was an extensive Polish Empire that occupied a large part of Russia. Discussing with parliamentarians from Poland and Hungary, I understood that the war in Ukraine opens the possibility of recovering the territories. Why is the problem like this? Discussing with military analysts, over the course of months, why are the Russians afraid of the Polish Empire? They owned a large part and spread out, it was a dictatorial occupation. How did Ukraine allow such a thing? Considering Zelensky's behavior, he is not doing it to the advantage of Ukraine, but to the advantage of the USA. Ukraine will be destroyed in pieces and everyone will eat from there. The plan to destroy Romania and divide it into several parts, negotiations are underway in this regard. Ukraine is supported to recover territories that have never historically belonged to it, let alone Crimea, but we who have evidence and have always been ours are not supported and defamed. The Nazi empire was rebuilt in Ukraine. I don't think it's just me, a lot of trained people proved me right. The legal procedures are simple""
NARRATIVES: 1. Romania is in danger of disappearing, threatened by the future Polish-Ukrainian federation. 2. Ukraine is an artificial state, from territories stolen from other countries. 3. Poland wants to recover the territories from the time of the Polish-Lithuanian union, including some that are today part of the Russian Federation.
CONTEXT: In an interview given last week, the independent senator Diana Sosoaca explained the reasons why she submitted the two extremely controversial bills in the Romanian Parliament, which demanded the annexation of several territories that belonged to Romania but are currently part of Ukraine, and the start of union negotiations with the Republic of Moldova. The senator's explanations abound in false information and distortions of history, similar to those used by Moscow propaganda to justify the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Discussions about a possible Polish-Ukrainian federation have appeared in the public space of the two countries since the summer of last year. They, analysts say, would be based on the nostalgia of conservative Poles for the Republic of the Two Nations, a Polish-Lithuanian state union that existed between the 16th and 18th centuries. It is often idealized in Polish culture, due to the political power it represented in Europe at the time, and its multinational character made even voices from the progressive-multicultural area support its re-editing. The idea of ​​a Polish-Ukrainian state was fueled, however, by Moscow, in order to justify its propaganda thesis that states that Poland wants to annex its former territories, now belonging to Ukraine - which is part of the thesis regarding the artificial nature of of the Ukrainian state, promoted to justify Russia's territorial claims against its neighbor.
The idea was interpreted in her own way by Diana Sosoaca, known for her anti-Ukrainian positions. As a pretext, this uses an expression of the Polish President Andrzej Duda, from the beginning of April 2023, by which Poland's commitment to fully support Ukraine in its defense war is strengthened, identical to the one used in May 2022, namely that between Poland and Ukraine ""will no longer have borders"". In addition, in addition to the propaganda disinformation that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories, or that Zelenski will cede the Lviv region to Poland, already dismantled in the pages of Veridica, Sosoaca adds a new scenario, in which Romanian territory will be divided, it is not known exactly between whom, and Ukraine, after losing significant parts of its territory, will receive as compensation territories that never belonged to it.
In March 2023, the Robert Lansing Institute think tank claimed that Diana Sosoaca has connections with the Russian military secret services and that the most recent operation of the GRU in Romania is the bill submitted by the senators, regarding the annexation of a part of the territory of Ukraine. In addition, the senator from Iasi is known to be close to the Russian ambassador in Bucharest, whose invitations she honored every time. In one of the visits to the Kremlin representative, on February 10, the senator celebrated with him the ""humanitarian mission of Russia in the regions of Donbass, Zaporozhye and Kherson"".
OBJECTIVE: Increasing anti-Western sentiments by exploiting the fear of a part of the population that Romania's borders could be withdrawn in an unfavorable way, amplifying anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian sentiments, exploiting a possible social uprising for electoral purposes.
The inviolability of borders, the fundamental principle of European peace
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Since the Second World War, with the exception of the Yugoslav wars, the borders of the European states, recognized by the entire international community, were defined peacefully, through negotiations between the parties involved (the dismemberment of the USSR, the unification of Germany, the dissolution of the Czechoslovak federation ). Even in the absurd hypothesis of the creation of a new state, through the union of Poland and Ukraine, which would have territorial claims on other countries, the respective territories could only enter its component with the agreement of the concerned states or by triggering an armed conflict. Our country's membership in NATO strongly discourages such a scenario, especially since Poland is also a member of the Alliance. Poland has become a target of Russian propaganda because it is the most vocal of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. In fact, the only source of information indicated by Senator Sosoaca to support her statements is the ""points of view"" expressed in the discussions held at the headquarters of the Russian embassy in Bucharest. These ""points of view"" of Moscow related to the Romanian territory are very known since 2017, when Putin presented former Moldovan president Igor Dodon with a map of Greater Moldova, during his visit to the Kremlin. It should be noted that Russia is the main European state that disputed the borders after the Second World War and those drawn with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the USSR. Russia has torn pieces from the territory of other countries and established phantom territorial formations, whose only means of existence are the strength of the Russian army and the money sent from Moscow: Transnistria and Gagauzia in the Republic of Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea in Ukraine, aggressions that preceded the war started on February 24, 2022, resulting so far in the annexation of four Ukrainian provinces, the aforementioned Donetsk and Luhansk (previously only supported) as well as Kherson and Zaporizhia. All four were annexed although they were not entirely under the control of Russian forces.
The territorial integrity and borders of Ukraine were recognized, according to international treaties, by the entire international community, and even, through the Budapest Memorandum, from 1994, Russia - along with the United States and Great Britain - offered security guarantees to Ukraine, which accepted that, instead, he would give up the nuclear arsenal he had inherited from the Soviet Union. A discussion about Ukraine's borders can only be done, in the era of the supremacy of international law, only at the initiative of Ukraine. The fact that certain provinces of today's Ukraine were part of the territory of other countries cannot be an argument to declare this country as artificial, and the Ukrainian people, a branch of the Russian one. And if we invoke the past for territorial abductions, of course we cannot ignore the fact that between 1918 and 1920, Ukraine included both the Crimean peninsula, the area of ​​the city of Rostov-on-Don and the Taman peninsula up to the border with Georgia, and Russia had no access to the sea at all Black. In fact, this thesis is one of Moscow's favorites when trying to justify aggression against Ukraine. Veridica has several times dismantled this false narrative, exported by the Kremlin and in the countries bordering Ukraine, both to obtain international support and to maintain a conflict situation between Ukraine and its neighbors.
Since the beginning of the war, Poland has on countless occasions affirmed its support for Ukraine strictly in the sense of material and military aid, denying the intention to annex territories that are part of Ukraine today. The fact that the medieval Polish-Lithuanian state (about which Diana Sosoaca found out with surprise only now) included, at one point, the Smolensk region, today part of Russia, does not mean at all that Warsaw would have territorial claims against Moscow, representing a threat to it. In addition, contrary to the statement of the unaffiliated senator, the medieval Polish state was not an empire, and for those times, not at all a dictatorial one. Moreover, the Polish-Lithuanian state union is even considered a precursor of democracy and constitutional monarchy, but also of federalism, in which the two states that formed the federation were officially equal. The Union is known for the second written constitution in the world, as well as for a relative religious tolerance, which allowed Orthodoxy for the lower class, but only accepted Catholics among the nobility. In fact, the narrative in question is nothing but a reformulation of the thesis by which Russia considers itself a victim of Western expansion, being forced to fight in a ""new war for the defense of the homeland"".

In reality, the Ukrainian combat units are coordinated by the General Staff in Kiev, and the newly formed brigades are mainly composed of experienced soldiers.
Propaganda: The Ukrainian army is directly subordinated to the US, and the soldiers will be sent to certain death in an offensive
NEWS: ""The most different local and Western independent sources announce a serious preparation of NATO and the General Staff of Ukraine for the battle in the Great Azov region. During the meeting with the President of Poland Duda, Zelenski declared that there can be no question of an armistice concluded with the Russian Federation [...]
The Ukrainian press, including the publication Kiev Independent, close to the Presidency, informs that Zalujnyi and Syrskii continue to form an assault group in Zaporozhye, composed of 20 brigades. 5 more brigades are preparing for the offensive in Mikolaiv and the Kherson region on the right of the Dnieper [...] in total, two hundred thousand soldiers, supported by two thousand technical units.
At the moment, according to some people from the president's office, the US Department of Defense, through its instructors, is forming 9 ""American"" brigades that are not subordinated to either the General Staff or the Presidency in Kiev. In fact, the Pentagon is creating own armed forces under a false flag on the territory of a foreign state.
[...] They are, in fact, ""suicide brigades"", thrown into the ""meat grinder"" in the Azov area which will cause the failure of the Ukrainian Wehrmacht led by Zalujnyi"".
NARRATIVE: The US will send 200,000 Ukrainian suicide bombers, directly subordinated to the Pentagon, into the offensive.
Reality: The Armed Forces of Ukraine are subordinate to Kiev, and the counteroffensive will be launched when they are sufficiently equipped to increase their chances and have as few losses as possible.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In this article, massively distributed by the Russian press, the Ukrainian army is called the Wehrmacht, which was the official name of the armed forces of Nazi Germany between 1935 and 1945. It is a new attempt by Russian propaganda to show that Ukraine it is closely related to the Nazi ideology, even regarding the military organization.
According to this false narrative, the Pentagon is preparing an offensive against Russia, using the mobilized Ukrainian military, who will become cannon fodder when they are sent to the ""meat grinder in the Azov area"". The Ukrainian army would be directly subordinated to the US, which they will send the military to certain death against their will. The Russian press quotes various independent and Western sources or those close to President Zelenski, without showing exactly what they said or where the so-called statements were recorded.
In reality, in February Ukraine announced the formation of several additional brigades of the National Guard, the National Police and the State Border Service within the national project ""Offensive Guard"". The backbone of the new brigades consists of officers and soldiers who have extensive experience of fighting in different areas of the front in the east of the country or another military experience. According to the Ministry of Defense in Kiev, the new brigades are composed of ""motivated patriots"", being called elite reserve troops. The respective soldiers were invited to join the army to participate in the future offensive operations, and the defense actions involve men without experience, but who have passed the necessary military training.
At the same time, on the territory of Ukraine all the armed forces are subordinated to the Major General Statute. According to Ukrainian legislation, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is appointed by the President and voted by the Parliament, periodically reporting to the legislature. Neither the US, nor any other country, can have troops on the territory of Ukraine without the consent of the Parliament in Kiev, and the coordination of the Ukrainian army by foreign forces is not allowed by the legislation.
The Ukrainian spring counter-offensive, planned in Kiev at the end of last year, was postponed due to the prolongation of the fighting for Bahmut, but also the delayed supply of some types of weaponry by the West, according to Ukrainian military analysts.
It is true that Ukrainian soldiers are trained in the West, but this training has the role, on the one hand, of familiarizing them with the Western equipment delivered to Ukraine and, on the other hand, with operational standards and modern combat. The purpose of this training and equipping with modern weapons is precisely to reduce losses as much as possible in case of a counter-offensive. Russia, on the other hand, is the one that did not take into account the human and material costs of its campaign. Throughout the war, the lack of training of the Russian soldiers and commanders could be observed and it was seen that they operate according to outdated procedures, specific to the 20th century. On the eastern front, in Bahmut, Soledar and other localities, the Russians attacked in human waves, probably the most expensive offensive method. All these factors led to significant losses among the Russian army. On the other hand, Ukraine, disadvantaged in terms of human resources and equipment, waged a war from the very beginning in which it tried to inflict the greatest possible losses on the opponent while minimizing, at the same time, its own losses.
The way in which this news is presented demonstrates the desire of the Russian propaganda to discourage the involvement and resistance of Ukrainians in the face of Russian aggression, to distance the population from the political leaders. NATO countries are not participating in the war in Ukraine. Asked by journalists before the meeting of defense ministers from the member states in February if NATO is at war with Russia, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that ""neither NATO nor the allies are part of the conflict"". He repeatedly emphasized that the Alliance it is not part of the conflict, but only helps Kiev, which has the right to defend itself against Moscow's aggression, according to the UN Charter.
After more than 13 months of large-scale war, Russian propaganda shifts the emphasis to the narrative about NATO and/or the US that want to destroy Russia at any cost, consolidating the image of the external enemy to minimize discussions about the failures of the ""special military operation"". at the same time, Russia is doing everything possible to minimize Ukraine's effort to mobilize new human resources, necessary to resist the armed aggression.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aimed to distort the truth about the war in Ukraine. According to the Russian media, the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the EU has sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022. The pro-Kremlin media also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are freed from Russia. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion starting from November 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

Romanians will be forbidden to travel outside the space designated by law
NEWS: ""From now on, what was called the ""conspiracy theory"" is becoming a reality in Romania. A draft law ""on sustainable urban mobility"" initiated by the Nicolae Ciuca Government seeks to establish total state control over the way citizens move to cities, and even on the living space and the number of residents per hectare.

[...] Practically, everything will be done to travel as little as possible, as close to home and if, however, you will have this audacity, do it with public transport.""
NARRATIVES: In the near future, Romanians will be enslaved by the ecodictatorship imposed by the global occult in the name of combating climate change.
CONTEXT: A report published in January by the coalition for Combating Climate Disinformation and carried out by a team of experts coordinated by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, finds that, after the break forced by the Covid19 pandemic and the Russian aggression on Ukraine, in 2022 there was an explosive increase of climate denialism on social networks, as Veridica anticipated more than a year ago.
Most of the big cities around the world are facing an accelerated increase in air quality problems, which causes both concern, but also an increasing focus on finding viable solutions to combat this trend. The studies carried out show that approximately 20% of the excessive pollution of European cities is caused by the burning of fossil fuels used in transport. In Romania, the share of noxes released by vehicles is even twice as high, in Bucharest, for example, road traffic generates almost half of the amount of noxes present in the atmosphere, according to a 2020 report by the National Institute of Public Health. The presence of toxic gases in the air we breathe leads to various lung and heart diseases (asthma, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, disorders of the gastrointestinal system, ischemic heart disease, obstructive bronchopneumopathy, cerebrovascular accidents, mental and neurological diseases, diabetes, etc.), which cause death of thousands of Bucharest residents annually. In this context, the authorities are trying, through the draft law on sustainable urban mobility currently being debated in Parliament, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated by transport through ecological solutions and, at the same time, to contribute to improving the state of health of the population and to reduce the pressure on the health system and medical costs.
OBJECTIVE: The generation of social discontent and the decrease of the population's trust in the authorities, the reduction and even the stopping of actions that affect economic interests and businesses from polluting activities.
Atmospheric pollution is real and must be reduced as efficiently as possible, as quickly as possible
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In May 2021, the European Commission adopted an action plan at EU level, entitled ""Towards zero air, water and soil pollution"". According to it, the Commission will introduce stricter requirements to combat air pollution, through a series of measures and strategies within the European Green Deal, including sustainable and intelligent mobility. Previously, in December 2020, the Coalition was launched
""Climate education"", which will support the identification of innovative solutions to reduce pollution together with teachers and students, including regarding the development of green skills. Also, the Erasmus+ program will strengthen the green dimension in education and training and increase, among others, the number of opportunities for mobility in the field of urban planning. The legislative initiative of the Bucharest government does nothing but align the Romanian legislation with the entire set of European normative acts; in addition, the entry into force of the legislation on sustainable urban mobility is a foreseen milestone within the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, employed at the governmental level by Romania.
The implementation of the ""15-minute city"" concept does not imply in any case the reduction of the mobility of the population and its dependence on an exclusive public transport system of the state, but refers to an urban residential concept, which provides that most daily needs (food supply and medicines, visits to the family doctor, going to school, etc.) can be accomplished either by walking or by bicycle, in very short times. One of the main objectives of the implementation of this concept aims to reduce car traffic and, implicitly, the reduction of the pollution caused by them, in the urban space. In no way does it restrict the free movement of people, who are encouraged to use public transport, bicycles or walking when they have work in the city. The benefits of this lifestyle start from from having more free time available to those related to physical and mental health, cleaner air, quality green space and stronger ties with the community. For example, an area adapted to this concept becomes a much more favorable environment for the development of small local businesses that the sovereignists urge us to support.
The introduction of low-emission zones (ZNSE) is not a new idea, it was also under debate in 2019, in Bucharest, when, following a ""survey"" on Facebook, the project was withdrawn by the Capital City Hall, from an exaggerated populism of the mayor who was in office at the time. The comparison with the restriction of the circulation of passenger cars during the communist period is forced, the reasons behind the bans from that time being related to the absurd savings measures imposed by the Ceausescu regime. Currently, if it will be voted, the law will restrict the circulation of polluting cars, encouraging the renewal of the car fleet or the use of non-polluting means of transport. The statement that, in the absence of the implementation of legislation that would more firmly regulate road traffic in cities, the respective states will be sanctioned by reducing the allocated funds, actually refers to the strategy of encouraging such actions, through financial rewards, in the form of grants or non-reimbursable funds. Under no circumstances will the respective region or country be sanctioned financially.
The effects of the restriction of car traffic could be best seen in 2020, during the lockdowns caused by the Covid19 pandemic, which led, temporarily, to cleaner air and water, as well as to a reduced noise level in many places. However, the European authorities have repeatedly stated that the slowdown of all economic activities does not represent the Union's vision regarding the reduction of pollution, as the analyzed narrative suggests.

In reality, the respective website is a private project that tries to draw attention to people who support, in one way or another, the interests of Russia, regardless of the country they come from.
Propaganda: Ukraine will organize more and more assassinations, and the list of future victims is public
NEWS: ""The Ukrainian site Mirotvoret is a plan to kill people by the regime in Kiev, the official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zakharova, said during a program on Radio Sputnik, commenting on the killing in St. Petersburg of war correspondent Vladlen Tatarski.
The diplomat drew attention to the fact that Tatarski was included in the database of the Mirotvoret website, being periodically threatened with death.
""The Mirotvoret site is not one or two years old. All these public figures from the West and from here, who have just arrived, did not listen to our explanation in the past about what the respective site is, and now they have no excuse and cannot say that they did not know. They simply did not want to listen to our explanations. The Mirotvoret site is that very map, that very plan, that very program of extermination of people by the Kiev regime and its accomplices,"" Maria Zaharova said.
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian authorities will continue to assassinate people close to the Kremlin based on a list published on a website
Reality: The Ukrainian site Mirotvoret is not a ""blacklist"", but a database of people who threaten the security of Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova used the topic of the killing of pro-Kremlin blogger Vladlen Tatarski to once again blame Kiev for the attacks, saying that on the website Ukrainian Mirotvoret is publishing a ""black list"" of people who will be killed by the Ukrainian services. It claims that Vladlen Tatarski is on that website, that's why he was killed. It is not the first time that the Kremlin complains that Ukraine allows the publication of information about the people who collaborate with the Russian army or against whom there are certain suspicions.
In March, after the name of the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, accused of collaborating with Russia during the war in Ukraine, appeared on the website, the Russian Foreign Ministry mentioned that the website is a ""real list of people who should be shot, against whose nationalists took absolutely aggressive and monstrous measures"". At the same time, neither the OSCE, nor UNESCO, nor the international journalism organizations paid attention to this Ukrainian website, the Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out.
In fact, Moscow does not like the fact that the lesser-known networks of people from various countries, with which Russia collaborates, become visible and much more transparent following the publication of some information on this Ukrainian website. Russian propaganda claims that the people mentioned on this site will be assassinated. In reality, the site contains the names of dozens and hundreds of Ukrainians, along with Russians and other nationalities, suspected of facilitating Russian aggression. In January 2023, Oleksii Arestovich, the former adviser to the president of Ukraine, was included in this list after a statement regarding a series of explosions in the city of Dnipro, which became a topic of anti-Ukrainian discussions on Russian television stations. Arestovici resigned, but lives in Kiev and even announced the launch of a new political project, without fearing that he will be assassinated by someone. The site itself positions itself as a ""center for studies of signs of crimes against Ukraine's national security, peace, stability, international law and order"". Being founded by a former advisor to the Ministry of the Interior, Anton Gherascenko, civic activist and expert, the Mirotvoret site has become an information exchange network between journalists, politicians and researchers, who analyze the Russian-Ukrainian hybrid war and the supporters of Russia's false narratives.
For example, after Senator Diana Iovanovici-Sosoaca submitted a bill to the Romanian Parliament for the annexation of Ukrainian territories, the Mirotvoret Center requested the legal authorities to examine this information as ""a statement about the commission by this citizen of deliberate acts against the national security of Ukraine, peace, the security of mankind and international law and order, as well as other crimes"".
Since since 2014 the site has published information about thousands of Russian collaborators, the killing of some of them was used by the Kremlin as a basis to accuse Kiev of Nazism and terrorism. The only problem that sparked great discussions in Ukraine regarding the operation of this site is the publication of personal data. According to Anton Gherascenko, the site has the right to publish any information about persons suspected of betraying Ukraine's national interests under art. 17 of the Constitution regarding the defense of the territorial sovereignty of the country. The site has no direct connection with the Ukrainian authorities and cannot be classified as a ""blacklist"".
Regarding the murder of the Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarski, the case is being investigated as a ""crime of great interest"", according to the Russian authorities. At the same time, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mihailo Podolyak attributed the explosion to an ""internal political struggle"" in Russia, writing on Twitter that ""spiders eat each other in a jar"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the actions of the Ukrainian authorities. According to Russian propaganda, Ukraine recruits volunteers for Nazi brigades, while the actions of the Russian military in the Kherson region are an example of human behavior. The Russian press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. Also, according to Russian propaganda, half of the soldiers of the Ukrainian army are foreigners, which means that NATO is participating in the war, and the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine.

Fugitive oligarch: ""Extending the state of emergency means extending the thefts, abuses and illegalities of the Sandu-PAS regime""
NEWS: ""Approximately three million citizens of the Republic of Moldova are hostages of the state of emergency, established by the Sandu-PAS regime and extended every 60 days. Well done, Maia!

They instituted censorship on the Internet as well. Does this mean European integration, democracy and the rule of law? Extending the state of emergency means extending the thefts, abuses and illegalities of the Sandu-PAS regime.""
[...]
NARRATIVES: 1. The Chisinau government stole a billion euros that the Republic of Moldova received from the EU. 2. The authorities extend the state of emergency only to achieve their political and economic interests.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: A state of emergency is declared in the Republic of Moldova starting on February 24, 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine; after the expiration of the first period, the state of emergency was constantly extended by 60 days at the request of the Government with the consent of the Parliament. The measure was taken in the context in which the Republic of Moldova, which has over 1,200 km of common border with Ukraine, is considered the most vulnerable country in the region in case of an attack by the Russian Federation. At the beginning of the war, when few experts expected such strong resistance from the Ukrainian army, the Republic of Moldova, with an influential Russian-speaking minority and a pro-Moscow secessionist region, was considered Moscow's next target. Shortly after, a large number of Ukrainian refugees came to Moldova, a crisis that it managed very well, as noted by international organizations. The war in Ukraine caused inflation to rise up to 30% and an energy crisis, initially due to high prices, and in the fall of last year due to insufficient gas and electricity (as a result of the actions of Russia and/or the separatist regime from Tiraspol , which is supported by Russia).
Meanwhile, after a short slide among the Russian left, caused by the defeats in the elections of 2020 and 2021, but also by Russia's failures on the front in Ukraine, the Sor Party, led by the fugitive politician Ilan Sor, convicted by the first court in the robbery case banking of proportions since 2014, launched protest actions, which reached their peak in the fall, this being now considered the main political force managed by Moscow in the Republic of Moldova.
In the last two months, there is more and more talk, both in Chisinau and in Western chancelleries, about an alleged plan by Moscow to destabilize the internal situation of the Republic of Moldova, including through protest actions and hostage taking with the help of foreign mercenaries. The main organizer of these actions would be the Sor Party, advised by the FSB.
OBJECTIVE: To reduce the confidence of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova in the current pro-European government from Chisinau, which came to power with a strong message of the fight against corruption, justice reform and embracing European values. To divert attention from the problems with justice of Ilan Sor, convicted by the first court for participating in the theft of one billion dollars from the banking system, associating the government with the alleged robbery of one billion euros from the credits and grants offered by the West.
Reality: Moldova did not even receive one billion euros, and the state of emergency was extended due to security threats
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: First of all, the Republic of Moldova did not receive a billion euros from the EU, as Sor claims, quoted by some media institutions. According to the data provided by the Ministry of Finance at the end of last year, in 2022 the Republic of Moldova received financial assistance from all international partners in the amount of 671 million euros, with more than 800 million expected for 2023. In large part, this aid was allocated to cover part of the population's expenses for energy resources that have become more expensive several times, but also to cover the state's expenses for Ukrainian refugees.
The authorities introduced certain restrictions (such as the ban on blocking the streets on working days), but did not ban anti-government protests. The police detained people on whom prohibited objects were found and who allegedly prepared disturbances in the mass.
The state of emergency was extended in the context of ""persistent risks and threats aimed at national security, the supply of the Republic of Moldova with electricity, as well as acts of sabotage in the judiciary, which amplify attempts to destabilize the country and create impediments in the accession process of our country to the European Union"", according to Prime Minister Dorin Recean.
NUTS OF TRUTH: The state of emergency is extended in the Republic of Moldova starting with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Commission for Exceptional Situations adopted several decisions to reduce the risks to the security of the Republic of Moldova
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: ""The extension of the state of emergency is a necessary constitutional instrument, because we are still facing elements of a hybrid war of Russia against the Republic of Moldova, which is helped in one way or another by the group for theft and war , which has a clear mission - to destabilize the situation and create chaos. The Republic of Moldova, the state institutions will face these challenges, and those who participate, organize and incite such challenges, must know that they will be punished in the end"", said Prime Minister Dorin Recean.

In reality, the Russian military actually committed war crimes, and Germany is helping Ukraine defend itself.
Propaganda: Germany wants to destroy Russia so that it will no longer be considered guilty of the crimes committed in the Second World War
NEWS: ""The process of condemning Russia and its current regime must replace in the historical memory of mankind the former Nuremberg trial and erase the sense of German guilt for the crimes of the Nazis [...] There will already be another Germany, which will not she is still dominated by the feeling of guilt. [...]
They want to exhaust Russia as much as possible and, at the same time, to obtain as many reasons as possible to organize a new Nuremberg trial, that is, to defend a maximum number of precedents that can be considered war crimes, being created and the necessary image in the press.
The Germans have meanwhile become specialists in this, no worse than the British. What is broadcast on the German television stations after Bucea is a blatant lie, I do not recommend the Russians to watch those reports because your ears are withering and you want to cry [...]
In Germany we observe a real fascism. It is a special type of fascism, a ""green"" one that is closely related to Ukrainian Nazism.
NARRATIVE: Fascist Germany supports Ukraine to destroy Russia and forget the atrocities of the Second World War.
Reality: Germany is helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggressors who have committed numerous war crimes
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: Russian government media cites various experts from Moscow to prove that all accusations against Russia regarding war crimes committed by its military in Ukraine are false. According to Russian propaganda, an important role in this process is played by Germany, which would be led by a new type of fascists - ""greens"" -, has lost its sense of guilt for the crimes committed during the Second World War and wants them to be forgotten by condemning Russia in a new trial of the Nurnberg type.
This false narrative is a mixture of historical and current information. In reality, the Russian military committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, as shown by the traces found by the Ukrainian forces, including mass graves, in Bucea, Irpin, Borodeanka, Izium and other localities. Also, torture chambers were found in Bucea, Kherson and Nova Kahovka. At the same time, Russia killed numerous civilians in bombings of some residential areas, and this winter also carried out a campaign against the Ukrainian infrastructure by which millions of civilians were left in the cold and in the dark. All these actions contravene the international law regarding the conduct of wars, the EU and US leaders discussing the establishment of a special tribunal to judge the crimes committed by the Russians in Ukraine during the invasion launched by Vladimir Putin.
In mid-March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant in the name of Vladimir Putin, accusing him of committing war crimes in Ukraine. Prosecutor Karim Khan opened an investigation into the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine a year ago. In response, Russian politicians and the press from Moscow began to threaten the judges and tell the Russians that all the evidence is fabricated and the accusations - false.
Berlin became the target of Russian propaganda after the Minister of Justice, Marco Buschman, declared that he will have to implement the arrest warrant if Vladimir Putin visits Germany.
On the other hand, Berlin also supports Ukraine with ammunition and military equipment, including Leopard tanks, to help it resist the aggression of the Russian Federation. Berlin's actions are not directed against Russia and do not aim to destroy it, but according to international law, Ukraine has every right to defend itself and receive help to do so.
Having fewer and fewer logical arguments regarding the decisions made by Berlin and the International Criminal Court, Russian propaganda brings to the surface for the internal public opinion various historical arguments about Germany's desire to take revenge on Russia for the defeat in the Second World War, emphasizing the links, ""fascist"" German leaders with ""Ukrainian Nazis"".
Nazism and fascism are banned both in Ukraine and in Germany, being a painful topic especially in the latter. As Veridica showed, back in 2015 Nazi and communist ideology was banned in Ukraine. The Russian press traditionally catalogs nationalist and identity manifestations from the ex-Soviet space as forms of Nazism/fascism, without noticing that neo-Nazism and extremism are widespread ideological currents in Russia, including in its army, becoming instruments of Kremlin control and manipulation over society through the mass media.
Even if they try to justify Moscow's actions in Ukraine with historical arguments, the Russian press does not tell the whole truth and does not mention anything about the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, which makes the Soviet Union as guilty of starting the Second World War as Nazi Germany. During the signing of this pact, which also contained an additional secret protocol, the Moscow airport terminal and the buildings visited by German diplomats were decorated with the famous flags with the German swastika.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about Nazism in Ukraine and in the West. The Russian press also wrote that Zelenski has secret ties with the Nazis. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press demonstrates that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about holding back Moscow when it bombed Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians would not They support the Nazi leaders in Kiev According to the Russian government media, because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are being liberated by Russia.

- And the question is when will this end?""
The characters described not flatteringly in the transcription of this audio recording are Russian President Vladimir Putin and his acolyte, former President Dmitry Medvedev, and the voices of the interlocutors - apparently in full agreement - have been identified as prominent supporters of the despot from the Kremlin: Iosif Prigozhin, well-known music producer and supporter of the annexation of Crimea, and Farhad Ahmedov, a billionaire former senator of the Krasnodar region. The telephone conversation was allegedly recorded in January and was initially published by the Ukrainian television Channel 5, causing astonishment in Moscow and inevitably coming to the attention of the FSB Federal Security Service. For more than half an hour, the interlocutors compete in profanity-strewn criticism of the way in which Putin and his close circle manage the war in Ukraine.

Shortly after the recording became viral, Iosif Prigojin vehemently denied its authenticity, accusing it of a deepfake work and reaffirming his loyalty to Putin.
I.P.: ,,(It is) a fake recording that claims to present my voice and a conversation with an influential character was distributed online. When I listened to the recording, I almost thought it was me. Of course, it's unpleasant to know that my voice is circulating on the Internet""
Later, Prigojin admitted that some phrases belonged to him, but he insisted that he no longer remembers the conversation in question. Meanwhile, the publication Important Stories, citing a source from the Russian special services, claims that the FSB has confirmed the validity of the recording and is preparing measures accordingly.
Putin ""hunts"" his opponents with American technology
reuters.com / 28 Mar. 2023
It is no longer a secret that the Russian government uses facial recognition to monitor its citizens. As early as 2017, Moscow announced the launch of one of the largest facial recognition video networks in the world. At that time, more than 3,000 of the 160,000 cameras installed in the Russian capital were connected to the system that allows identification based on the biometric characteristics of the figure. After checking more than 2,000 cases before the Moscow courts, Reuters journalists found that the respective cameras played an important role in hundreds of arrests. The files show that most of those sent before the judges in 2021 were detained for participating in the anti-government protests. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia brought a change: the authorities began to use facial recognition not only to identify and sanction those who express their dissatisfaction in the street, but also preventively, to prevent them from doing it. It has come to the point that people whose image is in the database are detained at will by law enforcement on national holidays, when protests usually occur, or when Russians' anti-war sentiments are on the rise, as happened last September, on the occasion of the partial mobilization. 28 of the 29 people stopped at the subway interviewed by Reuters confirmed that, according to the police, the measure was a consequence of the use of facial recognition. 14 identified the video analysis system called ""Sphere"", which uses the technology of the American company VisionLabs. Among those detained were students, pensioners, a scientist, a university researcher and a courier. Some were coming or going to work. A man was going to the theater with his wife and children. A woman accompanied her sick mother to the doctor. They all had in common the critical attitude towards the Kremlin and, some of them, previous participation in anti-government protests. In the Moscow metro, facial recognition is part of the platform access system. When they pass through the entrance gates, the passengers are photographed and an algorithm compares their faces with the images in the database. The system warns when a traveler is on the watch list. The police response comes after a few seconds or minutes. Of the four companies that provide the algorithms for the system's operation, at least three use chips manufactured by the American companies Nvidia Corp or Intel Corp. Contacted by Reuters, the managements of both companies stated that they stopped supplies to Russia in March last year, immediately after the introduction of export restrictions by the United States. However, the customs documents consulted by journalists show that, between April 1 and October 31, 2022, at least 129 shipments of the Nvidia brand arrived in Russia through third parties. Of these, 57 contained graphic processing units indispensable for the proper functioning of the facial recognition system used as a repressive measure by the Kremlin.
""Deepfake"" technology - a real threat
theweek.co.uk / 27 Mar. 2023; atlantico.fr / 29 Mar. 2023; thetimes.co.uk / 29 Mar. 2023
The avalanche of deepfake images poured into the virtual space in recent weeks is causing concern among sociologists, journalists and politicians, and even among IT specialists. The impact generated by the digital composition of the voice or image of real characters then transposed into fictitious poses proves that, used in bad faith or just without discernment, technological progress can give an aura of credibility to any fake, no matter how harmful. What a few years ago seemed just a hi-tech joke of some initiatives useful to the entertainment industry has become, through the multitude of increasingly sophisticated and accessible applications, a potential threat to democracy and society. Experts in cyber security point out that the distribution of these extremely realistic Artificial Intelligence products can, like other forms of online disinformation, have extreme consequences. Deepfakes can cause dramatic changes in financial markets, overturn the results of democratic elections, turn an innocent into a criminal, and ruin otherwise unassailable reputations. In other words, it generates catastrophic effects with costs that have become minimal today. The easy acceptance of deepfake products is favored by ignorance and credulity. For example, although there is a growing category of Internet users, too few of them are aware of or understand what Artificial Intelligence means and its pitfalls. A large part of the public tends to give credit to any information from sources they consider legitimate for the simple reason that it is present on the phone, computer or television screen. At the same time, the inability to distinguish fiction from reality has the perverse effect of declining public trust in the media, a handicap that is difficult to recover. On the other hand, the inadequacy of the regulations to reality and the lack of ethical norms are also signaled in the open letter by which thousands of IT experts requested on March 29 a moratorium of at least six months in the field of artificial intelligence, citing ""major risks for humanity"".

They quote a false narrative published by a far-left German newspaper that has close ties to the Russian press.
Propaganda: The German press discovered Zelensky's true connections with the Nazi leaders in Ukraine
NEWS: ""One of the goals of the special operation in Ukraine is denazification. However, Kiev's Western allies and sponsors do not notice the Nazis in Ukraine [...]
The German publication ""Junge Welt"" recently published an investigation about the Nazi origins of the Ukrainian leadership, showing who is really the master of the country. [...] The German authors used in their investigation, among other things, materials from the publication Ukraina.ru.
Some Western politicians were embarrassed by Zelenski's appearance together with a neo-Nazi soldier from ""Azov"" (an organization declared terrorist and banned in Russia) during a video address to the Greek parliament [...].
In March 2022, the group ""Pravii sektor"" (Right Sector), led by Dmytro Iaros, which had previously been an illegal armed formation, was integrated into the Ukrainian army or represented the core of the 67th separate mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In this how the neo-Nazi military gained access to modern western weapons.
The President of Ukraine and the Verkhovna Rada are now spokesmen and assistants of neo-Nazi structures such as ""Azov"". [...] Without these neo-Nazi structures, as the German authors write, Ukraine's ""proxy war machine"" directed against Russia it will stop. [...]
The Nazis were legalized (with the approval of the NATO and EU leadership) by including their formations in the National Guard, the Security Service of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine.""
NARRATIVE: An investigation by the German media proves that Zelenski has connections with the Nazis.
Reality: Nazi ideology and symbols are banned in Ukraine, and the German media investigation is a retelling of Russian propaganda narratives
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the German press that allegedly discovered Volodymyr Zelensky's lesser-known ties to Ukrainian neo-Nazis ""informally supported by the West"" is, in fact, a lesser-known newspaper that collaborated with the government press Russian in recent years. The ""Junge Welt"" newspaper, of Marxist orientation, is considered in Germany to be of the extreme left, continuing the German communist traditions.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ""Junge Welt"" published a series of articles copying the false narratives of Russian propaganda. Most of the time, the German newspaper is quoted by the Moscow press to illustrate its own false narratives or present them as an independent point of view. At the end of November 2022, Ukraina.ru, quoting ""Junge Welt"", wrote without providing any concrete evidence that Ukrainian refugees beat the residents of Berlin who speak Russian, and in December - that Zelenski wants to make money during the war and does not care about the suffering of civilians.
The investigation cited by the Russian press is based 90 percent on various propaganda narratives from the past. ""Junge Welt"" quotes articles from Ukraina.ru in this investigation, and the Russian news portal writes about the ""great discovery"" in Germany regarding the Nazi origins of Ukrainian leaders.
In fact, the text published by ""Junge Welt"" and Ukraina.ru does not resemble an investigation. Zelenski is accused of being around some leaders of the ""Azov"" military group, which means he is a Nazi; that he included former nationalist fighters in the regular Ukrainian army; that it is led by the Nazis with the tacit consent of the West, which pretends not to notice these ""followers of Hitlerism"". It is, in fact, an opinion article, and not an investigation because it does not present any evidence that prove that Zelenski is a Nazi or that he is a ""puppet of neo-Nazis"".
Moreover, the Russian press does not mention anything about the prohibition of Nazi and communist ideology in Ukraine in 2015, which provides for criminal liability for the promotion of neo-Nazism. The appearance of Zelensky in a video message with a soldier from the ""Azov"" group or the inclusion of this regiment in the regular Ukrainian army does not mean the legalization of Nazism, on the contrary, it is an attempt to bring all armed groups under the control of the government.
According to the Israeli analyst, originally from Russia, Viacheslav Lihaciov, specialist in extremist movements, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and the study of the Holocaust, there is no scientific basis for calling the ""Azov"" group Nazi or neo-Nazi. The expert considers that Ukraine's decision to take under control all groups of combatants and to subordinate them to the National Guard. Also, ""Azov"" bravely defended the inhabitants of the city of Mariupol, bombed and destroyed by the Russian army in the spring of last year. The specialist analyzed for four years the contacts between the representatives of the ""Azov"" group with the Jewish and Muslim communities in Mariupol, noting that no problem was identified. The ""Azov"" regiment signed up for the launch of the large-scale invasion of Russia against Ukraine, representatives of several ethnic groups, including Russophones from the east of the country.
Being a structure subordinate to the Ukrainian army, the interaction of Ukrainian political leaders with ""Azov"" is not proof of their neo-Nazi attitudes. The Russian press frequently categorizes nationalist (or even identity) manifestations in the ex-Soviet space as forms of Nazism/fascism. In reality, according to international experts, neo-Nazism and extremism are very important ideological currents in Russia, and especially in the Russian army, becoming instruments of control and manipulation of the Kremlin over society through the mass media.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding neo-Nazism in Ukraine and in the West. A year after the launch of the large-scale invasion, the Russian press wrote that the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The false narrative was often promoted about Moscow's restraint when bombing Ukraine, knowing that the Ukrainians they do not support the Nazi leaders in Kiev According to the Russian government media, because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are being liberated by Russia.

The false narrative appears in a text published in Romania, which also contains elements of war propaganda promoted by Moscow.
Narrative: global warming does not exist, it is only a pretext for the West to ensure its dominance
NEWS: ""According to the information contained in the document, the whole theory of green energy is false. The report considers it the ""last lie of the West"", the lie designed to lure resource-rich states into a deadly trap. The green industry, says the report, has developed in an absolutely wrong way, being more polluting than classical industry. Moreover, the supported conclusion of the experts and scientists who participated in the elaboration of the report was that the classic industry has the power not to pollute and to recover its waste, something that it has been demonstrating in recent times. On the other hand, the ""new ""green industry"" proves to be much more polluting than the old industry, but this pollution is sustained in the name of a ""hypothetical better future"". the raw materials existing in the Western states and the development of the states outside the Western sphere, which thus put pressure on the ""Western primacy"". Thus, it became necessary to take over by force and deception the resources available from countries not aligned with Western politics, and this could be done by generating colorful revolutions and destabilizing power. Since recently such actions have become insufficient, the West has set up a new and last farce, that of green development. Through the development of the ""green industry"", the West wanted to deceive the world that it has the ""magical source"" of energy that will break its dependence on the raw materials of non-Western countries. Also, the ""perspective"" was intended to impose surcharges and make the enemies stupid, who would thus enter the green race unprepared, having to buy western junk technology against valuable raw materials [...]""
NARRATIVES: 1. Global warming actually represents the attempt of the Western powers to get their hands on the resources of other states. 2. The implementation of ""green"" policies will lead to the enslavement of the population and the imposition of a worldwide dictatorship. 3. The ""green"" agenda of the European Union foreshadowed the war in Ukraine, the final goal being the defeat of Russia, its dismemberment and the distribution of its resources between western countries.
CONTEXT: A report published in January by the Coalition to Combat Climate Disinformation and carried out by a team of experts coordinated by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, states that in 2022 there was an explosive increase in climate denialism on social networks. Veridica anticipated more than a year ago the new conspiracy trend, which was forced to take a break, forced by the Covid19 pandemic and the Russian aggression on Ukraine.
Dan Diaconu, who wrote that he had heard about the existence of the report, admitted that he had not read it but commented, however, on its side, he was noticed in 2018, when he stated that the fire in the Colectiv club in 2015 was a ""fact occult"", and that the president of the country would not have been a stranger to this fact. Its purpose would have been to overthrow the government and install a facade with the task of making Romania available to the world occult. Dan Diaconu's personal blog, which is recommended to be an economic analyst, is a conglomeration of conspiracy theories, fake news and disinformation related to most current topics (pandemic, anticovid vaccine, climate change, etc.), as well as articles in which Russia is considered a model state and aggression his influence on Ukraine is appreciated, and people close to the Kremlin, such as the Putinist ideologue Aleksandr Dughin or the head of the Wagner mercenaries, Evgeni Prigozhin, are quoted, praised and admired.
OBJECTIVE: The generation of social discontent and the decrease of the population's trust in the authorities, the reduction and even the stopping of actions that affect economic interests and businesses from polluting activities, as well as exonerating Russia and presenting it as a victim forced to defend itself, and the construction of a parallel geopolitical reality, in which the West is the main culprit of the war in Ukraine.
Reality: green energy, a priority for combating climate change
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: As climate change - caused by human activities and, above all, greenhouse gas emissions, which lead to global warming - became more and more visible, combating them became a priority. In December 2015, 196 UN member states signed the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change. Its main purpose is to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels. For this, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by at least 43% until 2030. As more than 50% of these emissions are caused by the burning of fossil fuels for the production of electricity and thermal energy, the agreement provides for the gradual abandonment of this mode of production energy. The hypothesis that, after investing tens of billions of euros in the production of energy from renewable sources, the West will return to fossil fuels, is as absurd as it is improbable.
The share of ""green"" energy in the Western energy mix is ​​approximately 25%, constantly increasing from year to year, new production capacities being put into operation every year. And even if China is the largest producer of wind turbines and solar panels in the world, this did not at all imply the bankruptcy of German manufacturers or the cessation of the production of specialized equipment by countries with an already developed industry in the field, such as Denmark, Germany, Spain or the USA. In addition, if the European Union had plans taking over by force the oil and its derivatives from other countries, the measure that aims to stop the production of polluting cars until 2035 and the granting of tax facilities for the purchase of electric cars, would be not only ridiculous, but downright bankrupt.
The narrative of enslaving the planet's population in the name of fighting climate change is not new at all; Over time, Veridica dismantled several such fake news, such as those in which it is stated that the ecodictatorship will push humanity towards a feudal social system, or that people will have to pay to be able to breathe. In principle, at the base of these narratives is the fear that the fight against climate change will impoverish the population, who will not be able to afford the costs of producing ""green"" energy. There is also the fear that a strong campaign to combat the effects of global warming led by governments it could disregard people's economic freedoms, and the state would become too powerful in relation to civil society.
The idea that the EU's ""green"" agenda actually represents an extremely elaborate plan to defeat Russia is nothing more than a reformulation of the narrative used by Moscow that the West attacked Russia through Ukraine. And although Putin's regime forces, through self-victimization, diverting attention from the true purpose of the invasion, the conquest of some territories and the economic domination of Ukraine, it was not the West that triggered and maintained this conflict, but the very presence of Moscow's troops on Ukrainian territory is an act of war. The decision of the European Union to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources can only be interpreted as a hostile act in the twisted logic of the Kremlin, ""forced"" to fight a new war for the defense of the homeland, after having ""prevented"" the invasion of a NATO-Ukraine Nazi coalition in Russia.

She commented on a speech by the president from Chisinau, Maia Sandu, in which she drew attention to the dangers and threats from Russia in the context of the war in Ukraine.
NEWS: Moldova made a counterproductive choice in favor of provoking anti-Russian hysteria, without demonstrating its readiness for dialogue with Moscow, the spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zaharova, told RIA Novosti.
""Just recently, on March 17, President Maia Sandu, addressing the parliament, allowed himself baseless fabrications about ""Kremlin agents"" and about Russia's desire to ""bring war to Moldova"". On the same day, speaking on television, she, referring to the legally insignificant decision of the International Criminal Court, promoted by the West, reached the point of direct slander, claiming that the Russian leadership is personally guilty of the war crimes committed in Ukraine,"" the diplomat recalled.
Zakharova emphasized that the responsibility for war crimes rests with the Ukrainian authorities and ""everyone is convinced of this every day"".
""The murderers (we remind especially the decision-makers from Moldova) are those who walk in the uniform of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, brag about the symbols of the criminal nationalist Bandera battalions copied from the German Nazis, give - since 2014 - criminal orders regarding the destruction of civilian installations and the killing of civilians in Donbass, and today in Zaporozhye and the Kherson region, and they carry out such orders"", explained the official representative of the (Russian) Ministry of Foreign Affairs"". NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European government in Chisinau promotes a Russophobic policy. 2. It is not the Russian army that commits war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian army.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The pro-European government in Chisinau has condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine since its first days. Chisinau-Moscow relations deteriorated during the last year, in the context in which the war had direct consequences on the Republic of Moldova. The country was faced with an energy crisis and economic problems, but also with a security crisis, as its airspace was overrun by Russian missiles and fragments of them fell on its territory.
Criticisms from one side and the other have intensified in the last month. after the authorities from Chisinau, Kiev, but also international officials spoke about an alleged plan by Moscow to destabilize the internal situation in the Republic of Moldova, with the aim of establishing a pro-Russian government. Moscow accused the Chisinau government of trying to get closer to NATO, violating the neutrality status, violating the rights of the Russian-speaking minority. The Kremlin ended up criticizing Chisinau because the Parliament decided (as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in 2013) to replace the name of the language from Moldovan to Romanian.
In the context of the insecurity caused by the war, the Republic of Moldova strengthened its relations with the West, and in June 2022 it obtained, together with Ukraine, the status of a candidate country for joining the European Union, which once again caused the displeasure of Moscow, which, in the first through the spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zaharova, criticized any approach between Chisinau and Brussels.
Regarding the second narrative, Moscow tried during the war, especially after the appearance in the public space of the images showing the traces of the massacres in the Ukrainian cities north of Kiev, committed by the Russian army, to inoculate the idea that in fact the Ukrainians are the who commit war crimes.
OBJECTIVE: To present the Republic of Moldova (through its pro-European government) as an ""unfriendly"" state (term used by Kremlin rhetoric) in order, on the one hand, to strengthen the narrative that Russia is fighting against the ""collective West"" "", and on the other hand, to justify actions against Chisinau. To distract attention from the war crimes committed by the Russian forces.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Despite Moscow's open support for the pro-Russian forces in the Republic of Moldova - for example, Vladimir Putin openly supported Igor Dodon in the presidential elections - the pro-European government in Chisinau opted for strengthening relations with Russia, as it also demonstrates the activity program of the Gavrilita government.
Chisinau condemned the Russian invasion, but did not officially join the sanctions imposed on Russia by the international community. However, Gazprom did not deliver the necessary volume of gas to the Republic of Moldova, in accordance with the contractual provisions, during the cold period.
The authorities from Chisinau, but also from other states, spoke about the existence of Moscow's plans to destabilize the internal situation of the Republic of Moldova and to replace the government. Recently in Chisinau, the anti-government protests led by the party of the oligarch Ilan Sor, about whom the press wrote that he maintains close relations with the influential official in the Russian presidential administration, Dmitri Peskov, were resumed.
It is not very clear the context in which the comment of the spokeswoman of the Russian MFA appeared on March 24. Apparently, this referred to statements made by Maia Sandu exactly one week earlier. On March 17, the president of the Republic of Moldova gave a speech in Parliament in which he referred to the priorities of the Republic of Moldova during its European journey and in which he condemned Russia's plans to destabilize the country. However, she did not have Russophobic messages.
Later, being asked by the public television channel about the decision of the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant in the name of Vladimir Putin, Maia Sandu stated that this ""confirms the fact that [Putin] is personally guilty of war crimes committed in Ukraine"". So, she refers to the decision of an international court, but does not accuse the Kremlin leader, as the spokeswoman of the Russian MFA claims.
The so-called denazification of Ukraine was one of the reasons invoked by Putin for the invasion of Ukraine. It is a narrative used by Russia since 2014, when Kiev chose the path of European integration.
Without bringing any argument for the false statements regarding Nazism in Ukraine, both the Russian press and the high-ranking politicians in Moscow want to generate negative emotions in the post-Soviet collective mind. It should be noted that in Ukraine the ""Law on the Condemnation of Communist and Nazi Totalitarian Regimes and Their Symbolism"" was adopted, while in Russia the rehabilitation of Stalinism is currently taking place. In Russian history textbooks, the very important role of Joseph Stalin in the consolidation of the Soviet Union and the idea that Stalin committed crimes ""out of historical necessity"" is accredited.
After the discovery of the massacres in several Ukrainian cities, the Russian press launched a series of accusations that the Ukrainian army had committed war crimes. Veridica has, moreover, dismantled several propaganda articles in this regard. In June, the pro-Kremlin press wrote that the Ukrainian army is massacring Russian speakers during the withdrawal from Donbass, and in July - that Volodymyr Zelenski will be tried for war crimes in Ukraine. When the international community was shocked by the atrocities of the Russian military in the Kiev region, the Russian press misinformed the readers/viewers, reporting about a group of American experts who would have proved that the murders in Bucea were an invention of ""Ukrainian propaganda"". Then , the Russian press distributed another false narrative, writing that Ukraine invited experts from France who work on hiding the evidence of war crimes committed by the Ukrainian army in Bucea.

In reality, the weapons purchased under the ""Gift for Putin"" project are intended to strengthen Ukrainian defense against Russian aggression.
Propaganda: Czech volunteers give Ukraine a rocket launcher to kill civilians in Donbass
NEWS: ""Volunteers from the Czech Republic collected 1.2 million euros for the purchase of the RM-70 Vampire missile launcher, offered to the Ukrainian army. With this system, the Armed Forces of Ukraine bomb the residential areas of the districts of Donetsk"", according to DNR NEWS, which presents the help offered by the Czechs to Kiev as a gesture directed against the Russophones of Donbass.
""Donetsk was bombed with the Czechoslovak RM-70 Vampire system. Fragments of the respective ammunition were found. At least five houses were damaged in Kievski district of Donetsk as a result of the morning bombings. [...] It is a multiple launch missile system manufactured during Czechoslovakia"", writes the Russian newspaper ""Komsomolskaia Pravda"", emphasizing that the military equipment was offered to Ukraine for it to destroy.
NARRATIVE: The Czechs offered Ukraine a missile launcher so that it could bomb civilians in Donbass.
Reality: Within the ""Gift for Putin"" initiative, Czech citizens raised money to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Reacting to the numerous requests of the Ukrainian authorities to the West, the Czech businessman Dalibor Dedek launched the ""Gift for Putin"" project in May of last year with the aim of supporting Ukraine. The money collected goes to the account of the Ukrainian embassy at Prague and, under the auspices of the Czech Ministry of Defence, are used to purchase military equipment from Czech manufacturers and suppliers in accordance with the requirements of the Ukrainian military.In the past, the Czechs have bought the Tomas tank or the Viktor air defense system for the Ukrainian military.
They are purchases of small proportions, but which represent a symbolic gesture of support for Ukraine's defense efforts against the military aggression of the Russian Federation. The collection of funds is carried out with the aim of demonstrating the solidarity of the Czech society towards the sufferings of the Ukrainian people; in the first 4 hours of the collection, the Czechs collected 85 thousand euros for a rocket launcher.
In order to discredit this initiative and block similar ones in different countries of the world, the press from Moscow, but also from the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, distributed a false narrative, according to which the Czech volunteers provide Ukraine with a rocket launcher to contribute to the killing of civilians in Donbass.
On the day when the organizers of the ""Gift for Putin"" project announced the purchase of the missile launcher, the Donetsk press wrote about the bombing of residential areas in Donbass from a similar launcher, which Ukraine received from the Czech Republic last year, and most of the articles the press presented the Czech donors as accomplices of the crimes committed against Russian speakers.
In reality, according to the Czech media, the project is a symbol of condemnation of Russian aggression and support for the legitimate defensive efforts of the Ukrainian people who are waging a war of liberation. Each time, the superiority of Russia in terms of equipment and ammunition compared to Ukraine is mentioned in the Czech press.
The narrative aims to manipulate public opinion, showing that the war in Ukraine is launched and fueled by the West, being directed primarily against Russian speakers in Donbass.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives. According to Russian propaganda, the ""special military operation"" saved Russia from NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism. The United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. Russian government media also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine, but it is forced to do it to defend itself. Starting from November 2021, the Russian press wrote that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself from a NATO aggression, being forced to save Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West .

Russia's secret plan to subjugate the Republic of Moldova
expressen.se / Mar. 15 2023;
The recent disclosure of the secret strategy to destabilize the Republic of Moldova developed by the Russian Security Service (FSB) once again proves the gap between public statements and the real intentions of the Kremlin regarding the neighboring countries. The document - obtained by a group of publications, including Yahoo News, Delfi - Estonia, Expressen - Sweden, Sud Deutsche Zeitung and Rise Moldova - was developed in 2021 under the title ""Strategic objectives of the Russian Federation in the Republic of Moldova"" and describes five pages the directions of action for gradually bringing Chisinau into Moscow's sphere of influence. Among the immediate objectives is the preservation of the situation in Transnistria, including maintaining the Russian military presence and blocking any attempt by the Moldovan government to normalize the situation. The priority for the Kremlin administration is to ensure the unfettered activity of Russian and pro-Russian publications, as well as the creation and support of a network of pro-Russian non-governmental organizations on the territory of the republic. One of the targets until 2025 is to encourage attitudes favorable to Russia, both at the level of the entire electorate and at the level of the elites, simultaneously with undermining the collaboration of the Republic of Moldova with NATO and Romania. For the Kremlin's strategies, both the obstruction of the so-called ""Romanization policy"" of the population and the maintenance of education in the Russian language in schools are important. Preserving the dependence of the republic on Russian gas is identified as the main objective in the economic field. According to the document, in Moldova in 2030, the pro-Russian influential groups should be stable, and the share of decision-makers with a negative attitude towards NATO substantial. In the same year, the Russian language should become the main language of interethnic communication, and the Russian press should be omnipresent. How regarding the economic field, the FSB document predicts that by the end of the decade, the volume of Chisinau's transactions within the Eurasian Economic Union will increase, to the detriment of commercial exchanges with the West.
The war in Ukraine and the Russian-Chinese ""International"" of disinformation
csmonitor.com / 22 Mar. 2023; rferl.org / 6 Mar. 2023
The visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Moscow confirms the conjunctural rapprochement between the two countries more than a year after the invasion of Ukraine. The study recently published by the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy finds that the messages of Chinese officials and the media have evolved throughout the war, providing increasing coverage for the Kremlin's rhetoric, despite Beijing's declared neutrality. According to the report, the pro-Russian convergence was achieved by China taking over the key directions of Russian propaganda, in parallel with minimizing the war crimes of the Russians. Thus, the Chinese press avoided using the word ""invasion"", choosing - according to the Kremlin's terminology - the expression ""special operation"". In many cases, Chinese publications have taken over the disinformation and conspiracy theories promoted by the Russian press, from the fake biological weapons produced by the Americans in Ukraine to the fantasy thesis of staging the Bucea massacre. Between February 24, 2022 and the current January 23, the Twitter accounts of Chinese diplomats and state media cited Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov three times more than his Ukrainian counterpart Dmitro Kuleba. In the same period, Vladimir Putin received eight times more mentions than Volodymyr Zelensky. Another discrepancy noted by analysts is that, in the mentioned interval, the negative messages of the same sources targeted NATO, although until the invasion of Ukraine the alliance was not a favorite target of the Chinese media.
Russian propaganda disguised as ""fact checking""
time.com / 15 Mar. 2023; logically.ai / 15 Mar. 2023
Disinformation specialists consider the ""War on fakes"" to be the most successful online propaganda campaign launched by Russia immediately after the invasion of Ukraine. Statistics show that the popular Telegram channel, which claims to offer ""objective"" and ""non-parasitic"" checks "" of information about the conflict, attracted a million followers in the first week, quickly reaching 20 million daily views. The amalgam of allegedly verified statements, converging with Kremlin scenarios, consistent support for the actions of the Russian army, blaming opponents for atrocities against civilians were frequently quoted on the accounts of the Russian rulers and the preachers of Moscow's messages. After more than a year of war, the British company Logically, specialized in detecting online disinformation, identified the man behind the ""War on fakes"" as Timofei Vasiliev, a former Russian journalist who worked in organizations close to the Kremlin and who currently produces the column ""Fake control"" in the show of propagandist Vladimir Solovyov from the most popular state television channel. British analysts detected Vasiliev's connection with the Rossia 1 channel after his name, phone number and e-mail address came to their attention when the registration data of the ""War on fakes"" website was updated. Contacted by journalists to Time magazine, Vasiliev refused to comment.
The Russian-Ukrainian ""War"" in the museums of the world
smithsonianmag.com / Mar. 23 2023; lemonde.com / Mar. 17 2023;
Russia registers a significant loss of prestige in front of Ukraine in the catalogs and on the screens of the great museums of the world. On February 10, the famous Metropolitan Art in New York recognized the Ukrainian identity of the painters Arhip Kuidji and Ilia Repin, presented until now as Russian artists. The correction, carried out at the request of historians, was considered a first step of a so-called ""decolonization of Ukrainian art"". A week later, the Musee D'Orsay in Paris organized a round table dedicated to Russian painters, ignoring - despite the requests - the Ukrainian identity of the same painters and thus exposing themselves to accusations that they were an instrument of Russian propaganda. Ilia Repin and Arhip Kuidji were born on Ukrainian territory in the era when Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire. The fact that they graduated from the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Saint Petersburg - the only possibility at that time to pursue an artistic career - did not make them break ties with Ukraine, where they often returned, as the subjects of their works testify. Another case of ""decolonization of art"" is that of Edgar Degas' thematic series of pastels depicting women dancing in Ukrainian folk costumes, known as ""Russian Dancers"". Last year, London's National Gallery rectified the title of a work in ""Ukrainian dancers"", because last month Metropolitan New York also renamed a painting from its own collection.

70,572,The USA rules Romania and is waging war against Russia,Romania is his puppet state.,False,[],"['USA', 'Romania', 'Russia']",,,,,,,https://solidnews.ro/externe/2023/03/20/adrian-severin-scrisoare-deschisa-exploziva-catre-ambasadoarea-sua/,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-sua-conduce-romania-si-poarta-razboi-impotriva-rusiei,,23.03.2023,,Romania,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-sua-conduce-romania-si-poarta-razboi-impotriva-rusiei,,"The USA leads Romania, wants to destroy the EU and is waging war against Russia, according to a series of false narratives promoted by the criminally convicted ex-Romanian foreign minister, Adrian Severin. The narratives appear in a letter addressed by the criminal politician to the new US ambassador to Romania, Kathleen Kavalec.
Romania is ruled by Americans
NEWS: ,,[...] The USA is not negotiating anything in and with Romania. Everything is for free. It includes the perspectives of our national reunification, of reparing our damages suffered in the 1941-1944 war lost to the USSR [...], of obtaining security guarantees in the relationship with a neighbor from the east whom it is arming and awakening the appetite for a regional protagonist, obliging us to support him with all our forces, even though he was always hostile to us with all his forces and indoctrinated his society with anti-Romanian narratives. Let's be clear! ""Slava Ukraini!"" is not the Romanian agenda. [...] it is necessary to recall the nefarious role played by the USA through the so-called ""support"" granted for the reform of the Romanian judicial system and the fight against corruption. [...] The crossing of the secret services with justice led in Romania to the birth of a real underground state that liquidated the national elites in all fields - political, economic, academic, technical, medical, artistic, sports, etc. If today the electoral offer of the political parties is derisory, if the national capital has almost completely disappeared, if the sporting performances of the Romanians are embarrassing, if the universities produce impostors on the treadmill and if all this has made stupidity and incompetence the worst form of corruption from Romania, the ""merit"" is, overwhelmingly, of the American ""help"". [...] the war between the USA and Russia waged through and on the territory of Ukraine has the EU as a collateral victim, if not as the main target. This is achieved by severing the EU from cheap Russian energy sources and the Russian market, by destroying the mutually beneficial interdependence with Russia, which has been worked on for decades, by drying up the military arsenals of the Western and Central European states, as well as by transforming EU from soft power to hard power. [...] Romania does not want to reissue a Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, aware that the signatories of that agreement accidentally gave their name to a perennial German strategy.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The USA dictates Bucharest's policy, both internally and especially externally. 2. The United States is guilty of the birth of a real ""parallel state"" in Romania, which liquidated the national elites in all areas. 3. The Russian-American war on the territory of Ukraine aims to destroy the European Union. 4. The USA is at war with Russia and also brought Romania into the conflict 5. The Ribbentrop - Molotov Pact was an exclusively German strategy.
CONTEXT: Adrian Severin is a former Romanian foreign minister and MEP caught while accepting bribes for influence peddling and sentenced to prison for this. After his release, he began to constantly promote sovereignist and anti-Western theses, similar to those that appear in the narratives spread by the Kremlin. After the start of the invasion in Ukraine, the ex-detainee even continued to take over several theses of the Russian war propaganda. For some time, the ex-politician turned criminal has been expressing his opinions on solidnews and in the broadcasts of the radio station associated with this portal, Gold FM, a station sanctioned for spreading false information by the CNA. Both media channels are associated with Cozmin Gusa, a controversial politician/analyst/consultant/businessman who has promoted false narratives over time and has been described by the Romanian press as a Russian close/sympathizer/agent of influence. This letter is not the first that Severin addresses to an American ambassador. In 2015, the US ambassador at that time, Hans Klemm, was the recipient of an almost identical letter, minus the part about the war in Ukraine, which was at that time in the phase of regional conflict, with Russia not assuming any involvement. In that letter, Adrian Severin states, assuming the role of the people's spokesperson, that Romanians have come to prefer Russia to America, as ""the optimal solution for their survival as a free nation"". In May 2021, the former minister addressed another letter , this time to Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov, in which, among other things, he affirms his conviction that Romania and Russia have several common strategic interests, and that Romanian culture is incompatible with Western civilization, which has offered Romania nothing but the ""doubtful the privilege of being its market and land-airport"". We also remind, for a better contextualization of the ideas expressed by the criminally convicted politician, that he also held the positions of head of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Ukraine, UN rapporteur in Belarus on the topic of human rights, as well as rapporteur permanently for Russia of the EU, on which occasion he made countless visits to Moscow.
OBJECTIVE: Amplifying anti-American and, by extension, anti-Western, anti-NATO and anti-EU feelings, building a parallel geopolitical reality, in which the USA is the main culprit of the war in Ukraine, exonerating Russia and presenting it as a victim forced to defend itself.
The thief called thieves
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The loss of Bucharest's decision-making independence in favor of Washington, similar to the narrative in which political decisions regarding Romania are taken in Brussels, is nothing more than the eternal thesis of Russian and pro-Russian propaganda, a direct continuation of theses from the period of the Cold War concerning the usurping and exploiting West. In fact, Romania is the one that wanted a privileged relationship with the USA, both politically and economically, and especially military, in order to ensure its security, and the presence of the American military on the country's territory is the natural consequence of these efforts. Furthermore, Romania also asked to be accepted into NATO, and made a commitment that, as a member, it would respect and adopt the common rules for all member states.
The existence of a deep state in Romania is a theory invoked by several Romanian politicians convicted of acts of corruption; similar conspiracy theories appear in many other countries, being promoted including by populist politicians like Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Regarding the liquidation of the national elite from all fields, assuming that this happened, it is only the consequence of the academic imposture that encompassed the entire Romanian political class and the complete lack of meritocracy, as a basic criterion in the escalation of the Dambovian political hierarchy.
The false narrative of the fight between Russia and the West led by the USA is not new, it has been used since the start of the Russian invasion, in several Kremlin disinformation campaigns. Putin's regime is forcing, through self-victimization, to attract the sympathy of the international community, but until this moment, most of the world's states have condemned the invasion of Ukraine, and Western economies have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Moscow. However, the novelty in Adrian Severin's letter is the ""desire of the US to destroy the European Union"". The US-EU partnership, even after the exit of Great Britain, the traditional ally of the Americans, represents, at this moment, the most important and the closest relationship in the world, one based on common values ​​and interests, but also on strong cultural and historical ties. Both economically and militarily (through NATO), the transatlantic partnership is vital to ensure security, stability and prosperity From this point of view, a strong European community is a necessity for the US, and the idea that Washington would like the economic collapse of the EU is just another attempt by Moscow to divide the Western world.
The narrative of Romania's involvement in a NATO-Russia war in Ukraine, which appeared before the war, was circulated, in different forms, in the domestic public space. Over time, Veridica dismantled several of its versions: Ion Cristoiu claims, in mid-February, that the West and Romania will go to war on the side of Ukraine, a former American intelligence officer, suspected of close ties with the KGB, said, in December 2022, that Romania already participates with thousands of soldiers in the war in Ukraine, and an extremely controversial deputy warned, two weeks ago, that Romania is preparing for war, one in which the Romanians will be ""cannon fodder"" , participating in the battles on the front line.
The Ribbentrop - Molotov Pact was, along with the Vienna Dictatorship, the most harmful international agreement for Romania. A non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, it established the division of the areas of influence in Eastern Europe of the two totalitarian states. Among its effects, dramatic for our country, are the surrender of Bessarabia to the USSR and the alliance, forced by circumstances, with Hitler's Germany. Adrian Severin subtly tries, by referring to this treaty, to confirm one of the main ideas that Russia uses to justify the invasion, namely the fight against Nazism. At the same time, the former minister tries, just as subtly, to pass the blame for the territorial kidnappings to which Romania was subjected, to the West (now represented by Germany) and the current Ukraine, not to their main beneficiary, i.e. the former USSR, led by Russia. We cannot, however, easily notice that, today, Russia is the one that still builds its foreign policy in terms close to those of the Stalinist period. Russia - a state built by war, territorial annexations and the subjugation of about 200 distinct ethnic groups - is the one that imposes exclusion zones in the Black Sea, starts wars in the true sense of the word or hybrid wars against its neighbors, annexes territories of other states and stimulates separatism, see the cases of Transnistria, Abkhazia or South Ossetia.

In reality, Russia is the one who started the war and continues it by keeping troops in Ukraine and trying to capture even more of this country's territory.
Propaganda: Russia and China are looking for lasting peace solutions in Ukraine, and the West is against it
NEWS: ""The differences in approaches to the situation in Ukraine were discussed during the state visit to Russia by Chinese President Xi Jinping. [...] According to Vladimir Putin, the Chinese authorities are guided in their initiatives by the principles of truth and respect for international law. Xi confirmed this, arguing that the new security architecture should be built on the old international law, and not on some rules invented by the United States [...].
The West only pretends that it wants peace in Ukraine. As you know, on March 15, 2023, at a meeting of NATO defense ministers and all those who sympathize with Ukraine (Ramstein-10), it was decided to send 150 Leopard tanks to launch a liberating and victorious counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. [...]
It is a typical Western strategy and tactic, deceptive and duplicitous: they talk about peace, but, at the same time, they try to attract as many participants as possible to the process of confrontation and war, to create chaos and then present themselves as peacemakers. [...]
But Putin and Xi are experienced politicians and will try to collaborate. If Russia is defeated in Ukraine, then China will be next for a ""democratic execution"". It is a great pity that the war will continue under the guise of a struggle for peace, which the West is leading through military actions.
NARRATIVE: Russia and China want peace in Ukraine, while the West fuels the war
Reality: Russia invaded Ukraine, being supported during the war by China
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, the Russian government media wrote about the peace plan discussed by the two leaders. The Russian press accused the West of rejecting a peace plan and of wanting the continuation of hostilities at any cost.
The portal also writes that the war in Ukraine is the fault of the West, which provides Kiev with weapons and encourages it to liberate its territories. If Russia is defeated by the West in this war, the ""next victim"" will be China, which will go through a ""democratic execution"". Praising China's peace plan, rejected by Ukraine and the West, the Russian press writes that NATO states are offering tanks and missiles to Kiev, thus continuing the war. Based on these statements, a series of Telegram channels close to the Kremlin distributed false narratives about peacemakers (China, Russia) and aggressors (NATO, USA, the West) in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press calls the initiatives of Xi Jinping and Putin as ideas of lasting peace, based on respect for international law.
In reality, according to the rules of international law, especially the UN Charter, every state has an inherent right to defend itself. The Russian army invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and this act of armed aggression was condemned by most of the world's states and by the most important international organizations.
The West is not part of the conflict, but only helps Kiev to defend itself. It was not the West that caused the war by supplying Ukraine with weapons, but Moscow, which invaded a sovereign and independent state. The ""special military operation"" initially aimed to change the political leadership of Ukraine and subordinate Kiev to the political interests of Moscow. Russian propaganda makes a classic narrative loop: the cause is replaced with the consequence. The cause - the invasion of Ukraine by Russia - is presented in a deliberately false way as a consequence of the arms deliveries.
Russian aggression has been condemned by most of the world's states several times. 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. A series of international mechanisms have been launched to designate Russia as a state that finances terrorism. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of being responsible for war crimes committed in Ukraine.
President Zelensky cautiously welcomed China's peace plan to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but said it would only be acceptable if it led to the withdrawal of troops from all Ukrainian territory occupied by Vladimir Putin. Mihailo Podoliak, adviser to the Ukrainian president, rejected China's ""unrealistic"" proposal to end the conflict, writing on Twitter that Beijing should not ""bet on an aggressor who broke the law and will lose the war"". According to the international press, China has supported Russia since the first days of the war. Beijing provided technology that Moscow's military needed to continue fighting in Ukraine despite international sanctions and export controls, according to an analysis of Russian customs data. While the West supported Ukraine's defensive efforts, China helped an aggressor state.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that had the same political goal. According to Russian propaganda, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine, knowing that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. In order to convince public opinion of the necessity of mobilization in Russia, the Russian press wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and a possible NATO aggression.

In reality, the discussions did not concern Moldova's involvement in the war; on the contrary, even this is exposed to the risk of a Russian operation.
NEWS: ""The Sandu government recently received 320 million dollars from the ""big brother"". Hogan gave assurances that if the Moldovans will continue to be obedient, they will receive another 300 million. Officially, the assistance will be offered for ""energy security"".
[...]
Former president Igor Dodon has no doubt that Dereck Hogan did not come just to praise the Moldovan authorities for being obedient and to promise another 300 million. ""I think that Hoigan came to try to convince Maia Sandu to do something that she most likely does not want. It is a matter related to Transnistria. I think that the Americans want a kind of Ukrainianization of the Republic of Moldova, which is very risky for our country"".
Dodon recalled that Hogan kept his influence on the Moldovan authorities - Maia Sandu won the presidential elections in 2021 [actually they took place in 2020, ed.], only thanks to the efforts of the American ambassador.
He agrees with Dodon and Moldovan journalist Anton Svet. He warned even before the American diplomat's visit that the ""Western partners"" will soon ask Chisinau to demonstrate its loyalty.
""Washington and Bucharest - key players in our politics - will not remain indifferent for too long to the requests of Ukraine, which fights in favor of NATO, to receive more weapons. They will propose an agreement to Chisinau - more military deliveries to Kiev in exchange for a clear prospect of joining NATO and the EU. It is about weapons that are kept on the territory of Transnistria. Of course, the Moldovan army is not able to take over these deposits. Madam, in accordance with the provisions of international law, we can address such a request to Ukraine. Ukrainian politicians, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, have given assurances on several occasions that they are ready to help"".
[...]
The second international guest who visited Moldova was the head of British diplomacy, James Cleverly, who held talks with his colleague, Nicu Popescu.
Popescu, in an act of gratitude, declared Great Britain as ""Moldova's main commercial partner"", given that Chisinau's exports to Cetos Albion represent 1.7% of all Moldovan exports. Moldova's main commercial partner has always been Russia. But what you don't say to please the Western curators.""
NARRATIVES: 1. Kiev and Chisinau, with the support of the West, are preparing a military attack on Transnistria, controlled by pro-Russian forces. 2. The pro-European government in Chisinau is a vassal of the West, which helped it come to power. 3. Russia is the most important commercial partner of the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova began to appear more and more often in the center of attention of the international community with the large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The country, which is facing a secessionist conflict in the east, where a region controlled by Russia is considered the most vulnerable and the next target of Russia. Although the danger of a military invasion has decreased compared to the first months of the war, due to the resistance of the Ukrainian army, the Republic of Moldova is the target of a hybrid war from Russia.
At the beginning of February, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, declared in Brussels that the secret services of his country have information in this regard. Shortly after, the presidency in Chisinau and the Information and Security Service confirmed that they were aware of such a plan. Later, the White House described as ""deeply worrying"" the information about Russia's plan to destabilize the political situation in the Republic of Moldova. Recently, Washington accused Russia of trying to destabilize the situation in the Republic of Moldova. On March 14, the European Parliament also debated the situation in the Republic of Moldova Moldova and the challenges that the Chisinau authorities have to manage during this period.
On the other hand, Moscow launched accusations that the Ukrainian army was preparing an attack on the Transnistrian region, and Russian propaganda threw various scenarios into the public space, including that the attack could be supported by NATO military equipment stationed in Romania.
OBJECTIVE: To present Russia as the victim of a worldwide conspiracy against it. To justify the military invasion in Ukraine, presented as a militaristic state, ready to attack a peaceful region (Transnistria), just as it was preparing to do in the case of the separatist republics in Donbass. To justify possible actions of Russia against the Republic of Moldova, whose pro-European government allied itself with the ""enemies"" of Moscow. To cause panic in Transnistria. To inoculate the idea that Russia is an irreplaceable strategic, economic and commercial partner for the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The narrative about the involvement of the West in the elections in the Republic of Moldova began to be promoted as early as the 2020 presidential elections, even though at that time Vladimir Putin promised the former president from Chisinau, Igor Dodon, who was in full electoral campaign, support for The Republic of Moldova wishes him success in the elections. The accusations continued in the next campaign, for the June 2021 parliamentary elections, when accusations were launched that the West intended to falsify the election. Veridica identified and combated several false narratives, launched in particular by Russian propaganda, or its affiliates, during the 2021 parliamentary campaign. The monitoring reports of several local and international organizations did not confirm the accusations about the involvement of the West and the falsification of the election .
The former US ambassador to the Republic of Moldova, Dereck Hogan, currently the principal deputy assistant to the US secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, visited Chisinau last week, but during the meetings with the president Maia Sandu and the minister of External, Nicu Popescu, did not condition the financial support that the USA announced for the Republic of Moldova.
Russian propaganda has launched rumors about a possible Ukrainian attack on the Transnistrian region since the first months of the war. Different reasons were invoked, including the one to involve the Republic of Moldova in the war, or to capture the military ammunition from the warehouse in Cobasna. Although there is no verified information, some experts from Chisinau claim that the ammunition from Cobasna is unusable. In addition, the Chisinau authorities have excluded a military scenario each time and have reiterated that they are only examining solutions to settle the conflict peacefully.
The Republic of Moldova, a constitutionally neutral state, has one of the smallest and poorly equipped armies in the world. In 2023, expenses for the ""National Defense"" sector will reach approximately 76 million euros and, respectively, around 0.7% of GDP. It is unlikely that Ukraine or the West will place too much value on such military support In addition, the hypothetical involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the war would mean the opening of a front in western Ukraine, which would force it to divide its forces.
The Moldovan Foreign Minister, Nicu Popescu, did not say that Great Britain is the main trading partner of the Republic of Moldova, but that ""it is one of our main trading partners"". This country occupied the 13th place as the destination of Moldovan goods in 2022. It is the statement that Russia is the main trade partner of the Republic of Moldova is also false. Russia gave up this role back in 2014, when it imposed sanctions on Moldovan goods. Since then, Romania is the main trade partner of the Republic of Moldova. In 2022, trade between the two states they reached approximately 2.9 billion dollars, followed by Ukraine with almost 1.6 billion and Russia - a little more than 1.3 billion dollars. Russia, which really, in the 90s of the last century, practically held the export monopoly Moldovans, in 2022 it occupied the 6th place, with a share of less than 4.4%, according to the data of the National Bureau of Statistics in Chisinau.
NUTS OF TRUTH: The former US ambassador to the Republic of Moldova, Dereck Hogan, currently the principal deputy assistant to the US Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, and the British Foreign Minister, James Cleverly, made separate visits to Chisinau last week.

Russia's psychological operation in the Republic of Moldova

The revocation by President Vladimir Putin, a month ago, of the decree that recognized the sovereignty and integrity of the Republic of Moldova, was the signal of the outpouring of an unprecedented wave of propaganda on the state that separated Romania from the battlefields in Ukraine. On Monday, the Moldovan Minister of Defense stated that the country will face a hybrid war of Russia, intended to remove the pro-European administration from Chisinau. A review of the tactics and actions implemented in recent weeks by the Kremlin's disinformation apparatus confirms Anatolie Nosatii's assessment. On February 21, a purportedly Ukrainian Telegram channel announced that 260 soldiers in the Transnistrian sector of the Ukrainian border received the mission to attack the area of ​​the village of Cobasna, near an important ammunition depot from the time of the Soviet army. The post has gathered over 140,000 views. Another Telegram channel, with the name Typical Odessa, shares the initial post, adding that NATO military personnel would be involved in the operation. On February 23 - Defender of the Fatherland Day in Russia - the Russian Minister of Defense says that Ukraine is preparing provocations in the Transnistrian region. The official communique is picked up and spread by state media channels, such as TASS, RIA and Interfax, accompanied by alleged details, such as the simulation of an attack in Ukraine by Ukrainian soldiers in Russian uniforms. In the Republic of Moldova, the fake is propagated by the branches of Komsomolskaia Pravda and Sputnik, which are joined by local politicians such as Igor Dodon and parliamentarian Bogdan Tardea. On February 24, the Russian Foreign Ministry warns that any attack against the Russian army in Transnistria will be considered an aggression against Russia, and the leaders from Tiraspol say that they are ""ready to face any challenge"". Two days later, the Telegram channel novorossia_region, a notorious promoter of pro-Russian separatists, publishes a photo of a fake document attributed to the Kiev military that allegedly ordered Ukrainian units to be ready for the invasion of Transnistria. Within 50 minutes, the post and the photo were redistributed by two Telegram channels of News Front, a site based in occupied Crimea. An hour later, a message with the same photo marked with the logo of the Russian publication Readovka was published and then redistributed, in just ten minutes, on the Filorus channel Blocknot Moldova, quickly accumulating over 600,000 views After another ten minutes, the Telegram channel of Vladimir Rogov, a puppet of Moscow in the occupied Zaporozhye region, posts the photo, marked with the logo of his own channel. Simultaneously, the account of the main Russian newspaper Izvestia shares a link to its own article on the topic. In a few hours, the post spread in the information spaces of the Republic of Moldova and Russia, finding a place in Komsomolskaia Pravda Moldova, Rossiiskaia Gazeta - controlled by Moscow, the Russia Today platform and the RIA news agency. The most important impulse in the spread of disinformation came in the evening news of February 26 broadcast by the main channel of the state television, Pervii Kanal - Channel 1, whose messages reach about one hundred million Russian speakers. Apparently unrelated to the forged document attributed to the Ukrainians, on February 27 dozens of posts appeared on social networks accompanied by a video that claims to show the Romanian Army transferring military equipment to the border with the Republic of Moldova. The images, which actually show rehearsals for the military parade from December 1 last year in Alba Iulia, attract over 300,000 views on Telegram channels alone. The journalists of the well-known Romanian media agency Mediafax also fall into the trap of pro-Russian mystification, who announce in the headline - citing the Ukrainian press as the source - that the footage shows the movement of Himars missiles in the border area. The next day, at the same email address, the fake news was replaced - without explanation - with information about a possible Ukrainian offensive. The Kremlin's objective in promoting the two lies - Ukraine's intention to attack Transnistria and Romania's military preparations - is the same: inoculating among the citizens of the Republic of Moldova the fear of a war with Russia, a conflict in which it would be pushed by its Western partners, including Romania.
Georgia - the new front of Russia's hybrid war
eureporter.co / 12 Mar. 2023; ansa.it / 10 Mar. 2023; Radio Komsomolskaia Pravda / March 9 2023; @visegrad24 / Mar. 10 2023; bloomberg.com / Mar. 9 2023;
Russia's struggle to destabilize and keep the former Soviet republics in its sphere of influence is also evident in the eastern extremity of the Black Sea, in Georgia. The leadership in Moscow and the propagandists of the Kremlin show signs of irritation after, forced by the scale of the street protests, the government in Tbilisi withdrew the draft law on the so-called ""foreign agents"". Trying to deceive the vigilance of civil society, the authorities presented two versions of the law: one based on the model of the American regulations in the field, which strictly targets foreign entities, and a second tailored after the Russian law that sanctions the press and undesirable non-governmental organizations. Although the People's Power group, associated with the ""Georgian Dream"" - the governing party led by the oligarch with pro-Russian views Bidzina Ivanishvili - publicly supported the implementation of the American version, it promoted in Parliament repressive regulations similar to those in force in the Russian Federation. The Kremlin spokesman was quick to blame the United States for inflaming the protests in Tbilisi. The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, interpreted the pro-European and anti-Russian slogans of the demonstrators as proof of a coup attempt. He compared the Georgian protests to those of the Ukrainian Euro-Maidan in 2013 and accused the West of not showing the same understanding towards the anti-government protests in the Republic of Moldova. Unlike the head of Russian diplomacy, the press controlled by the Kremlin was much more virulent, even issuing threats. Journalist Serghei Mardan from Radio Komsomolskaia Pravda said that it would be cheaper for Russia to spend on propaganda in Georgia and Armenia than to be forced to ""denazify"" them later.
""It seems that Georgia and Armenia are no longer closed geopolitical subjects, as we thought, and must be treated accordingly. Just look at how much we have to spend on the denazification of Ukraine. Anyone who wants to join Europe must first go through the hell of war. This is what happened in the Balkans, this is what is happening in Ukraine. And yes, this will probably happen with Georgia as well.""
Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of Russia Today, believes that Georgian disobedience deserves a radical solution. Vladimir Putin's favorite propagandist pleaded for a nuclear strike on the capital Tbilisi, which she says is not worth sparing because it lacks Orthodox sanctuaries. The columnist from Bloomberg notes that, ironically, the threats of a military intervention in Georgia come 15 years after the republic from the Caucasus - aspiring member of the European Union and NATO - was invaded by Russia following the same pattern used in 2014 in the east of Ukraine. In August 2008, Moscow's soldiers intervened in Georgia under the pretext of protecting separatists from South Ossetia and Abkhazia from an alleged genocide. The war was followed by the ethnic cleansing of Georgians from 20% of the territory, still today under Russian occupation.

Politnavigator.net erroneously and selectively used survey data to present the population of the Republic of Moldova as increasingly favorable the cause of Russia in the war in Ukraine. In fact, the number of those who give justice to Russia in this war is almost twice less than those who consider that justice is on the side of Ukraine.
NEWS: ""More than half of the inhabitants of the Republic of Moldova (55.9%) are against the country's accession to NATO. For membership, only 29.6%, according to a survey conducted by the CBS-Research company, commissioned by Watchdog.MD.
In addition, 52.3% of Moldovans believe that Russians and Ukrainians are the same people, 51.6% - that Russia is actually fighting in Ukraine with NATO, 44.7% do not believe that Russia is preparing the destabilization of Moldova, 47.7% - he does not consider that Russia threatens the security of Moldova.
67.2% believe that the president of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, should go to Russia for negotiations for (a better price for) gas.
The share of Moldovans who consider that the Russian intervention was not motivated is decreasing. Already 26% are convinced that Russia is defending Donbas from Ukrainian attacks (in January they were 22.5%). The number of those who believe that Ukraine is liberated from Nazism also increased - from 12% to 13.3%. Fewer and fewer citizens blame Vladimir Putin personally - in one year this indicator dropped from 34.2% to 21%. Instead, they increasingly blame the US and NATO."" NARRATIVE: More and more Moldovan citizens agree with Russia in the war against Ukraine.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Ever since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on February 24, 2022, the Republic of Moldova was considered the most vulnerable country in the region and the next target in case the Ukrainian army surrendered. Its armed forces are practically non-existent, in addition, it is facing a secessionist conflict in the East, in the Transnistrian region, controlled by a Moscow-client regime and where a Russian military contingent and a Soviet-era military depot are stationed.
Warnings about a plan by Moscow to destabilize the internal situation in the Republic of Moldova, led by a pro-European government, intensified after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared in Brussels that his country's secret services have information in this regard.
Shortly after, the presidency in Chisinau and the Information and Security Service confirmed that they were aware of such a plan. The White House described as ""deeply worrying"" the information about Russia's plan to destabilize the political situation in the Republic of Moldova. Recently, Washington accused Russia of trying to destabilize the situation in the Republic of Moldova. On March 14, the European Parliament also debated the situation in the Republic of Moldova and the challenges that the Chisinau authorities have to manage during this period.
The authorities in Chisinau say that, at least at the current stage, the Republic of Moldova is not threatened militarily, but is the target of a hybrid war on the part of Russia. The Republic of Moldova is extremely vulnerable to Russian propaganda, according to several national and international studies and reports, and the most affected categories of citizens are the Russian-speaking minorities, which represent approximately 20% of the population, the elderly and the pious parishioners of Orthodox Church, subordinate to the Russian Patriarchate.
On March 9, the WatchDog organization presented a new opinion poll, which also includes a series of questions aimed at the impact of disinformation and propaganda on public opinion in the Republic of Moldova. The survey results were misinterpreted and presented selectively by politnavigator.
OBJECTIVE: To present the population of the Republic of Moldova as increasingly favorable to the Russian Federation and, respectively, against the European course drawn by the authorities. To convince the Russian public that the country should come out of international isolation and its cause (the war in Ukraine) is getting more and more support and understanding in other countries of the world.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian publication uses survey data in a manipulative and selective way. Some of the figures presented in the article are incorrect, others are compared with those from a previous survey, but there are hidden results that denote a different attitude of the population of the Republic of Moldova than the one the authors of the article are trying to promote.
The statement that ""only"" 29.6% of the population of the Republic of Moldova would opt for joining NATO, and approximately 56% would be against, is correct. Only that the authors, who will later compare certain results with those of a similar study carried out in in January, I'm not doing it this time either. Probably because in January, ""only"" 26.9% would have voted for joining NATO.
The survey also shows that 63.3% of the respondents believe that Maia Sandu should go to Moscow to negotiate the gas price. Not 67.2%, as stated by Politnavigator.
At the same time, according to a similar survey organized by Watchdog in May 2022, 25% of respondents considered Putin personally guilty for provoking the war in Ukraine, compared to 21% currently. Instead, the number of those who blame Russia increased from 14.7% to 19.5%. The number of those who blame the USA and NATO remained at the same level, refuting the data presented by politnavigator.
The authors of the article do not refer to the fact that Vladimir Putin's rating in the list of trust of Moldovan citizens dropped from 38% in January to 33.8% in March, and he fell from first place to fifth in the list of trust in international personalities. It also ignores the fact that 78.4% of the respondents would not agree that their country should support Russia in exchange for a lower gas price, even if the majority of citizens were affected by the increase in tariffs. 37.7% of respondents agree with Ukraine in this war and almost twice as many - 18.3% - with Russia. The survey also shows that more than half of Moldovans would vote for joining the EU, while for the Eurasian Union - slightly more than 20 percent. Russia came almost to the bottom of the list of trust from a list of international organizations and states - with 47%, compared to 76% Germany, 74% Romania, 71.5%. France.
""The survey includes multiple questions aimed at the impact of disinformation and propaganda on public opinion in the Republic of Moldova. In particular, there is still a very high impact of the Kremlin's propaganda on topics related to security, Russian aggression in Ukraine, international relations and energy topics. Compared to the previous similar survey, small improvements can be noted on several topics targeted by disinformation campaigns. Thus we can note that, for example, the number of those who said that the Republic of Moldova should support Russian aggression against Ukraine in exchange for cheaper gas decreased from 14% to 11%. At the same time, despite the intense discussions of the last month, the number of those who consider that the Russian Federation represents a threat to our country increased by only 1% (from 41% to 42%)"", note the authors of the study.
NUTS OF TRUTH: A fairly large number of Moldovan citizens agree with Russia in the war in Ukraine, but an exact number of them would be difficult to estimate, including because the results of the elections in the Republic of Moldova showed that the pre-election polls have a large margin of error, which reduces their credibility.

In reality, the creation of this protection zone can only take place through demilitarization, that is, through the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the plant, the option excluded by Moscow.
Propaganda: Ukraine does not want to collaborate with the IAEA for the creation of a protection zone in Zaporozhye
NEWS: ""Kiev is, for now, not ready to implement the IAEA initiative regarding the creation of a protection zone around the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, which will exclude the opening of fire from the territory of the plant and against it, declared the permanent representative of Russia next to the international bodies from Vienna, Mihail Ulianov [...].
""Ukraine, unfortunately, is not ready to take this step,"" he wrote on Telegram on Saturday. The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is located on the left bank of the Dnieper, near the city of Energodar. It is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe by the number of reactors and capacity. There are six reactors with a capacity of 1 gigawatt each. From March 2022, the plant is under the protection of the Russian military. The Russian Foreign Ministry emphasized that this step is necessary to avoid the leakage of nuclear and radioactive materials.
The Ukrainian army continues to regularly bomb Energodar and the territory of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. The Russian Minister of Defense, Sergey Soigu, said that the regime in Kiev is trying to make possible the occurrence of a nuclear catastrophe, continuing to intentionally bomb the plant"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine blocks the initiative to create a protection zone at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant.
Reality: Russia opposes the IAEA's proposal to demilitarize the plant, increasing the risk of a nuclear catastrophe
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the creation of a protection zone at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant depends not only on Ukraine, but especially on Russia. The Russian press quotes the permanent representative of Moscow to the international bodies in Vienna, Mihail Ulianov, who manipulates public opinion by telling only half the truth regarding the creation of a safety zone at Energodar. According to the IAEA experts, both sides must cease fire in the plant area, this being the step before demilitarization.
Moscow says it has every right to ""protect"" the center militarily - located on the territory of Ukraine and occupied by force, including the use of tanks, at the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Ukraine - and vehemently opposes the idea of ​​withdrawing the military, ammunition, weapons and equipment that it has placed on the territory of the nuclear object. In August 2022, the Kremlin opposed the demilitarization of the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant and asked the West to put pressure on Ukraine to reduce tensions in its area. The IAEA proposal, which provides for the demilitarization of the plant is rejected by Russia especially after Russia illegally annexed the Zaporizhia region of Ukraine, which it partially occupied, in September 2022. Despite the warnings of the international community, President Vladimir Putin ordered the inclusion of the plant in the Russian electricity grid and in the register of federal nuclear facilities.
According to Russia's false narratives, which contradict the norms of international law, the plant is the property of the Russian state, and the military, tanks and missiles are kept there to defend the area from the bombings and provocations organized by the Ukrainian army. Based on this truncated logic, the creation of a protection zone depends only on Ukraine, because Russia manages its nuclear objectives as it sees fit.
Russia ignores the request of 42 states of the world to withdraw the army from the territory of the power station in order to create a protection zone. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly requested that the Russian forces leave the perimeter of the nuclear power plant in Zaporozhye. The UN also launched a call for the demilitarization of the central area. All this information proves that it is not Ukraine that is blocking the initiative to create a protection zone at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, but Russia, which has invaded a sovereign state and is endangering global nuclear security. Russia's actions are called by experts nuclear terrorism, applied in the context of a war of invasion.
The plant was exposed to the risk of a nuclear accident even by the Russian army repeatedly - it opened fire directly against it, launched shots from its territory and by bombing the Ukrainian energy network it was disconnected from it. The most recent such attack, which led to the disconnection, took place on March 9, when the plant was disconnected for the sixth time since the beginning of the war from the Ukrainian electricity grid after a Russian missile attack. The Ukrainian nuclear operator Energoatom warned again about the risk of a serious accident following the Russian bombings, given that electricity is needed to keep the reactor cooling mechanisms running, and existing generators are useful as back-up solutions. breakdown for exceptional situations.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the situation in the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant area. The Russian press wrote that the IAEA mission praised the Russian army for defending the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant from Ukrainian bombings. According to Russian propaganda, at the behest of the US, Kiev will cause a nuclear disaster in Zaporozhye, or an explosion will be ""organized"" to hide the traces of American biological weapons laboratories.

The differences between sex and gender, from the ""parental"" perspective
NEWS: ""So, as a result of this expensive effort, our children would learn that gender and sex are two different things, that gender is socially and culturally assigned, that it is eligible and fluid, as well as other Marxist-progressive aberrations , in total disdain for the opinion of the parents, publicly expressed, regarding the penetration of gender ideology in the school. The experience of countries that have already produced a generation of young people who no longer know exactly what sex they are and what species they belong to, or the tragedies of teenagers who rush to increase the turnover of clinics where they undergo mutilating operations, with irreversible effects, only to find out later that they made a huge mistake, they didn't stand in the way of those who worked on the T-SHIRT project.""
NARRATIVES: 1. Traditional teachings will be replaced in the school curriculum with LGBT propaganda, leading to serious behavioral disorders among children. 2. LGBT propaganda in Romanian schools has the intention of changing the natural sexual orientation of children.
CONTEXT: The multiple inequalities between women and men on the labor market, in public or private life, have been a concern of society for years. Even if the status of women has changed considerably compared to previous decades, women and men still do not have the same chances in terms of educational and professional paths or family life. That is why the topic has been debated in recent years, and the authorities, in partnership with educational institutions and various private entities, are trying to create a legislative framework to reduce these gaps, at the same time running several campaigns to raise awareness of the problem and finding solutions to solve it.
In this sense, the University of Bucharest was a partner in an international project, which provides teachers with an online platform containing various materials about gender equality in the classroom. The announcement of the completion of the project, two years after its start, reactivated the Alliance of Parents, the NGO noted in recent years especially for protests during the pandemic and taking anti-vaccine and anti-abortion positions. The current disinformation, coming less than two weeks after the one through which the representatives of the Alliance stated that students in Romania are obliged to watch films that make propaganda for suicide and homosexuality, is launched on the market in the specific context of the presentation of the new education laws in the Government of Romania , which are to be debated and adopted by the Parliament.
In a general framework, the narrative follows the line of Russian propaganda, which reached its peak with the invasion of Ukraine, which presents the public opinion with a morally decadent West, which has deviated from Christian values. Topics related to the LGBT community have been used for years by Moscow in attempts to discredit the European cultural space. Thus, the EU is presented as ""Gayropa"", a space in antithesis to that of traditional, Christian, Orthodox values, which Russia would represent. Thus, the idea of ​​an ""LGBT agenda"" is induced that the EU would try to forcefully impose it. However, similar narratives are also promoted in the area of ​​the Western radical right; part of it, but not all, was also cultivated by Russia.
OBJECTIVE: Increasing anti-LGBT feelings, generating anti-system social movements, promoting the introduction of ultra-religious and ultra-conservative propaganda into the educational system, increasing one's own notoriety.
Anti-discrimination education begins with educators
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: T-Shirt is a project addressed to teachers, it is not part of the school curriculum and is not debated in class. The project was completed on November 15, 2022, but the Parents' Alliance chose only now, in the context of the parliamentary debates on education laws, to protest against it. A simple reading of the project's objectives is enough to see that it does not talk at all about gender identity and does not even debate the subject of the difference between sex and gender. He only addresses the topic of gender-based inequalities and ways to cultivate learning activities that do not favor discriminatory behaviors. The main goal of the program is education favorable to inclusion and equality. Recommended mainly for primary school teachers, the online platform, resulting from the project, offers information on several topics: policies for gender equality, research on education and gender, the role of gender stereotypes in society and the importance of the didactic act in dismantling them, And so on
If they had had the slightest curiosity to read the information in the link with which they argue their position, the members of the Parents' Alliance could have easily found that schools are recommended, among other things, to provide separate toilets for girls and boys, spaces with special destination for menstruating girls, the provision of clean drinking water for girls and boys, or the implementation of anti-bullying policies, with zero tolerance for harassment. None of the points displayed in this list refers to the ""ideology"" of LGBT or gender identity. The elimination of gender inequalities has absolutely nothing in common with the insinuations of the Alliance of Parents, and this is one of the main concerns of society, including at the level of the Union European.
If we talk about the differences between sex and gender, which Alianta claims will disrupt children's development, we must note that they exist and, in principle, can be summarized as follows: sex has two large categories, men and women, and gender can be masculine and feminine. According to the World Health Organization, the term ""sex"" refers to the biological, anatomical and physiological characteristics that define men and women, and the term ""gender"" refers to social, psychological and behavioral aspects, especially the norms imposed by society, aspects which society considers suitable for women and men. And, despite the claims of the fighters for the Christian future of children, sexual orientation cannot be ""educated"" or imposed, it not being a choice, as several studies in the field have revealed over the years. Social influence in changing sexual orientation of a person, invoked by psychologists and sociologists, must be interpreted in the sense that those who hide their sexual preferences can give up the secret, in a normal society, without fear of being discriminated or marginalized for it.

At the same time, he tries to validate the idea that the Patriarchate is equidistant and opposes the ""fratricidal"" war. In reality, the Moscow Patriarchate functions as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin and the Ukrainian authorities have only investigated links between it and the Russian services, on the one hand, and some prelates from Ukraine.
Propaganda: A religious persecution is taking place in Ukraine
NEWS: ""The Orthodox Church of Ukraine hates everything related to Russia. It is in her interest to have this armed conflict that removes the prospect of peace, says the deputy head of the Synodal Directorate of the Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church with the press, Vahtang Kipsidze. [...]
At the same time, the attitude of the Russian Orthodox Church towards the special military operation is based on the conviction that we are witnessing a fratricidal war caused by foreign forces. Some Russian chaplains died on the battlefield, being killed by foreign weapons. [...]
The political regime in Kiev destroyed the Ukrainian Orthodox Church without thinking for the simple reason that it exists. There was such a great religious persecution during the period of war communism and the religious persecutions of the 30s. [...]
We just have to pray. Our unity through prayer will greatly help the people who have been persecuted for many years"".
NARRATIVES: 1. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church is persecuted by Kiev as in the communist period. 2. The war in Ukraine is a fratricidal one. 3. The Russian Orthodox Church prays for the persecuted Ukrainians.
Reality: Kiev aims to limit the activities of religious organizations affiliated with Russia during the war
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: After the searches of the Orthodox dioceses and monasteries subordinated to the Moscow Patriarchate until the war, the Russian government press launched a series of stories about the persecution of Orthodoxy in Ukraine, arguing that the ""special military operation"" is aimed to save not only the Russophones, but also the Orthodox from the ""Nazi regime"" in Kiev.
According to the Ukrainian authorities, it is not about any persecution of Orthodoxy in Ukraine, but about the verification of church institutions subordinated to Moscow. The representatives of the Security Service (SBU) claim that they have discovered ""Russian passports, propaganda literature and permits"" issued by the occupation authorities. Documents have been identified that confirm that some members of the Orthodox church structure have Russian citizenship. The SBU also shows that he found correspondence between the hierarchs in Ukraine and the coordinators in Moscow, including recommendations regarding the messages and sermons from the church liturgy in the context of the war in Ukraine.
A commission of experts, empowered by the Government of Ukraine, showed in January that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church remains a substructure of the Russian Orthodox Church. ""Benefiting from some rights and freedoms, this structure is not, however, an autocephalous Church"", according to the experts' conclusions. They claim that the relations between the church in Kiev and the one in Moscow are of subordination, not of cooperation.
Kiev's fears regarding the existence of a network of foreign agents in churches are generally legitimate, taking into account the Russian-Ukrainian war. According to the officials, materials promoting and popularizing separatist ideas were found in the dioceses of Kirovograd and Oleksandria. The former secretary of the diocese of Odessa Andrei Novikov fled to Russia. He has a Telegram channel, with the help of which he distributes Russian propaganda narratives and discredits the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Therefore, it is not about any persecution of the Orthodox in Ukraine, but about a much more rigorous investigation of the links that some church structures have with Moscow. At the same time, no Orthodox church in Ukraine was closed, and the rights of parishioners were not restricted in any way.
The Russian Orthodox Church has blessed the war in Ukraine since the first days of the large-scale invasion, causing great indignation in Ukrainian society. In September 2022, the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill declared that death in the war in Ukraine ""washes away all sins"", comparing the sacrifice of the Russian military to that of the Savior Jesus Christ. After the invasion of Ukraine, Patriarch Kirill handed the coordinator of the Russian Guard participating in the military operations in Donbass an icon to protect the defenders of the ""Russian world"".
The false narrative launched by the representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church makes an artificial distinction between war and ""special military operation"" in order to manipulate public opinion. According to the Synodal Directorate of Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, the ""special operation"" was launched by Moscow to stop the war caused by the West in Ukraine. This is actually the terminology of the Kremlin's propaganda, just as the Kremlin's propaganda also refers to the notion of ""fratricidal war"" which suggests that the Ukrainians are not a distinct people from the Russians. This takeover of the Kremlin's propaganda is, moreover, another proof that The Russian Orthodox Church is, to a large extent, a propaganda arm of the Kremlin.It should also be noted that over time it has been written about Patriarch Kirill's connections with the KGB and the FSB, services associated with President Vladimir Putin.
The West has pledged to support Ukraine in this war to stop the armed aggression of the Russian Federation. So, the actions of the US, NATO and the EU are a reaction to the ""special military operation"" against a free state.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the war in Ukraine. The Russian press also wrote that Moscow must mobilize to defeat NATO in the new ""war for the defense of the homeland"", and because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are freed from Russia. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion starting with November 2021, that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, being forced to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

Separatist leader: Ukraine's nuclear power plant specialists will become cannon fodder
NEWS: ""The president of the civic movement ""We are together with Russia"", a member of the Zaporozhye Region Administration Council, said that the Zelensky regime is ready to turn the collaborators of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine into cannon fodder. In the territories controlled by the group of drug addicts and Nazis from the post-Ukrainian space, the collaborators of the nuclear power plants will be mobilized.
The deputies of the Supreme Rada addressed the National Agency ""Energoatom"" to obtain the list of specialists who can be enlisted in the army. The Zelensky regime is governed by a simple formula - war to the last Ukrainian.""
NARRATIVE: Nuclear power plant specialists from Ukraine will be sent to the front.
Reality: Ukrainian legislation prohibits the mobilization of specialists from companies of critical importance
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the enlistment in the army of specialists who are employed at enterprises of critical and strategic importance for the Ukrainian state is prohibited by law. The employees of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine cannot be enlisted in the army, according to the mobilization law, because the National Agency ""Energoatom"", which coordinates these state enterprises, is of critical importance. During the martial law period, the state considers the specialists in this field the same as important as the fighters in the front area.
The news published on a series of news websites and promoted on social interaction networks is based on a document signed by two Ukrainian parliamentarians, which asks the nuclear power plants to provide them with lists of people who will be enlisted in the army. This document is fake, taking into account the grammatical and stylistic mistakes in the text, as well as a series of names of companies and officials written similar to the traditional formulas in the Russian language, but foreign to the Ukrainian language. The document is addressed to the ""Energoatom"" company, being the letter ""E"" from the Russian language, and not the one from the Ukrainian language. Also, the names of the parliamentarians who would have sent the respective request to the nuclear power plants are written in Russian style.
There are also a number of elements of the procedure that demonstrate that ""the request of the Ukrainian parliamentarians is a false one. According to the law of preparation for mobilization and mobilization, the process of organizing enlistment in the army is the responsibility of the Government through the Ministry of Defense, and not that of the Parliament. The request deputies would not have passed the legal department's opinion, provided by the Supreme Rada Regulation, if it was formulated in this way. Parliamentarians can only control and monitor the mobilization process, but they do not have the right to be involved in the launch of mechanisms that belong to the competences of other structures Of the state.
The purpose of this false narrative is to demonstrate to the public opinion in Russia and the former Soviet states that the crisis of human resources in the Ukrainian army is becoming more and more acute, Kiev being forced to mobilize nuclear energy specialists.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the mobilization carried out in Ukraine in the context of the war with Russia. The Russian press wrote that ordinary Ukrainians have no reason to fight against Russia, while the mothers and wives of Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle protest the war. According to Russian propaganda, Volodymyr Zelensky killed more than 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army, and the losses of the Ukrainian army are so high that students are forced to donate blood for the military.

In reality, the presentation of information related to the armed forces by the state president, in the joint session of the two chambers of the Romanian Legislature, is only a more formal procedure, which takes place every year.
Romanian soldiers and policemen, on the front in Ukraine
NEWS: ""Information from the President of Romania, Mr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, regarding the approval of the forces and means of the Romanian Army and the Ministry of Internal Affairs that are sent to missions and operations outside the national territory in 2023. In other words, the president has the duty, it seems, is only to inform us that troops belonging to the Ministry of Internal Affairs will be sent, namely policemen, gendarmes, all the structures belonging to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Romanian army, the Romanian soldiers. They inform us that they will be able to be sent to war outside our country.

Information from the President of Romania, Mr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, regarding the approval of the deployment of the NATO response force with a very high reaction capacity, in order to prepare and carry out military operations on the territory of Romania. In 2023, according to the planning data sent by the NATO authorities. That is, NATO troops to prepare for war on Romanian territory.
Careful! The draft decision for the amendment of the annex to the decision of the Parliament of Romania no. 23/2011 regarding the establishment of the joint commission for European integration between the Parliament of Romania and the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. So they want to make a mixture between the Parliament of Romania and the Parliament of Moldova.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The Romanian Parliament voted for the country's entry into the war. 2. Troops of the Romanian armed forces and the Ministry of the Interior will be sent to war outside the country's borders. 3. NATO and the EU are preparing the union of Romania with Moldova.
The case of Diana Sosoaca is not unique in Parliament
CONTEXT: The narrative according to which Romania will be drawn into a NATO-Russia war in Ukraine, and the Romanians will participate in the fighting on the front line, dates back to before the start of the Russian invasion in Ukraine. It is part of an entire arsenal of fake news and disinformation of Moscow aimed at justifying the statements that blame the West for the conflict in Ukraine. Since the outbreak of the war, the Kremlin has portrayed itself as a victim of NATO and the European community, which is forced to fight in a new ""war for the defense of the homeland"". At regular intervals, Russian propaganda launches into the public space various false narratives, which fuel the main theses that accompany its aggressive policy in Eastern Europe. Romania's military involvement in the war in Ukraine was also suggested in December 2022, by the voice of a former American officer, suspected of ties to the KGB, who asserts that Romania participates with thousands of soldiers in the war in Ukraine.
This time, the narrative is resumed by a Romanian parliamentarian, Mihai Ioan Lasca. Member of Parliament since 2020, he was noticed in the public space especially by the conviction for beatings and other violent acts, after he beat the partner of his ex-girlfriend. He is also accused by DIICOT of smuggling migrants at the border with Hungary, reasons for which he was excluded from the party on whose lists he was elected. Although on his own website he declares that he graduated from a private law school in 2006 (at the age of 26), he did not work until 2017 when, according to his own statements, he founded ""a company with the profile of ""guarding and protection"" and security system installation services that I managed to develop very quickly"". Mihai Ioan Lasca's parliamentary career was marked by several questions, in which he asked, among other things, to prove the existence of the SARS CoV 2 virus or to explain to him what the ""white lines in the sky"" are leaves their planes behind them. With the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, deputy Lasca became one of the promoters of several fake news of Muscovite origin, claiming that Romania's involvement in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is ""wanted"" or that the Ukrainian forces have shot down a Romanian plane and a helicopter in Dobrogea. Also, in November 2022, he asked the Supreme National Defense Council to publicly declare that Romania does not want war. Everything culminated with his statements in which he affirms that Russia has not done any harm to Romania in recent years, unlike the West, which ""imposes on us all kinds of very, very bad measures"". Including in the monologue held in full session of To the Parliament, Lasca uses to describe the aggression against Ukraine, a preferred term in Russia, ""military intervention in Ukraine"".
OBJECTIVE: Increasing anti-Western sentiments by exploiting the fear of a part of the population that Romania could be drawn into a war, amplifying anti-Ukrainian sentiments, exploiting a possible social uprising for electoral purposes.
The information, whether it is mandatory, is not approved
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: NATO has stated countless times that it does not want to get involved in the war in Ukraine. That's why, before the start of the invasion, the NATO soldiers known as instructors in Ukraine were urgently withdrawn. Also, the North Atlantic Alliance was careful to avoid any possible incident with the Russian forces. Thus, Kiev's repeated calls to obtain an air exclusion zone that would eliminate the threat to Russian aviation were refused, because NATO does not want a conflict with Russia, which could have dramatic consequences. Instead, it offered support by pressuring Moscow with sanctions and supplying Ukraine with weapons, ammunition, humanitarian aid and funds. Romania is a full member of NATO, and its reactions are only in accordance with the policy of the Alliance and consist in strengthening the deterrence and defense position on its eastern flank.
According to the Constitution, the president of Romania is the commander of the armed forces and fulfills the function of president of the Supreme Council of Defense of the Country, a body which, according to the same Constitution, organizes and unitarily coordinates the activities related to the defense of the country and national security, participation in maintaining international security and defense collective in military alliance systems, as well as actions to maintain or restore peace. As a result, the president has the obligation to inform the Parliament, annually, on all these aspects. The purely formal character of the procedure is, in this particular case, highlighted by the fact that the president will not be present in Parliament, as he is on an official visit abroad. In addition, since a month ago, the permanent offices of the two legislative chambers took note of the three briefings of President Iohannis, in an online meeting. Their reading in the plenary session of the Parliament is just a simple formality.
What deputy Lasca does not know or does not want to say is that, not earlier than last year, through the same procedure, Klaus Iohannis informed the Parliament that the forces of the Romanian army will be sent, in 2022, a total of 3,273 soldiers, and those of the MAI 2,536 employees, in missions and operations outside the national territory, under the leadership of NATO, EU, UN and OSCE. Also, the presence of foreign soldiers on Romanian territory is not a novelty: at the moment, more than 5,500 soldiers belonging to the armies of other countries are in the military bases at Mihail Kogalniceanu, Deveselu, Turda or Cincu. The case of Romania is not even unique. Immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO decided to double the number of battalions on the eastern flank and sent battle groups to Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria.
It is obvious that every armed force in the world trains for war, not for beauty pageants, regardless of where the training takes place, so to claim this fact is at least ridiculous. And indeed, contrary to the opinion of deputy Lasca, the trainings have a purely defensive purpose. The approval, if necessary, of the intervention of the NATO Response Force with a very high reaction capacity in order to prepare and carry out military operations on the territory of Romania is also a defensive operation. The ultimate argument lies in the name itself: response force - reaction capacity.
The absurd narrative of the forced union between Romania and Moldova has already been dismantled in the pages of Veridica, and the fact that the parliaments of the two states will form a joint commission does not even remotely mean that the two legislatures will merge. Although he boasts that he is a graduate of legal sciences, Mihai Ioan Lasca does not even seem to know that, in general, the parliaments of two or more countries can create mixed commissions, for cooperation in common goals of all member countries.
In the last instance, it must be specified that the joint meeting of the two chambers of the Romanian Parliament had as its main purpose, in fact, the appointment of the head of the Permanent Electoral Authority, the president of the National Audiovisual Council and an accountants' adviser, vice-president of the Audit Authority. At the same time, another item on the agenda of the joint meeting was the appointment of the president of the Permanent Delegation of the Romanian Parliament to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, not, as Lasca understood, ""to designate each Parliament, each party in the Romanian Parliament, to designate representatives to be in collaboration with NATO on the territory of Romania."" The secret vote, about which the deputy warned with such emotion in his voice, was intended for the above appointments. The information, regardless of the sender and recipient, is taken for granted, not voted . Publication / Media:

In reality, the Ukrainian leader's words were taken out of context, he was actually addressing the subject of activating Article 5 of the NATO Treaty if the Alliance is attacked by Russia.
Propaganda: Zelensky asks NATO to become part of the armed conflict in Ukraine
NEWS: ""The leader of the Kiev regime, Volodymyr Zelensky, commented during a discussion with journalists on the participation of the US and NATO in the Ukrainian conflict and proposed to the West to send their children to the area of ​​military actions.
""The USA must send its sons and daughters just like we do. They will have to fight. And they will pay with their lives,"" declared the leader of Ukraine in a very harsh style.
TV presenter Olga Skabeeva is convinced that in this way Zelenski provokes a large-scale war between the West and Russia. ""Zelenski asked NATO to enter the conflict,"" she wrote on her Telegram channel.
NARRATIVE: Zelenski asked NATO member states to send troops to Ukraine
Reality: Zelenski expressed his concern that after Ukraine, Russia will attack a NATO member state
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Volodymyr Zelensky's words were taken out of context and presented in a convenient way to the Russian government media to justify the need for the ""special military operation"", as the full-scale invasion is called in Moscow of Ukraine by Russia.
The President of Ukraine did not ask the NATO member states or the USA to ""send their sons and daughters"" to the war. The Russian press and some pages of social interaction networks distribute only the final part of a statement by Zelensky, eliminating the presentation of the context of to the leader from Kiev.
In a press conference organized one year after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Zelensky declared that a capitulation of Ukraine would move the war to the territory of NATO states. ""Russia will attack the NATO states, it will attack the Baltic states. So it will be. Then the US will send its sons and daughters, just like we are doing now. They will fight there because it is NATO"". Zelenski did not talk about sending troops to the territory of Ukraine or about the duty of the US to support Kiev with human resources, but emphasized the role of the NATO collective security system to which Ukraine aspired.
At the same press conference, Zelenski mentioned that the West's support of Ukraine during the war through arms deliveries represents a guarantee for the EU and NATO that there will be no expansion of the armed conflict on their territory. The leader from Kiev argued that a state's refusal to help Ukraine will cause the war to expand and other states to send their sons to the front to defend themselves against invasion.
To give more veracity to this fake news, the journalist Olga Skabeeva, called Putin's ""iron puppet"", is quoted, who commented on Telegram that ""Zelenski asked NATO to enter the conflict"".
Veridica dismantled a series of propaganda messages promoted by the Russian government media regarding the involvement of the West in the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, the Kremlin must mobilize to defeat NATO in the new ""war for the defense of the homeland"". At the same time, the West would force Russia to expand its military operations, after the EU sent soldiers to Ukraine before 2022. Press pro-Kremlin also wrote that Volodymyr Zelensky is asking the West for more weapons to cause a world nuclear war. Publication / Media:

Russian propaganda claims that the measure - taken as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court - is intended to prepare the union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania.
NEWS: ,, PAS continuously brings the Republic of Moldova closer to the union with Romania. After changing the name of the language, it is not excluded that the ruling party also changes the name of the country. It would be very convenient for Bucharest, because the disappearance of Moldova from the world map will also solve the internal problems of Romania, where approximately 7 million Moldovans live. The Romanization process has been taking place for a hundred years, they were inoculated that there is Bessarabia, not Moldova and it should not be a separate state, declared Nicolae Pascaru.
At the same time, he mentioned that the history of the Moldovan statehood is richer than that of the Romanians. The Moldavian Voivodeship has been known since the century. XIV, but Romania was created in 1859. There were other attempts at union, but they failed.
Romanians call Moldovans Russian, because they know what role the Russian Empire played for Moldova, claims Pascaru. Chisinau was built by the Russian Empire. We have the right to our own identity, but that disturbs Bucharest"" NARRATIVES: 1. The PAS government wants to eliminate the Moldovan language because it is preparing the union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania. 2. Moldovans and Romanians are different peoples. 3. Romania and its agents are trying to eliminate the idea of ​​the Moldovan people because the Romanians do not want to lose the part of Moldova they occupied. 4. The Russian Empire/Russia played a civilizing role for the territory of the Republic of Moldova and built and developed Chisinau, unlike Romania, which did not make efforts to develop Bessarabia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The existence of two distinct peoples - the Moldavians and the Romanians, who speak two different languages, is a thesis strongly promoted by Soviet historiography. The USSR also created a so-called autonomous republic on the left bank of the Dniester, where Moldovanism was promoted and prepared the re-annexation of today's territory of the Republic of Moldova. The former president from Chisinau, the communist Vladimir Voronin, declares that ""the Moldovan language is the mother of the Romanian language"". He also demanded rights for the ""Moldovan minority"" in Romania and promoted an organization of Moldovans in Romania
The union of the two Romanian principalities in 1859 is presented as an annexation of the Country of Moldova and it is suggested that the Republic of Moldova would have the right to claim the return of Moldova from the right of the Prut.
Romania is presented in the Russian press, but also by some of the politicians and mass media institutions from the Republic of Moldova as a revanchist, with territorial claims over the Republic of Moldova and some regions in the southeast of Ukraine.
They were brought back to the fore after the Chisinau Parliament voted a law that excludes the phrase ""Moldovan language"" from the legislation.
OBJECTIVE: To bring back into discussion the thesis about the existence of two distinct peoples - Moldavian and Romanian and even emphasize that the Moldavian one is superior. To feed the phobias of a part of the population towards an alleged union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania, promoted by the pro-European government in Chisinau.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: By adopting the law that eliminates the phrase ""Moldovan language"", the Parliament applied a decision of the Constitutional Court from December 2013, which established that the text of the Declaration of Independence, which establishes the Romanian language as the state language, prevails over the text of the Constitution ( voted in 1994 by a center-left parliament) in which the state language is called ""Moldovan"".
Romania was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Moldova and even if over the years there have always been discussions about a possible union, this topic is not discussed at the official level either in Bucharest or in Chisinau.
The thesis of Moldovanism, which appeared during the Tsarist Empire and was intensively promoted during the Soviet period, represented one of the elements of propaganda intended to justify the annexation of a part of the territory inhabited by ethnic Romanians. However, this thesis is rejected by historians and linguists on both banks of the Prut.
The promotion of the narrative about two different peoples and languages ​​was initially done to motivate Moscow's steps for the retrocession of Bessarabia after the union with Romania in 1918, and then to explain the existence of the two countries that share the same culture and language - Romania and the Republic of Moldova.
In Romania, there is a ""Moldovanist"" current that would certify the thesis that a distinct people lived on the territory of historical Moldova; the Moldavians in Romania identify themselves as Romanians.
The statement that the city of Chisinau was developed/built by the Russians is also false (and not new). Chisinau was named the administrative capital after the territorial seizure of 1812 and the annexation to the Russian Empire, but it was not until 1873, when Bessarabia became a governorate, that the city began to develop. Chisinau modernized especially thanks to the mayor Carol Schmidt, who led the city for 25 years, between 1877 and 1903, and radically changed its appearance following the collaboration with the architect Alexandru Bernardazzi.
Chisinau continued to develop very intensively during the interwar period, under the Romanian administration. Many comfortable houses, urban villas, buildings with apartments, very well designed schools were built in the city, libraries, printing houses, theaters were opened. It was also then that a series of businesses began to operate, the first mechanized mill, the bread and sausage factory, the candy factory, shoe, knitwear, fur factories, exhibitions of industrial goods and agricultural machinery were organized. In 1919, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry was founded in Chisinau, the banking sector began to develop, with the establishment of Banca Bessarabia, and in 1921 the first airport was opened.

82,584,Students in Romania are forced to watch films that promote suicide and homosexuality,the school tries to transform children into members of the lgbt community,False,[],['Romania'],,,,,,,,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-elevii-din-romania-sunt-obligati-sa-urmareasca-filme-care-fac-propaganda-pentru-sinucidere-si-homosexualitate,,03.03.2023,,Romania,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-elevii-din-romania-sunt-obligati-sa-urmareasca-filme-care-fac-propaganda-pentru-sinucidere-si-homosexualitate,,"Romanian students are educated that accepting sexual advances is a moral obligation, and suicide is a way to solve problems, claims an association that campaigns for ""defending, promoting and strengthening the rights of parents in Romania"". It all started from the students' viewing National College ""Scoala Centrala"" from Bucharest, as part of an extracurricular activity developed in partnership with the French Institute, of a film that debates the friendship between two teenagers faced with age-specific challenges.
On the route Europe - Gayropa, via Moscow
NEWS: ""The Alliance of Parents from Romania became aware of the fact that, on the 13th and 15th of February 2023, the students of the 7th and 8th grades were taken to watch the movie Close, as an educational activity, carried out in partnership with the French Institute. The film explicitly promotes the LGBT way of life, and the explanations given by the educational unit in response to the parents' reaction represent an embarrassing attempt to justify the training of children in an activity whose educational messages can be summarized as follows:
1-,,if a person of the same sex makes advances to you, i.e. shows ""romantic interest"" towards you, you must respond to those advances, because otherwise that person will commit suicide, and you will feel guilty""
2-,,suicide is a means of solving problems.""
NARRATIVE: LGBT propaganda in Romanian schools has the intention of changing the natural sexual orientation of children.
CONTEXT: The morally decadent West, which deviated from Christian values, is one of the main narratives of the propaganda war waged by Moscow against the EU and NATO, intensified to the maximum with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Topics related to the LGBT community have been used for years in attempts to discredit the European cultural space. Thus, the EU is presented as ""Gayropa"", a space in antithesis to that of traditional, Christian, Orthodox values, which Russia would represent. Not infrequently, homosexuality and pedophilia are presented to be practically the same thing, for to convince the public that, by promoting equality in relation to sexual orientation, the aim is actually to legalize pedophilia. Thus, the idea of ​​an ""LGBT agenda"" that the EU would try to impose by force is induced. The messages are then taken over by local ""spokesmen"" and adapted to the specifics of each targeted country.
However, similar narratives are also promoted in the area of ​​the Western radical right; part of it, but not all, was also cultivated by Russia.
In Romania, the strongest voice of the narrative was the Family Coalition, an association of several NGOs, foundations and associations, many of which have as their object of activity the promotion of traditional Christian values ​​(Parents for Religion Hour Association) , Association of Catholic Families ,,Vladimir Ghika"", Association of Romanian Orthodox Christian Students, Medical-Christian Philanthropic Association ,,Christiana"", Christian Foundation Father Arsenie Boca, Foundation of Holy Martyrs Brancovini, Association ,,Romanian Orthodox Youth"", Association ,,Orthodox Places "" etc.). The resounding failure of the main initiative of this coalition, namely the amendment of article 48 of the Romanian Constitution, led most of these organizations to regroup under another name, Platforma Impreuna, and one of the message bearers of the new coalitions became Alianta Parintilor, an NGO founded in 2016, noted in recent years especially for protests during the pandemic and taking anti-vaccine and anti-abortion positions.
In the middle of last month, several students of the ""Scoala Centrala"" National College from Bucharest participated in the viewing of the film Close, winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2022, an event that gave rise to a riot in the part of the parents of some of the students. The reason is represented by the fact that the theme and message of the film by the Belgian director Lukas Dhont are considered by them to be, in fact, a more or less disguised propaganda for the ""LGBT way of life"". Following this gesture, the Parents' Alliance addressed an open letter to the school management, through which, dissatisfied with the response received to an initial petition, it requested more documents to be used ""in our future criminal proceedings (Art. 197 Penal Code: Relele treatments applied to the minor), considering that by watching this film that promotes juvenile homosexuality and incites suicide, our children were subjected to psychological aggression and suffered trauma."" At the same time, representatives of the association and parents also organized a protest in college girl.
OBJECTIVE: Increasing homophobic feelings, generating anti-system social movements, promoting the introduction of ultra-religious and ultra-conservative propaganda into the educational system.
Friendship between boys and homosexual propaganda
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The film ""Close"" is nowhere near one that explicitly promotes an LGBT way of life and, categorically, it does not elevate suicide to the rank of a solution for solving problems. Although we are talking about an artistic act, where the interpretation of his message is extremely subjective, we cannot ignore the opinions of specialists in the field: Thomas Rogers, well-known film and literature journalist, contributor to several publications, such as the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, Rolling Stone, Bloomberg Businessweek , New York Magazine s.a., considers ""Close"" to be rather ""a slow-burning drama about two 13-year-old boys, named Leo and Remi, whose close bond causes a revisionist reaction from one of them, then when classmates suspect that they are a couple. After Leo, angry, begins to distance himself from Remi, a series of disappointments turns into tragedy."" Jake Coyle, renowned screenwriter and film critic, says of ""Close"" that it is a film that talks about ""a friendship between two 13-year-old boys, Leo (Eden Dambrine) and Remi (Gustav De Waele), whose intimate relationship is put to the test, tragically, when Leo, trying to fit in with the other, more masculine boys, push Remi away."" Acclaimed film critic Peter Bradshaw sees the film as ""a heartbreaking tale of childhood friendship turned embarrassing.""
Obviously, the author of these lines also has his own interpretation of the film, but it is important to discuss facts now, and not ideas or feelings. But we can't do this without telling the story of the film, so we do the proper SPOILER ALERT here.
Thus, the only allusions to the sexual orientation of the two main characters are the ones that actually trigger the break between them and set the film in motion. They are spoken in an interrogative form, and although Remi's silence and the looks he gives Leo, when he vehemently denies, can be interpreted as an affirmative answer, this is absolutely not an example of explicit promotion. The reasons for Remi's suicide remain unexplained throughout the film, although Leo and the viewer suspect them. Regardless of this, his tragic disappearance does not solve any problem and is certainly not presented as a viable solution. Leo, although tormented by remorse, continues his life with other friends and family, and even finds the courage to confess his thoughts to Remi's mother, who, not surprisingly, hugs him and offers him support. Moreover, at the end of the film we discover that even Remi's parents continue their lives, that's right, starting over in another place, still missing their lost child. In fact, the film rather talks about bullying and its extreme consequences, because the homophobic jokes and remarks of the students in the film cause the break between the two friends. Then, as the director of the film himself states, ""Close"" talks about responsibility and the inability to take too big decisions at an age of still searching, in which the desire to be accepted in the community far surpasses other adolescent experiences.
I spoke by phone with teacher Olimpia Popa, Director of the Education - Health Department within the Parents' Alliance, in order to better understand how the members of the association reached the conclusions stated in the letter addressed to the Central School. Unfortunately, a few minutes after the start of the dialogue, the teacher refused to continue it, on the grounds that ""we are not even remotely part of the same family of spirits"". In addition, she requested that we not even quote the beginning of the dialogue, so that, honorable, as I promised, we will not do it. I also tried to talk to someone from the management of the Central School by phone, but no one answered the phone number displayed on the institution's website. I only had the communique officially given following the initial requests of the Parents' Alliance, in which it is specified that only students who expressed their intention to do so voluntarily participated in the event, as well as the fact that the film, as we explained above, has as its main themes some specific to teenagers, such as friendship, relationships between colleagues, bullying, etc.
In conclusion, although it is extremely likely that the character Remi in the film in question was homosexual, this is absolutely not specified explicitly in the film and in no case can it be considered propaganda. On this principle, any film with mobsters would mean pro-criminality propaganda. In the same way, neither Remi's suicide nor the pain his friend feels afterwards can be considered an invitation to suicide, just as no film about revenge can be classified as pro-killing propaganda.
We will note at the end only the disinformation with which the letter ends, proof that, as in many other cases, the arguments used in conservative actions are simple speculations, distortions of reality or subjective interpretations: ""the two tragic and sudden deaths of two transvestites (so from the ""LGBTQ+"" category) who committed suicide following crises and deceptions similar to those of the suicidal character in the movie Close"", from December 2022, in the city of Iasi, were actually caused, in one of the cases, from a pulmonary edema, and in the other, most likely, from carbon monoxide poisoning following an accidental fire.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: At the Cannes 2022 film festival, ""Close"" was nominated, among others, in the Queer Palm category, a category that awards films from the genre of Queer cinema, in which the subject is related to the LGBTQ community, which is why , very often, these films give rise to controversies.

In reality, NATO does not it is part of the conflict in Ukraine, and the confrontation with the West cannot be considered a war for the defense of the homeland because Russia was not attacked by anyone, but invaded an independent state.
Kremlin spokesman: NATO has become Russia's enemy because it is part of the conflict in Ukraine
NEWS: The spokesman of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov declared in an interview for Izvestia that the collective West, the USA and NATO are the main source of global Russophobia. ""We must not hide the truth or sweeten the reality, but call things as they are [...] NATO has become Russia's enemy because it is part of the conflict in Ukraine in which Ukrainians are killing civilians, including Ukrainians and Russians.
Peskov recalled the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who emphasized that the secret services of the NATO states are working non-stop against us, and their diverse and increasingly modern weapons from a technical point of view are offered free of charge to Ukraine [...]
At the meeting of the FSB college, Putin declared that the West has never shied away from using extremists against Russia in its own interests, having at its disposal all possible means [...]. The danger of terrorist actions on the territory of Russia is increasing due to the actions of Kiev and the West, which will continue to use their ""old friends"".
[...]
It is a rhetoric of the current war to defend the homeland and its future. Undoubtedly, the victory will be achieved by us. Russia was not defeated in any war for the defense of the homeland, despite the large number of enemies and traitors.
NARRATIVE: Russia must mobilize to defeat NATO in the new war for the defense of the homeland.
Reality: Russia is the one that attacked Ukraine, and NATO only helps Kiev to defend itself, without being part of the armed conflict
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, NATO is not participating in the war in Ukraine. Asked by journalists before the meeting of defense ministers from the member states in February if NATO is at war with Russia, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that ""neither NATO nor the allies are part of the conflict"". He repeatedly emphasized that the Alliance it is not part of the conflict, but only helps Kiev, which has the right to defend itself against Moscow's aggression, according to the UN Charter.
The West, regardless of whether we are talking about NATO or the EU, supports Ukraine with humanitarian aid, weapons and ammunition as a reaction to Russia's aggression. After a year of large-scale war, Russian propaganda shifts the emphasis to the narrative about NATO that wants to destroy Russia at all costs, consolidating the image of the external enemy to minimize discussions about the failures of the ""special military operation"". Russian propaganda, citing politicians pro- The Kremlin is again trying to make a narrative ring: the cause is replaced with the consequence. The cause - the invasion of Ukraine - is presented in a deliberately false way as a consequence of the arms deliveries, and these deliveries are called ""a NATO war against Russia"".
The West began sending defensive weapons to Ukraine in the run-up to the February 24, 2024, full-scale invasion, amid concerns expressed by foreign intelligence agencies that Moscow was preparing for war. The support given by the West to Ukraine since 2014 was linked to the war in Donbass, financed by the Kremlin, and the supply of lethal weapons in large quantities - to the large-scale unprovoked aggression of Russia in 2022.
On February 26, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, accused NATO of actively participating in the war in Ukraine and of working to dissolve his country. Putin stated that, by ""sending tens of billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine"", NATO is participating in the war. The Russian government press writes that NATO and Ukraine will finance various terrorist acts on Russian territory and will use the services of extremists, called by Putin ""old friends"" of the West. No evidence is provided that this occurs. In addition, NATO, known as a collective defense organization, has only entered a war once by activating Article 5, and that was in response to the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001. The threat of terrorism, however, remained , the main preoccupation of the North Atlantic Alliance for a long time, until the growing aggressiveness of Russia forced the Alliance to consolidate its positions on the eastern flank - but also to defend itself. Russia's accusations are totally unfounded and would be more in line with Russia's policies in the European space, as the case of a bank in Moscow that finances extremist movements in the EU through money laundering is known.
For the first time, Russia is discussing a new war for the defense of the homeland in order to encourage the mobilization of society and justify military actions on the territory of Ukraine. Russia is shown by the pro-Kremlin press as a victim of NATO aggression, and this conflict acquires symbolic values ​​by comparing the Soviet-German war - called in the ex-Soviet space the ""Great War for the Defense of the Fatherland"" - with the Russian-Western one. ""Russia was not defeated in any war for the defense of the homeland"", according to the Russian press. This message aims to strengthen trust in the authorities, deepening the image of Russia as a fortress besieged by ""evil forces"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aimed to distort the truth about the war in Ukraine. According to Russian media, the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations, and the EU has sent troops to Ukraine before 2022 to weaken Russia. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are freed from Russia. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion starting from November 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

84,586,"Romania is massing troops on the border with Moldova and in Chisinau, even if it denies this",Romania is massing its troops at the border with the Republic of Moldova,False,[],"['Romania', 'Moldova', 'Chisinau']",,,,,,,https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20230228/moldaviya-1854950599.html,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-romania-maseaza-trupe-la-granita-cu-moldova-si-in-chisinau-chiar-daca-neaga-acest-lucru,,01.03.2023,,Moldova,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-romania-maseaza-trupe-la-granita-cu-moldova-si-in-chisinau-chiar-daca-neaga-acest-lucru,,"The Russian propaganda press resumes the false narrative regarding the massing of the Romanian army at the border with the Republic of Moldova after it was dismantled by the press and officially denied by Romania. Mediafax, the press agency that published the fake news in Romania, replaces it without explanation.
In the new version, Sputnik, one of the most famous channels of Russian propaganda, quotes a deputy of the separatist Transnistrian region, who states that Romania is massing its troops on the border with the Republic of Moldova, although Bucharest denies it, Romanian special forces are already in Chisinau, and the security bodies of the Republic of Moldova are coordinated by Romanians. The false narrative of the massing of troops, used previously, was resumed shortly after Moscow officially assumed older disinformation regarding the imminence of a war in Transnistria, but also in the context in which Chisinau accused Russia of preparing a coup in the Republic of Moldova.
NEWS: ,,[...] The concentration of Romanian troops at the Moldovan border is taking place, the deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Moldova, Dmitrii Soin, a veteran of the special services, is convinced. He also recalled that in recent years, the Moldovan forces have been active under the direct guidance of their Romanian colleagues:
""Ever since last fall, I had information from my sources in Gagauzia and Chisinau that since then Romania was present, in the form of special units, force groups, on the territory of the Republic of Moldova. Romanians work there actively, permanently. It is important to mention that it is difficult to distinguish a Moldovan from a Romanian, because the language is the same. Practically, all the employees of the law enforcement agencies in one way or another did internships in Romania. Last fall, there were joint exercises between the Moldovan carabinieri and the Romanian gendarmes. I mean, everything has been preparing for a long time, and now it comes to the surface, when larger units are massed at the border, they are already visible. A concentration of special purpose units is taking place there and an American reconnaissance plane is already flying,"" said Dmitrii Soin on Sputnik radio. NARRATIVES: 1. Romania is massing its troops at the border with the Republic of Moldova, even if the Ministry of National Defense does not recognize this fact. 2. Romania directs the law enforcement agencies of the Republic of Moldova and special groups have been present in Chisinau for a long time.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to accuse Romania, respectively NATO, of military involvement in the Republic of Moldova, of drawing Chisinau into the war. At the same time, they fuel panic and fear among the population.
CONTEXT: The Republic of Moldova can be considered the second target of Russia, in the war started a year ago over Ukraine, if it would succeed in defeating the Ukrainian armed forces. A small and poor state, which has lost almost half of its population since declaring its independence, with part of the territory controlled by a separatist regime subject to Moscow and with Russian troops stationed illegally, the Republic of Moldova can be easy prey.
Since the beginning of the war, the Republic of Moldova has faced several crises and security risks, false bomb alerts, cyber attacks, the airspace has been flown over several times by Russian missiles launched over Ukraine, and parts of them even fell on the territory of the Republic of Moldova. The respective incidents do not seem isolated but part of a hybrid war that the Russian Federation launched against the Republic of Moldova, a war that was also publicly denounced by Chisinau officials.
Besides these security risks, currently the biggest threat is internal destabilization, the pro-Russian political forces, made up of parties and politicians who have criminal problems and are trying to destabilize the situation, including through organized and paid protests, as he discovered investigative press from Chisinau. It is primarily about the party of the fugitive Ilan Sor, who is hiding from justice, having been sentenced by the first court in the case of the theft of the billion to seven years in prison. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenski, informed the European Council about a Russian plan to destabilize the Republic of Moldova, and the leader from Chisinau, Maia Sandu, provided details about that plan, which, in practice, would mean a coup - the term was but avoided - given with the help of foreign mercenaries involved in capturing some institutions and taking hostages.
On the other hand, Moscow inflames the situation with misinformation regarding the imminent attack on Transnistria and even threatens to consider such actions as an attack on Russian territory and troops.
Against this background, the video images with military equipment from Romania appeared, presented by Russian propaganda as a show of force at the border with the Republic of Moldova. The information was dismantled both by the press from the Republic of Moldova and by the press from Bucharest and denied by the Romanian Ministry of Defense, but before this happened, it was taken as such by one of the most famous press agencies in Romania, Mediafax.
Mediafax removes the fake news without explanation, after it has been dismantled
The initial headline on Mediafax was ""Moldova prepares for defense."" The HIMARS missiles, filmed while being transported to the border"". The article at the respective internet address, published on February 27, 2023, was replaced, however, after the removal of the information, by another, signed by the same authors, Alexandru Stan and Sorina Matei , with the publication date of February 28 and entitled ""Ukrainian officials: Russia will initiate a new spring offensive. The Ukrainian army, prepared to launch a counteroffensive"". The initial news does not appear on Medifax even if the search engine on the web page is used, instead the MApN disclaimer appears.

It is one of the cases that clearly shows how Russian propaganda can appear in the Romanian public space, as a result of its takeover by a well-known agency. Many times, however, this is disseminated through social networks or through various controversial characters in the public space. In addition, themes identical to those of Russian propaganda are circulated in the area of ​​the Western radical right, especially American ones, being taken over from there by Romanian publications, or they circulate in circles that promote ethno-nationalism of communist and even legionary inspiration. Finally, these false narratives typical of Russian propaganda rarely attract attention like the subject of the massing of troops, so the authorities do not react with denials and often they are not even dismantled by the press.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FAKE: The article starts from a fake news that Romania is installing its military equipment, anti-aircraft systems, on the border with the Republic of Moldova, launched by a Russian Telegram channel and picked up by several online platforms and Russian websites of propaganda. The information was denied by the Ministry of Defense from Bucharest, which specified that the video images published by the Russian propaganda channels were taken at the end of November 2022, in the center of the city of Alba Iulia, on the occasion of training for the military ceremony organized for the celebration of Romania's National Day .
Moreover, it is not the first time that the propaganda press uses video images of military units in motion to misinform that Romania is massing its forces at the border; such fake news was dismantled by Veridica at the beginning of May, 2022.
Regarding the joint Moldovan-Romanian exercises referred to by the representative of the Tiraspol regime, it is about cross-border projects financed by the European Union, or the planned annual training of the military.
For example, between September 19 - 21, 2022, the international tactical level training exercise with forces in the field (LIVEX) ""Danubius Shield 2022"" took place in Galati, component of the joint training program within the project ""Increasing the professional capacities of staff involved in crowd and riot control operations in a cross-border context"". The project is implemented by the General Carabinieri Inspectorate from the Republic of Moldova and the ""Lower Danube"" Galati County Gendarmerie Inspectorate, through the Joint Operational Program Romania - Republic of Moldova 2014-2020.
Trainings with the participation of the Moldovan, Romanian and other countries' military take place regularly, according to the training plans of the Ministry of Defense. For example, the ""Fire Shield"" exercise takes place annually starting from 2015, and the Moldovan military participates in the ""JCET"" starting from 2009.
False narratives about military exercises are not new either. In the summer of 2021, for example, a fake news appeared according to which the Republic of Moldova wants to join NATO because a platoon of the Moldovan army participated in exercises of the North Atlantic Alliance. Those false narratives ignore the fact that multinational exercises are a routine for many armies and even Russia has participated in such exercises in which NATO countries were also involved, the most recent being hosted by Pakistan at the beginning of 2021.

[...] De facto, Maia Sandu's regime, which can be considered authoritarian, began to violate freedom of speech and human rights, under the pretext of ""limiting disinformation"", imposing the European informational agenda on the population.
Citing false reasons, in one year in the Republic of Moldova, a series of popular resources in the Russian language were blocked.
[...] The most eloquent case was the blocking of six television stations, which supported the Moldovan opposition. Their license was suspended because they were avoiding topics related to Ukraine and, in this way, in the opinion of the authorities, they were promoting the war through silence.
In June 2022, an unconstitutional law regarding the ""defense of the informational space"" entered into force, which became the basis of the fight with the Russian-language press.
[...] Thus, it can be rightly stated that the Sandu regime continues the repression against the Russian press segment based on a template developed by the West, tested in Ukraine and the Baltic States.
We all see what such actions have led to in Ukraine. Moldova follows the same path.""
NARRATIVE: The pro-European government in Chisinau turns into a dictatorial regime which, at the instigation of the West, bans and undermines the Russian press.
The Republic of Moldova, under the assault of Russian disinformation and propaganda
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is the most vulnerable and exposed country in Central and Eastern Europe to Russian propaganda, according to the study ""Resistance to disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe"", carried out in 2018. It analyzed to what extent the 14 monitored states are vulnerable to Russian propaganda according to three indicators: the extent to which the population is exposed to disinformation and propaganda; countermeasures by the state; vulnerability to digital warfare.
The study finds that in the Republic of Moldova there are three large groups more likely to be manipulated by the mass media than the rest of the population. It is about ethnic minorities, speaking the Russian language, which represent almost 20% of the population; some active parishioners of the Orthodox Church in Moldova - which is canonically subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate and has among its ranks prelates who over time have spread false narratives identical to those coming from Russia - and the elders, who represent over 700,000 and whose level of average education is lower than the rest of the population.
""The Russian influence in the Republic of Moldova is very strong, because it is exercised in different ways, including through the numerous media institutions from the Russian Federation that are rebroadcast or republished in Moldova, through the new media and social networks, plus the sources of communication and influence of some political formations and other pro-Russian interest groups"", according to another regional study, carried out in 2017.
""Given Russia's strong informational presence, it managed to systematically manipulate public opinion and weaken social cohesion in the country. Traditionally, the Russian Federation promotes various manipulative narratives related to the Soviet past, implicitly the idea that the Republic of Moldova belongs to the so-called Russian world, Russkii mir. Starting with 2014 - in particular, when the Association Agreement with the EU was concluded -, Russia also promoted narratives directed against the European aspirations of the Republic of Moldova"", according to the Analysis and Strategy for increasing the resilience to disinformation in the Republic of Moldova, developed by one among the most famous think-tanks from Chisinau, the Institute for European Policies and Reforms.
And internal monitoring reports found that Russian TV stations rebroadcast in the Republic of Moldova were used as propaganda tools.
In 2018, the Parliament voted a law that prohibited the broadcast of certain categories of programs such as news, political debates and military broadcasts from states that have not ratified the European Convention on Transborder Television, among these states the Russian Federation. However, the provisions were canceled in 2020 by a parliamentary majority led by the Socialist Party, Filorus.
Parliament voted a similar law on June 2, in an attempt to reduce disinformation in the context of the war in Ukraine.
The Information and Security Service has blocked, since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, several websites that distributed fake news, information that incites hatred, war or violence. These are both online resources in Russian and Romanian.
""There is a need for a regulatory intervention and the institutionalization of a clear mechanism to counter disinformation in the online space. Also, there is a greater understanding of the need to emphasize the activity of countering disinformation when it affects the security of the state"", recommends the Institute for European Policies and Reforms in a public policy document, produced in December 2022.
Recently, the Russian press, pro-Russian politicians from the Republic of Moldova, but also official Moscow criticized the Chisinau authorities for putting pressure on the Russian-language and Russian-language media
OBJECTIVE: To present the pro-European government in Chisinau as a dictatorship that carries out anti-Russian policies. To show that the West, by supporting and encouraging such a regime, does not actually believe in the freedoms it talks about, which it cites only to undermine Russia. To victimize the Russian press, indirectly justifying Russia's military actions and bellicose foreign policy as necessary to defend the so-called ""Russian space"" (russkii mir).
Reality: Chisinau wants to protect its informational space in conditions of hybrid war
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The establishment of censorship and the banning of the Russian media is a topic intensively promoted by Russian propaganda. In fact, the Chisinau authorities took several measures, after the Russian invasion in Ukraine, against propaganda and disinformation, which threatens the security of the Republic of Moldova. Moreover, officials from Chisinau publicly denounced, last fall, the fact that Russia is engaged in a hybrid war against the Republic of Moldova. Such a war also involves misinformation, fake news and propaganda.
The law prohibiting the broadcast of certain categories of broadcasts on TV refers to a certain category of states - those that have not ratified the European Convention on cross-border television. From a legal point of view, the measures taken based on this law were not strictly directed against the media in Russia, so they are not discriminatory.
A second category of measures targets the online space, where the Information and Security Service has identified pages that spread misinformation and blocked them. SIS also blocked websites in Romanian and Russian, as well as the Audiovisual Council warned and fined both Romanian and Russian language stations.
Finally, a third category of measures were taken based on the Audiovisual Code of the Republic of Moldova.
In December 2022, the Commission for Exceptional Situations decided to suspend the license of six television stations that promoted propaganda, but most of them were affiliated with fugitive politician Ilan Sor, involved in financing anti-government protests that were described as part of an effort to destabilize the Republic of Moldova, an objective also pursued by the Russian Federation; moreover, Moscow allegedly sent money and FSB officers to Moldova, who worked with the Sor Party in order to achieve this goal.
The decision was taken ""in order to protect the national information space and prevent the risk of disinformation by spreading false information or attempts to manipulate public opinion"" and was based on ""the multiple findings from the monitoring reports of the Audiovisual Council regarding violations of the Media Services Code Broadcasters of the Republic of Moldova, implicitly the application of sanctions for the lack of correct information in the coverage of national events, but also of the war in Ukraine"".
The establishment of the dictatorship in the Republic of Moldova is another narrative of the Russian propaganda that refers in the same terms to the entire Western world to suggest that there is an authentic democracy in Russia. However, international reports show that despite the fact that it is in a war zone and that during the past year it was in a state of emergency, the level of democracy in the Republic of Moldova has increased.
The Republic of Moldova ranked 69th out of 167 states in the democracy index for 2022, published at the beginning of February by the British research and analysis company Economist Intelligence Unit. The democracy index in the Republic of Moldova in 2022 was 6.23 points, slightly increasing compared to the previous year; also, the country obtained the highest number of points in the last seven years.
""As regards the political criteria, Moldova has a solid base that allows it to achieve the stability of the institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the respect and protection of minorities"", the European Commission states in its opinion on the application for accession of the Republic of Moldova to the EU, accepted in June 2022.
NUTS OF TRUTH: The Chisinau authorities have launched in recent years, but especially in 2022 in the context of the war in Ukraine, several actions aimed at combating disinformation and propaganda, especially from the Russian Federation, given that all the studies and reports it shows an increased vulnerability of the autochthonous informational space in front of these phenomena.

Fake news induces sincere emotions on Russian television
1tv.ru/12 Jul. 2014; novayagazeta.r/14 July. 2014; euvsdisinfo.eu / Feb. 8 2014; 1tv.ru/15 Jan. 2023; youtube.com/gur.gov.ua/19 Jan. 2023; euvsdisinfo.eu/8 feb. 2023
A favorite justification, often invoked by the supporters of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, taken from the Kremlin's propaganda, is that Moscow only reacted to the persecutions, violence, and even genocide to which Kiev allegedly subjected the Russian-speaking population in the east in the last ten years the countries. Vladimir Putin's admirers continue to ignore both the lack of evidence in support of the accusations, as well as the reports documented on the spot by international organizations such as the Council of Europe, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the OSCE. One of the most infamous hoaxes, proven as such immediately after its launch on Russian state television, remained known in the history of forgeries as ""the crucifixion of the boy from Donetsk"". On July 12, 2014, the Pervai Canal news program broadcast an interview with an alleged refugee from Sloviansk. The woman, presented as Galina Pisniak, claimed that Ukrainian nationalists killed a three-year-old child by crucifixion, after which his mother, the wife of a separatist fighter, was tied to a tank and dragged of unconsciousness around the city square, in the eyes of the crowd. The terrible, highly emotional story represents even today an unparalleled culmination of the campaign orchestrated by the Kremlin to incite hatred against Ukrainians. Russian journalists from Novaya Gazeta traveled to Sloviansk and dismantled the fake in less than 24 hours. The alleged witness to the ""crucifixion"" was not a refugee, but an occasional actress identified in several propagandistic productions set up by Moscow. There was no boy, no mother and no wife, just as there was no crucifixion and no Ukrainian tank. Although completely invented, the shocking story achieved its goal, revolting the millions of viewers addicted to Russian state television.
The same pattern, with the same means - although not at the same level of villainy -, can be found in the case of several cynical forgeries promoted by the Kremlin in the year that will soon be fulfilled since the invasion of Ukraine. Last month, the same state television station aired a new story with a great emotional charge at prime time. The news described, in a montage intended to emphasize the drama, the burning by the Ukrainian nationalists, in the northwestern region of Volyn, of an Orthodox church loyal to the Moscow Patriarchate. The comments that accompanied the report accused the Kiev authorities, in a style and tone similar to those used at the alleged crucifixion, labeling the Ukrainians as inhuman or even ""Satanists"". And this alleged information proved to be completely untrue . Local authorities in Volan declared that no fire was reported at any church in the region. It was soon discovered that, to convincingly illustrate the fake, Russian television used images uploaded to YouTube by the Ukrainian Emergency Service in January 2021 , one year before the invasion of Ukraine and exactly two years before the alleged arson. The footage showed an accidental fire in the Dnepropetrovsk region. The original full footage shows Ukrainian firefighters saving icons and other church objects from inside the burning church. Obviously, those sequences were omitted from the anyway fraudulent montage of the Russian television, because it would have proven the Ukrainians' care for religious artifacts and thus would have contradicted the desired propaganda message. The euvsdisinfo.eu analysts highlight the speed of propagation of the fake, which, according to estimates, would have reached over a hundred million people in just eleven days after its appearance on an apparently obscure Telegram channel. The route followed various Telegram channels with increased visibility, online platforms with substantial audiences in Russia and Belarus, the first channel of the state television, ending in the pages of the ""Zvezda"" publication of the army of the Russian Federation. Ironically, as an element of continuity of propaganda on state television, the lie of the burning of the Russian church was presented in the news journal from January this year by the same announcer who in 2014 announced, fueled by the revolt, ""the crucifixion of the boy from Sloviansk"".
The children, sent to the ""front line"" of Russian propaganda
disinfo.detector.media/1 feb. 2023
The public dismantling of the fake crucified child in Sloviansk did not deter the unscrupulous Russian propagandists. At the end of January, a Twitter account with the name ""Donbass Devusca"" - ""Girl from Donbas"" released in the online environment a photo of a chocolate tablet on the packaging of which a boy was drawn wearing a tankman's helmet, lined with black as a sign of mourning. According to the macabre inscription on the packaging, the chocolate would be called ""Death to Aliosca"", and the coat of arms printed in the upper corner suggests that it would be produced in Ukraine. The explanation that accompanied the photo was that the name proved that Ukrainians are capable of hating a Russian child just because he is proud of his country. In just two days, similar messages were distributed on social networks in Spanish, Italian, French and Greek. But who is Aliosca? Alexei Pavlicenko from the Belgorod region appeared in the media space last spring, becoming, at the age of eight, a symbol of Russian war propaganda, an archetypal image of the defenseless who must be saved from the danger of the Ukrainian Nazis. The promotion of Aliosca as a ""hero"" was successful, helped by the channels of federal and regional television, as well as military correspondents, and relied on the most modern PR techniques. It included photo sessions in military uniform, public thanks from the Russian Ministry of Defense, a tour of military schools and the boy's honorary recruitment into among the so-called Youth Army. Aliosca's image was painted on the walls of buildings, he was named the winner of the ""Children of Heroes"" contest and was awarded by the Council of the Russian Federation. The campaign culminated with the release of a limited batch of chocolate named ""Aliosca"", a tribute to the popular ""Alionca"" chocolate that used the image of a little girl in the Soviet era. The governor of the Belgorod region, Viaceslav Gladkov, served President Vladimir Putin himself with ""Aliosca"" chocolate. Russian propagandists also counted on Aliosca's immense popularity, converting it, through a rudimentary lie addressed to the gullible, into a wave of hatred towards Ukrainians. On the other hand, Aliosca's case can be considered as a logical continuation of the Kremlin's criminal policy of militarizing childhood and which, in turn, is a component of the quasi-religious cult of war, omnipresent in Russia today.
""Jorge's team"" - global disinformation mercenaries
derspiegel.com /16 Feb.; theguardian.com / 15 Feb. 2023; haaretz.com / Feb. 15 2015; bbc.com / 19 Feb. 2023
For all those used to believing that hackers' interventions in the decisions of other states, online disinformation of the masses and digital fraud of elections come only from ""bad guys"" who operate in the shadow of governments with questionable democracies, such as those in Russia, China or Iran , the recent revelation of the disinformation activities committed by the so-called ""Jorge's Team"" was shocking. And that's because ""Jorge's team"" - the pseudonym with which Tal Hanan, a former operative in the Israeli secret services, is recommended to clients - casually offered the illicit services listed above to anyone who was interested from a discreet office located in the city of Modi'in , 35 km from Tel Aviv. As shown by the images filmed with a hidden camera broadcast by The Guardian newspaper - one of the 30 publications involved in the investigation - Tal Hanan gave undercover journalists a convincing demonstration of technological capabilities and skills of his team, starting with a software capable of hacking the accounts on the social networks of foreign officials and generating ""armies"" of up to 30,000 bots in social media. Hanan boasted to those he believed that his team had successfully manipulated 27 of the 33 presidential elections in which he had intervened all over the world, including in Europe. The journalists also learned that ""Jorge's team"" was behind the falsification of some campaigns - mostly commercial disputes - in 20 countries, including Great Britain, the United States, Canada, Germany and Switzerland. About the members of his team, Tal Hanan said that they are experts in finance, social media, campaigns and ""psychological warfare"" and that they have training certified by government agencies.
He refused to comment on the publicized report, but denied that he had done anything illegal. Meanwhile, the investigation has already started to have consequences in the media manipulated by the Israeli company. Starting from the information disclosed by ""Jorge"", the popular French television channel BFM TV started an internal investigation targeting a prominent journalist, currently suspended. Among others, Rachid M'Barki was allegedly placed in a news journal from December content not verified by the editorial team. The journalist lamented directly by the editorial team by the editorial team. The journalist directly lamented the new set of European sanctions against Russia, claiming without evidence that ""freezing the properties of Russian oligarchs"" and confiscating their yachts will lead to the disappearance of 10,000 jobs in the yacht construction industry, whose representatives would have asked Prince Albert to intervene in their favor. There is the suspicion that, in this case, the journalist would have acted at the behest of private interest groups. Gone unnoticed on the midnight news, his comment went viral after it was picked up on social media by the fake accounts of Jorge's team. The BBC notes that by ""planting"" such false information on mainstream French television, ""Jorge's Team"" aimed to give massive credibility to simple rumors that otherwise would have gone unnoticed.
Russian propaganda: war crimes are ""good deeds""
hub.conflictobservatory.org / 15 Feb. 2023; euronews.com / 15 Feb. 2023
Russia relocated thousands of Ukrainian children to re-education camps where they receive Russian citizenship, are propagandistically indoctrinated and forcibly adopted by Russian families. This is the documented conclusion of the report published last week by the humanitarian studies laboratory of Yale University, which identified at least 6,000 children between the ages of 4 months and 17 years sent to such camps, although it estimates that the real figure could be substantially higher. According to international law experts consulted by Euronews, the systematic campaign supported by Moscow represents a violation of the Geneva Convention and, given its spread and systematic nature, can be classified as war crimes, if not crimes against humanity. The report shows that in many cases Ukrainian children were sent to Russia from the occupied areas of Zaporizhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk in 43 camps located throughout the territory of the Russian Federation and - most of them - in the occupied Crimea. The network seems to represent the infrastructure of a well-targeted and long-term campaign by Moscow. Ukrainian minors are exposed to Russian-centrist propaganda orchestrated on all levels of education: academic, cultural, patriotic and military, the objective being the denial and suppression of Ukrainian cultural and historical identity. There is evidence that in two camps with a military profile in Chechnya and Crimea, children are taught to handle military equipment, study firearms and learn to drive trucks. In some cases, the children were simply kidnapped. In others, Ukrainian orphans were placed for adoption in Russian families, although the authors of the report claim that not all the children were - technically speaking - orphans, many coming from families that had reached difficulties due to the war. Many parents were forced to alienate their children, agreeing to sign supposedly legal documents in an attempt to save their little ones from the war zone and give them a chance to be properly fed. In the meantime - notes the report -, some of the children returned home, but others were forbidden to communicate with their parents, being prevented from returning to Ukraine. The authors of the study say that the entire operation is coordinated from Moscow and involves every level of the Federation government. The cynical version of the Kremlin - which partially recognizes the relocation of Ukrainian children, but denies its size and forced character - is that the action is a generous humanitarian program intended to help abandoned children.

In reality, Russia, without being threatened in any way, launched an imperial war to bring Ukraine under its control.
NEWS: ""The special military operation is a vaccine for Ukraine against Russia's betrayal, but also a punishment for those who left the country [...], the commander and founder of the People's Militia of the People's Republic of Luhansk, Colonel Vitali Kiseliov, tells URA.RU .
Preparations were taking place then, NATO instructors were arriving in the area, and their military bases were to be defended on the territory of Ukraine. We couldn't wait any longer, we had to strike first [...]. We fight not only against the Ukrainian army, but also against foreign mercenaries, instructors from the West [...].
Ukrainians from the eastern regions are forcibly conscripted into the Ukrainian army by Kraken, SBU, S14. They are mobilized in punishment battalions, coordinated by Zelenski. I know, for example, the city of Kharkiv, which has always been a town of bandits and militia. Now there are some unbearable conditions, all the normal people have left the town.
[...] We cannot accept the erasure of Ukraine from the face of the earth. They are our brothers and sisters, we have relatives there. Yes, they were brainwashed, they were destroyed, but now they don't know how to take revenge on the authorities because the men are forcibly mobilized and sent to the front. They need us, our help [...].
The biggest problem is the fascist ideology in Ukraine, which we will destroy step by step. But it won't be like in 1945 when our grandparents stopped and said they wanted peace. It will be a longer period of time. Large-scale military actions will end this year, but there will be others for two or three years [...].
Demilitarization and denazification will be completed successfully. The Russian people, from Kaliningrad to Sakhalin, must understand that the special military operation is necessary for each of us"".
NARRATIVE: ""The special military operation"" saved Russia from the NATO invasion and Ukrainian Nazism.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: One year after the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, a series of propaganda narratives were published in the Russian government press justifying the ""special military operation"" by presenting it as an achievement of the Kremlin or as a step taken in time to prevent the destruction of Russia by NATO. The interview published by URA.RU summarizes the false narratives regarding the war in Ukraine promoted in Russia starting on February 24, 2022 and dismantled repeatedly by Veridica.
In reality, Russia's aggression against Ukraine was triggered when the latter opted for European integration. The model of liberal democracies and the rule of law is seen as a threat to the authoritarian regime of Vladimir Putin. If Ukraine were to become an EU member state, with the prosperity and stability brought by this status, the Russians would see that this model is also viable in the ex-Soviet states. Russia did not invade Ukraine to defend itself from NATO, and Nazism as a basic ideology in Ukrainian society is a propaganda invention. The West began sending defensive weapons to Ukraine in the run-up to the war and in the context of concerns expressed by secret services abroad that Moscow was preparing to invade. Armament deliveries on a larger scale took place only after the invasion of February 24, 2022, and even then it was mainly about individual and portable weapons.
There are no NATO bases on the territory of Ukraine, as the Russian media claim. They can appear only after the accession of Ukraine to the Alliance, according to the internal legislation and only with the consent of the Constitutional Court, there being a strict regulation by art. 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine. Also, all NATO military bases and training centers can be studied on the interactive map of the Alliance.
At the same time, Nazism and fascism in Ukraine are inventions of Russian politicians. In July 2015, Ukraine prohibited by law any public manifestation of communist and Nazi ideology, so the statement that this state must be ""denazified"" is meaningless. In addition, Ukrainian soldiers participated in the Soviet army's victory over Nazism. Press Russian frequently catalogs nationalist (or even identity) manifestations from the ex-Soviet space as forms of Nazism/fascism. In reality, according to international experts, neo-Nazism and extremism are very important ideological currents in Russia, and especially in the Russian army, becoming tools of the Kremlin's control and manipulation of society through the mass media.
The interview published by URA.RU also contains a series of logical contradictions. If Kiev mobilizes more Russian-speakers in the army against their will, then Russia must send more troops to Ukraine to help the Ukrainians, according to the interview. In other words, killing Russophones mobilized in the army is a form of help from Russia.
In reality, for a long time the Ukrainian army was based on volunteers and soldiers originating from the west of Ukraine. Between 2014 and 2022, many Ukrainians from the west died in the fighting in Donbass, who voluntarily joined the army. After Russia's launch of the large-scale invasion against Ukraine, Kiev made the decision to compel men who have the status of internally displaced persons to register compulsorily after a few days of stay at the military commissariat. This registration does not mean a mandatory mobilization, but it allows Kiev to evaluate its human resources in this war. The decision calmed spirits in Ukraine, reducing this internal cleavage to a minimum. The Russian press, however, built various propaganda narratives from these decisions of Kiev, according to which men with the status of internally displaced persons are persecuted, sent to the front, and women remain without any protection.
Another false narrative about the restraint shown by Russia when it bombards Ukraine to protect civilians, which Veridica also wrote about, is also mentioned. In reality, since the beginning of the war, civilians have repeatedly been the target of Russian attacks, among the notable cases being the bombing of the theater in Mariupol, the railway station in Kramatorsk, the convoy near Zaporozhye, the killing of civilians in Bucea, Irpin, Kiev and others, crimes that are being investigated to bring Russia before international justice.

NEWS: The Ukrainian army is preparing to attack Transnistria. Since the beginning of the year, the experienced formations of the Ukrainian Army are concentrated at [the border with the Republic of Moldova/Transnistrian region], exercises and coordination actions take place. The purpose of the future attack is the military warehouse in Cobasna, which during the Soviet period was the strategic arsenal of the Western Military District.
[...] ""They are ready for any moment. They arranged everything, they even brought the special technique from Bahmut and Donetk. The only thing they fear is that the arsenal could be mined. If it explodes, it could destroy the blocks in Chisinau, like in Turkey. but it is not excluded that he could try and blame the Russians. Ammunition for a year of war is stored there,"" wrote Vladimir Grubnik, citing several sources.
He makes the connection between the aggressive plans of the Ukrainian army and the change of the Government in Chisinau, where the ""civilian"" Natalia Gavrilita was replaced by the representative of the forces, Dorin Recean. A signal of the preparations for aggression is the sending of summonses from the military commissariats to all men suitable for military services, which the authorities present as ""data base renewal"".
In support of this version come the latest statements of the newly appointed Prime Minister Recean that it is necessary to demilitarize Transnistria, to expel the Russian army. the statements come in unison with those of Volodimir Zelenski for Corriere dela Serra that Ukraine is ready to help Moldova.
Military expert Alexandr Artamonov assumed back in January that the attack on Transnistria, which in the west is considered part of Moldova, could also be launched from Romania. Tanks prepared for Ukraine can be used. In this case, the conquest of Transnistria will be only a secondary goal, and the main one will be the fortification of the area around Odessa and the continuation of the attack towards Crimea.
""An armada of approximately 150-200 tanks will concentrate at the border of Romania and descend towards Odessa, crushing Transnistria on its way""
[...] His colleague Vladislav Surighin [...] claims that the newest armament of the Western Military District of the USSR was evacuated from Cobasna or used during the time of the 14th Army general Alexandr Lebedi. ""What is left is unusable. I think they could use some projectiles, but which are over 40 years old. Therefore, it would be a suicidal action"", considered Surighin.
NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova are preparing to attack Transnistria, ruled by a pro-Russian regime, to take control of the military depot at Cobasna. 2. NATO will get involved in the war on the side of Ukraine.
The narratives regarding an attack on Transnistria, a constant of Russian propaganda
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Russian pro-Kremlin press has been writing for years about alleged intentions regarding an attack against Transnistria. Veridica regularly dismantled fake news and disinformation on this topic even before Russia invaded Ukraine on a large scale. Russian propaganda does not seem to be able to decide where the danger to Transnistria comes from, so it wrote, among other things, that the 2022 attacks in Transnistria were organized by the West to attract Moldova to NATO and capture Soviet ammunition, that the United States are preparing to attack Transnistria, that Maia Sandu agreed with Zelenski to attack Transnistria, that in fact the special forces of the USA, Romania and Moldova are preparing to attack Transnistria, or that Romania, together with Poland, Ukraine and Moldova, is preparing to invade Transnistria .
In a style that Moscow has been accustomed to for a long time, after the false narratives regarding the attack on Transnistria were promoted in the pro-Kremlin media, they were also taken up at the official level, and the Russian Ministry of Defense officially stated, on February 23 , that Ukraine would prepare to invade Transnistria.
The Transnistrian separatist region is a relic of the war against the Chisinau government instigated in 1992 by Russia, which also directly participated in it. The region survives as an independent entity thanks to the funding and protection of Moscow, which has deployed two military contingents there: one as a peacekeeping force, the second to guard an ammunition depot that belonged to the former Soviet XIV Army, participating in the conflict since 1992. Russia has not fulfilled its international commitments to evacuate troops and ammunition. Currently, all Chisinau's steps regarding the withdrawal of its armed forces from the territory of the Republic of Moldova are commented by Moscow and Tiraspol as an attempt to destroy the pacification mission, although it is about different things.
In the context of the statements about potential attacks on the separatist region, Russian propaganda also invokes the risk of Romania's involvement, and some media sources have advanced the idea that Romania intends to annex the entire territory of the Republic of Moldova, but also parts of Ukraine.
Thus, Romania is presented as a revansard start, with territorial claims on the Republic of Moldova and some regions in the southeast of Ukraine. Reference is made to the fact that Romania lost these territories in the Second World War, but it is not said that, in fact, they were captured by the USSR after it signed, with Nazi Germany, the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact .
OBJECTIVE: 1. To justify the statements and accusations of the Kremlin leaders that Ukraine is led by a neo-Nazi regime that poses a danger to Russia and Russians. 2. To confirm Moscow's official statements about NATO's involvement in the war in Ukraine. 3. To induce panic among the inhabitants of Transnistria regarding a potential military attack on the region and to present Russia as a ""lifeline"".
Why Russia is lying: Ukraine has its forces concentrated in the east, and NATO has ruled out any involvement in the conflict
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: It is true that some Ukrainian officials have suggested in several cases that Ukraine would be ready to liberate the Transnistrian region from the control of the pro-Russian regime and the Russian military forces, but the authorities in Chisinau ruled it out every time this scenario and reiterated that they are only examining solutions to settle the conflict peacefully.
The statement that Ukraine would have concentrated important professional military forces on the border with the Transnistrian region also raises doubts, given that its army is concentrated in the east of the country to repel Russian attacks.
The authorities in Chisinau have repeatedly rejected claims that appeared in the press or on social media channels about alleged mobilizations or subpoenas to the military commissariats. The last disinformation campaign of this kind appeared recently, and the Ministry of Defense urged citizens ""not to fall prey to misinformation and manipulations"".
A possible government reshuffle in Chisinau has been talked about in the last six months, so the appointment of Dorin Recean, former Minister of the Interior, as the head of the Government has nothing in common with Kiev's alleged plans to attack Transnistria. Moreover, the Government's activity program examines only peaceful solutions to the conflict.
The information about the degree of wear and tear of the ammunition stored in the Cobasna warehouse cannot be verified. It is still certain that if it were to explode, according to specialists' calculations, it would affect both the towns in the Republic of Moldova and those in Ukraine.
The Republic of Moldova rejected Moscow's February 23 statements regarding a Ukrainian diversion in Transnistria as false.
Regarding the alleged intentions of NATO to get involved in the war in Ukraine, again this is one of the basic narratives of Russian propaganda, a narrative that is spread both by the pro-Kremlin press and by officials from the top of the Russian state , who repeatedly said that NATO prepared the war, threatened Russia directly, was fighting it through the Ukrainians used as cannon fodder, etc.
NATO's support for Ukraine is only offered to help that country resist an unprovoked imperial aggression, Russia seeking to bring under its control an independent state. NATO officials categorically ruled out any involvement in a war against Russia (unless Russia attacks a NATO state) and took measures to avoid provoking Moscow: NATO forces in the east carried out their activity strictly in the territory and the airspace of the member countries, the deliveries of offensive weapons to Ukraine were refused, so that this country does not use NATO weapons to strike the territory of Russia.
Due to Russia's aggressiveness in the region, NATO was forced to strengthen its own positions on the eastern border, including in Romania, to ensure the protection of the member states. However, there was no question of concentrations of forces capable of launching offensive operations on a large scale, nor of any ""army"" of tanks.
NUTS OF TRUTH: Some Ukrainian officials have suggested in several cases that Ukraine would be ready to liberate the Transnistrian region from the control of the pro-Russian regime and the Russian military forces, but the authorities in Chisinau have ruled out this scenario each time and reiterated that it examines only the solutions for settling the conflict through peaceful means.

The tectonic conspiracy against Turkey
geo.tv / Feb. 8 2023; reuters.com / 8 Feb. 2023; haarp.gi.alaska.edu
The catastrophic earthquakes resulting in tens of thousands of deaths in Turkey and Syria were an unexpected opportunity for conspiracy theorists to come out on the ramp. While the aftershocks of the February 6 cataclysm amplified the disaster, social networks were filled with messages claiming that the earthquake had no natural causes but was a deliberate operation by NATO or the United States aimed at punishing the disobedient regime of President Recep Erdogan. According to the authors of the posts, the ""weapon"" used by the aggressors would have been a former American military program called HAARP - the acronym for ""High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program"", that is, in Romanian, the Research Program on Active Auroral Frequencies. As an argument, the accusing posts invoke images filmed in the moments preceding the earthquake in which the sky seems lit by lightning, which - the conspiracy theorists claim - is abnormal in the case of earthquakes but happens frequently during HAARP operations. The statement denotes either ignorance or naivety - say the specialists consulted by Reuters. First of all, the HAARP program is based on high-power and high-frequency transmitters intended for the study of the ionosphere, that is, the upper part of the atmosphere located beyond the altitude of 70 km, not even theoretically having the ability to act in the depth of the earth's crust. While radio waves can penetrate less than 1 cm into the Earth's crust, the February 6 earthquake had its epicenter at a depth of 17 km. Secondly, even if artificial radio waves can disrupt limited areas of the upper atmosphere, their effect is limited, being comparable to solar influence. In addition, experts say, the current technology does not allow the precise direction of radio waves from the ground to a specific city. As for the lights in the video, they are not specific to HAARP technology, the researchers say. Instead, contrary to what is claimed by conspiracy theorists, they are a common occurrence during strong nocturnal seismic movements, being determined by short-circuits caused by the fall of electrical networks. On a cloudy night like the one of the earthquake, the sparks that usually accompany the violent interruption of the power supply were reflected by the cloud ceiling, giving the viewers the feeling of electrical discharges in the atmosphere. Beyond these predominantly technical explanations that dismantle the fanciful theories circulated on social networks, there is an answer for those who continue to see HAARP as an ultra-secret and super-sophisticated weapon of the Americans. As of 2014, the ionosphere research program no longer has any connection with the United States Air Force and the U.S. Navy, being completely administered by scientists from the University of Fairbanks in Alaska. According to the institution's website, all study results from 1990 to the present are public. Moreover, any person, regardless of age, passionate about the field or just curious, can visit the HAARP installation in Alaska for free on the Open Day, organized every year.
The seismic plot - shock wave ""Sosoaca""
facebook.com / DianaSosoacaOfficial / Feb. 8 2023
Diana Iovanovici Sosoaca, independent senator:
""I lived to witness the production of earthquakes on demand.""
Diana Sosoaca is convinced that the earthquake on Turkey's border with Syria is the result of Western intervention. He said it bluntly from the rostrum of the Parliament two days after the earthquake, in a speech then posted on the Facebook page, where he gathered over four thousand three hundred likes and more than 3,500 shares. Without getting lost in technical explanations, the senator launched herself into phantasmagoric political pseudo-arguments. managing to compromise any shred of credibility of his own speech.
Diana Iovanovici Sosoaca, independent senator:
""In fact, it is an attack on Turkey by the world's biggest powers, who totally disliked the fact that they were set up by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey. Moreover, his position of neutrality and mediator in the Ukrainian-Russian war deeply disturbed, especially since Turkey is the second great military power in NATO. His position to block Sweden's accession to NATO, but also his speech at Davos, especially his gesture of leaving in the middle of the conference defying Schwab, did not remain without an echo in the hard and cold world of world leaders. (01:38)
The evocation of the Davos meeting, reinforced on the Facebook page by posting a clip showing the moment of Recep Erdogan's untimely departure from the conference, is an obvious disinformation, sanctioned as such by some informed users. The mentioned incident happened in 2009, and the anger of Erdogan - at that time the prime minister of Turkey - started from a heated exchange of words on the topic of the situation in the Gaza Strip with the then president of Israel, Shimon Peres, who died in 2016. Mrs. Sosoaca's mystifications did not stop here, however, the senator suggesting that several Western countries, to which Romania would have been added, knew about the imminent production of an earthquake in Turkey.
Diana Iovanovici Sosoaca, independent senator:
""Twenty-four hours before the earthquake, ten countries withdrew their ambassadors from Turkey. Five days before its occurrence, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a travel warning for Romanian citizens in Turkey, although there is no danger. Likewise, other countries. Killing people, they served their interests.""
Incomprehensible for a politician who declares on his Facebook page ""the only senator!"" and ""the only parliamentarian of Romania!"", Diana Sosoaca confuses the extreme act of withdrawing the ambassador from a state with the temporary closure of an embassy for security reasons . However, nine Western countries have decided to close their diplomatic missions for a short time due to the risk of them becoming the target of violent protests by locals irritated by the recent public burning of the Koran in separate incidents in several European countries. In fact, the same precaution was also the basis of the travel alert issued by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the alert which explicitly mentions the diplomatic zone and places of worship in Istanbul, without reference to the later calamity area of ​​Turkey. Returning to Senator Sosoaca's speech in Parliament, it culminated with a delirious call for a new Revolution ""like in 1848"" and ""a world revolt against the demented and psychopaths"" who rule the world. Among them, Diana Sosoaca nominated the president of Ukraine, labeled as ""the despot Zelensky"". A day later, a photo taken at the Russian embassy showed the Romanian senator smiling with the ambassador Valeri Kuzmin, at a reception where she was presented an account of the so-called ""special military operation"", supplemented by an exhibition of photographs from the regions annexed by force by Moscow.

The unbelievable statement belongs to the lawyer Gheorghe Piperea, known for promoting several false narratives in the public space, and is based on Tarom's decision to print, on the flight tickets, the level of carbon dioxide emissions of the races for each passenger.
There will be devices that will measure how much each person breathes
NEWS: ""The trial continues with the transformation of the common man into a climate criminal. It will be infinitely worse than in the pandemic. As in the case of factories, in order to emit more than the authority allows, you will have to pay certificates. [...] We will pay to breathe, rest assured. As this is the trend, consider that for about 17 years factories and plants have been obliged to buy CO2 certificates annually if they will emit more gases than the allocated quota. [...] And the privileged are kept in the dark, being exempted or always amnestied for pollution (for example, Bayer, Pfizer, the GAFAM club). If it was possible against factories, it will also be possible against individuals. If you are wondering how it will be established to exceed the allocated limit through too enthusiastic breathing, excessive rests or winds against the law, don't do it anymore. Thermal scanners were used in the plot so that we, the laymen unaware of the secrets, would be selected by the great specialists, the security guards at the mall, as ""safe"" customers.
NARRATIVE: People will be taxed on the carbon dioxide emitted through breathing.
CONTEXT: The level of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere has become a concern of specialists since the 50s of the last century. Since 1958, the level of CO2 began to be measured constantly, thus observing an average annual increase in its presence in the atmosphere and, according to the data published in the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, it reached, in 2021, 149% of the level of the pre-industrial era. The main sources of this increase are emissions from burning fossil fuels and cement production. As a result, there is concern that, in the near future, the terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems will no longer have the capacity to effectively absorb the surplus of CO2, and to act as a buffer against the increase in temperature. As a result, the fight against global warming has become extremely important and of maximum interest to more and more people, who are looking to significantly reduce their ecological footprint.
The Covid19 pandemic and Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine have represented two topics that over the last three years have overshadowed the fight that humanity will have to wage with global warming and its catastrophic climate consequences. As Veridica anticipated a year ago, the subject has returned to the attention of public opinion, and the fighters against the ""sanitary dictatorship"" are regrouping on the front of climate denialism. Moreover, a report published in January by the coalition for Combating Climate Disinformation and carried out by a team of experts coordinated by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, finds that in 2022 there was an explosive increase in climate denialism on social networks.
OBJECTIVE: Increasing the level of indignation towards the authorities, provoking protests and revolt movements against European and local institutions.
Human breathing is not a factor in climate change
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Since 2019, surveys have shown that people want to know the exact level of emissions generated when they travel, although formulas for calculating it have existed since 2008. Western railway companies display, on the issued tickets, the level of CO2 emissions for years. As for flights, starting in 2021, search results on Google Flights will show users the amount of carbon emissions of trips, so that a buyer can consider the environmental footprint in the same way as they do with price and duration. The initiative was implemented by the big airlines already that year, and recently, Tarom chose to do the same, although, in essence, the amount of CO2 emissions of an airplane is very little influenced by the number of passengers. Its individual identification on the ticket is rather a measure of increasing the degree of awareness among the population of the impact it has on the planetary ecosystem.
Currently, airlines flying in Europe must present permits from the EU carbon market to cover their carbon dioxide emissions. Most of these (over 80%) are offered by the European community for free. Wanting to put some pressure on the aviation sector to move it away from fossil fuels, the European Parliament decided to gradually reduce the number of free carbon permits, with
25% in 2024, with 50% in 2025, until their complete elimination by 2026. This will mean that airline operators will have to pay for their CO2 permits, thus being incentivized to pollute less, which will leads, most likely, to an increase in plane ticket prices. But obviously, this does not imply an individual tax on the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere through breathing.
Moreover, scientists say that human breathing is not a factor in the climate changes generated by greenhouse gas emissions, since the carbon dioxide removed enters a natural circuit, which includes CO2-absorbing plants. On the other hand, the carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of fossil fuels is additional and accumulates in the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse effect.
NUTS OF TRUTH: A possible source of inspiration for the false narrative regarding the oxygen tax would be the fact that for many years there have been so-called ""oxygen bars"", presented either as a solution to escape, for a while, from excessive pollution (in cities like New Delhi), either for recreational purposes or in the name of benefits of oxygen therapy (which however belong to the area of ​​alternative medicine). In the respective bars, which are private initiatives, customers pay a fee to consume oxygen. Publication / Media:

In reality, he only spoke about the Russian soldiers who invaded Ukraine and must be stopped, without mentioning the Russian people or the Russian speakers in the Ukrainian regions.
Russian propaganda: Kiev threatens the Russian people with a genocide of large proportions
NEWS: ""The Kiev regime has exceeded all limits and intends to organize a genocide of the Russian people. The need for such a genocide of such proportions and carried out very quickly was argued by Mihailo Podoliak, adviser to the head of the Zelenski administration. On the show ""We are Ukraine"" of a television station, the Nazi called for the destruction of thousands of Russians a day. He says that this is the only way in which Kiev will be able to achieve victory in the war.
""We must not have 1,000 funerals for Russia per day, but 2,500, 3,000 or even 5,000. Only in this way will the completion of this war take place. Only destruction, destruction and destruction,"" said Podoliak, requesting new tanks, planes and missiles for Ukraine.
[...]
Podoliak's words were commented by publicist Armen Gasparian. He believes that the Ukrainian nationalists surpass the Hitlerite fascists in their wickedness. ""Even the Nazi Einsatzgruppen did not intend to carry out such terrible murders in the past.""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine will organize a genocide of Russians, with the planned daily killing of 5,000 people.
The statements of Zelensky's advisor refer to the Russian military that invaded the Ukrainian state
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the adviser to the President of Ukraine, Mihailo Podoliak, analyzed the possibility of ending the war in Ukraine through the prism of the dynamics of the battles on the front. He said that Moscow brought a lot of soldiers to the territory of Ukraine, mobilized in the fall of last year, that's why in order to achieve a victory in the war, the Ukrainian army must kill between 2,500 and 5,000 occupiers per day, and not 1,000 as at the time of face. This calculation was made by Podoliak at the request of Ukrainian journalists who asked him when the war will end. The estimate regarding the current losses of the Russians belongs to Podoliak and Veridica could not verify it from independent sources.
The Russian government press took Podoliak's statement out of context and did not mention that he spoke about the Russian soldiers who arrived on the territory of Ukraine.
Zelensky's adviser did not speak about the Russian people or Russian speakers, but about the need to improve the efficiency of the Ukrainian defense against the invaders sent to Ukraine by the Kremlin. Russian propaganda presents the invaders as victims of Kiev's actions, and Ukraine is shown as a part of the conflict that does not defend itself, but only aggresses the Russian people. The purpose of this propaganda narrative is to justify the war in Ukraine and presented the Ukrainian state as a danger to the existence of Russia.
It should be mentioned that Ukraine's actions correspond to the norms of international law. In accordance with the UN Charter, Ukraine exercises its inherent right of self-defense against Russian aggression. According to a report of the Council of Europe, Ukraine has the right to liberate all occupied territories within its internationally recognized borders and to regain full control over them. Self-defense and the liberation of one's own territories cannot take place without killing the soldiers of the aggressor state.
The accusations regarding the genocide carried out by Ukraine are devoid of any legal basis and evidence. In reality, it is Russia that has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. Moscow is bombing Ukrainian towns and has destroyed numerous civilian targets, including apartment buildings, schools, power plants, etc. The crimes are documented by journalists and independent investigators. Some evidence (satellite images, drone footage) unequivocally attests that the Russian military committed war crimes in the Kiev, Kherson or Kharkiv region. Ukraine asked the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send investigators to gather evidence of war crimes.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that were launched with the aim of exonerating Russia and blaming Ukraine or the West for committing war crimes. According to Russian propaganda, the EU hides its involvement in the crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine by establishing a special court.
The Russian press also wrote that the American experts consider that the news about the atrocities of the Russian military in Ukraine are an invention of the Ukrainian propaganda. The propaganda narrative was also dismantled, according to which the UN admitted that the Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for military purposes. Publication / Media:

In reality, Zelenski's message is taken out of context, he is speaking for the Russian military who participate in the invasion without having ""yachts and banks"".
Russian propaganda: Zelensky laughs at poor Ukrainians
NEWS: The President of Ukraine made an unexpected statement. The politician cannot understand what the citizens of his country are fighting for. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky finally presented his own thoughts. He spoke without the help of prompters from the West, his speech being a spontaneous one. The citizens of the Ukrainian state who are taken to the front were also amazed. In the end, even the president of Independent Ukraine does not understand what they are fighting for.
""Do any of you have oil rigs?"" Do you have palaces? Do you have a living? Or maybe you have yachts or a bank? What are you fighting for? You only have loans, something to eat in the evening and now the mobilization,"" said Zelenski. The video of his speech became viral on the networks.
NARRATIVE: Zelenski mocks the Ukrainians who fight against Russia.
Reality: Zelenski addressed the Russian military, trying to convince them that it is not worth fighting in a foreign country
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the president of Ukraine has never derided his fellow citizens who are fighting against the aggression of the Russian Federation. On the contrary, during the last year, Zelenski tried, through his speeches, to encourage resistance and raise the morale of the military, but also of the civilians. The main messages of Volodymyr Zelensky were, every time, that Ukraine needs the help of the West and that Russia will be stopped by the fearless Ukrainian people.
The words quoted by the Russian press belong to Volodymyr Zelensky, but they do not refer to Ukrainians, but to Russians. The propaganda narrative is built on the basis of a video message of the Ukrainian president from the fall of last year, in which he asked the Russian military, in Russian, to stop, not to give their lives for Vladimir Putin and the great rich of Russia. He asked the Russians if they have ""palaces, vineyards, yachts or banks"" to fight for on the territory of Ukraine? Zelensky also urged the Russians to fight for localities in their country and not to accept being sent to the territory of a foreign state.
The message was published on the official communication channels of President Zelensky on September 28, 2022, but it was used by Russian propaganda only a few months later with the aim of discrediting the Ukrainian authorities and blocking the process of enlisting in the Ukrainian army, as well as exploiting to the maximum the effects of war fatigue in Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news distributed by the Russian press with the aim of manipulating public opinion regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine, while the mothers and wives of Ukrainian soldiers killed in the fighting are protesting the war. The Russian press wrote that Zelenski killed over 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army, and the EU states will ask Ukraine to surrender to Russia. Publication / Media:

In reality, the EU did not send in the past and does not participate even now in military actions on the territory of Ukraine.
The spokeswoman of the Russian MFA, Maria Zaharova, says that the EU has soldiers in Russia
NEWS: ""The spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said that the European Union sent soldiers to Ukraine long before 2022. Zakharova wrote about this on her Telegram channel, commenting on the statement of the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, according to which ""the European Union has not considered and is not considering the possibility of sending soldiers to Ukraine"".
""The army of the EU member states has been sent to Ukraine for a long time. And in the form of instructors, and in the form of special services and in the form of mercenaries. Their sending started long before 2022"", said the diplomat.
Previously, Maria Zakharova stated that the EU-Ukraine summit held in Kiev confirmed that Brussels continues to support the neo-Nazis in Kiev who serve the interests of the United States and NATO to weaken the Russian Federation"".
NARRATIVE: The EU sent troops to Ukraine before 2022 to weaken Russia
Reality: the EU states have excluded the option of sending troops to Ukraine because they want to avoid a direct conflict with Russia
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the EU has not sent and does not intend to send soldiers to the territory of Ukraine to support the Ukrainian army. The spokeswoman of the Russian MFA justifies her state's invasion of Ukraine, continuing the propaganda metanarrative launched last fall, according to which Moscow is fighting NATO and the EU on the territory of the Ukrainian state. The Russian press has reported in the past about foreign mercenaries on the territory of Ukraine, but without providing evidence.
The head of European diplomacy declared on February 5 that Ukraine deserves support, but without the direct military involvement of the EU member states. ""Non-military behavior means not directly participating in the war. We would have been part of the conflict if we had introduced the troops, which was never on our agenda,"" Josep Borrell told ""El Pais"".
Instead, Zaharova declares that the military and instructors from the EU states are in Ukraine a long time before, but this time too she does not provide any evidence. In fact, the West began sending defensive weapons to Ukraine around the time of the war and in the context of concerns expressed by secret services abroad that Moscow was preparing to invade. Armament deliveries on a larger scale took place only after the February 24 invasion and even then, initially, it was mainly about individual and portable armaments, precisely because there were fears that Russia might consider itself provoked by armaments hard.
After the invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops, the International Legion was founded, in which soldiers from 55 countries of the world, including Russia and Belarus, fought. According to the spokesman of this legion, Damen Magru, the participation of the fighters in the war has an individual character, all soldiers being subordinated to the Ukrainian command. There are no other foreign combat units on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU has been supporting Ukraine since the first days of the war. In addition to humanitarian and financial aid, some EU states take care of the training of the Ukrainian military, provide technique and equipment. The training of the Ukrainian military does not take place on the territory of Ukraine, but in the European states, which means that the foreign instructors are not in the conflict zone. The EU finances the armament of Ukraine, necessary for an effective defense against the aggression of the Russian Federation.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine, according to which the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. During the military actions, Russian journalists reported that the inhabitants of the Zaporizhia region were waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion starting from November 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

It also states that Natalia Gavrilita would have been publicly humiliated by the unexpected change and resumes several false narratives that would show that the pro-European government in Chisinau is dictatorial and deeply anti-Russian.
Russian press: Maia Sandu publicly humiliated Natalia Gavrilita. The president wants to purge the opposition and intensify anti-Russian policies
NEWS: The President of Moldova, Maia Sandu, dismissed the Government to appoint another, but the same. She competed in compliments on social networks to Prime Minister Gavrilita, thanking him for his ""sacrifice and efforts"" against Moldova's enemies who ""wanted war and bankruptcy"". He did not manage to sweeten the pill. Gavrilita considered his resignation a public humiliation, because he learned about it, like the other ministers, from rumors on social networks. She stated that she left with the feeling of mission accomplished.
[...]
Moldovan analysts assume that Recean's background in the field of power structures will allow him to purge the opposition even more brutally. The Gavrilita government has already put the most prominent opponents of the government under house arrest, closed the Russian-language press, banned the ribbon of St. George and decided to demolish several emblematic monuments.""
NARRATIVES: 1. An authoritarian regime led by the pro-European Maia Sandu was established in the Republic of Moldova. 2. The pro-European government in Chisinau eliminates the opposition. 3. The government in Chisinau is anti-Russian: it closes the Russian press, destroys Soviet monuments.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On Friday, February 10, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Moldova, Natalia Gavrilita, announced her resignation, which, according to the legislation of the Republic of Moldova, entails the resignation of the entire Cabinet of Ministers. On the same day, President Maia Sandu appointed his advisor on security, former Minister of the Interior, Dorin Recean, as prime minister. It must be invested by the Parliament, but the PAS leader, Igor Grosu, has already announced that he will have the support of the parliamentary majority.
Natalia Gavrilita, who held the mandate of prime minister for a year and a half, did not explain the decision, but in the briefing in which she made the announcement, she referred to the complicated period (the war in Ukraine and the consequences on the economy and security, the pandemic and high inflation , the energy crisis) and the achievements of his government, citing obtaining the status of a candidate country for EU accession.
The change of prime minister was interpreted in Chisinau as a reaction to the slowness of judicial reforms and a sign of possible tensions within the government. However, none of these reasons were cited by the main actors - President Maia Sandu, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita and Prime Minister-designate Dorin Recean - who all spoke about the increased security risks to which the Republic of Moldova is exposed during this period. Later, three days after Natalia Gavrilita announced her resignation, Maia Sandu publicly denounced a Russian plan to violently remove the government from Chisinau.
OBJECTIVE: To present the pro-European PAS government as an authoritarian and dictatorial regime, supported by the West. To induce panic among certain categories of citizens, especially national minorities, about the ""dangers"" of the pro-European PAS government.
Reality: the prime minister leaves only if he resigns or is dismissed by Parliament. Anti-Russian policies, an invention of Moscow's propaganda
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Republic of Moldova is a parliamentary country, and the government is invested and can be dismissed, by motion, by the Parliament. The President has secondary duties when appointing the government - he appoints the candidate after consulting the parliamentary factions and appoints the Government after obtaining the vote of confidence from the Parliament. No matter what pressure was put on Natalia Gavrilita behind the scenes, the decision to resign belongs to her.
And the statement that Natalia Gavrilita was publicly humiliated after learning about her dismissal on social networks is a lie. Natalia Gavrilita announced her resignation in a press briefing. The resignation of the Prime Minister entails the resignation of the entire Cabinet of Ministers. Moreover, both Maia Sandu and Dorin Recean took care to mention the achievements of the Gavrilita government and avoided making public any criticisms they had; on the other hand, Natalia Gavrilita did not criticize the two and did not let it be understood that she was hostile to them or humiliated her.
The resignation of the Government and the appointment of Dorin Recean as a candidate have been talked about since the autumn of last year, so the decision announced on Friday is not an unexpected one, as politnavigator claims.
The establishment of an anti-democratic regime in the Republic of Moldova is one of the theses promoted by Russian propaganda, which regularly denounces what it calls the pressure on the opposition and the persecution of its leaders - leaders who have criminal problems for corruption and even prison sentences in the first instance (the case of the oligarch fugitive Ilan Sor). The opposition leaders who would be oppressed by the government are the former pro-Russian president, Igor Dodon, who appears in several open files on a series of accusations, including treason, and the vice-president of the Sor Party, Marina Tauber, who appears in two files of illegal financing of the formation, but which was also arrested in 2019, when Igor Dodon was in government.
The fact that the two are under judicial control and not under house arrest, as requested by the prosecutors, can be a proof of the fact that the government does not control the judicial system.
The Republic of Moldova ranked 69th out of 167 states in the democracy index for 2022, published at the beginning of February by the British research and analysis company Economist Intelligence Unit. The democracy index in the Republic of Moldova in 2022 was 6.23 points, a slight increase compared to the previous year and obtained the highest number of points in the last seven years.
The establishment of censorship and the banning of the Russian press is another topic intensively promoted by Russian propaganda. In fact, the authorities in Chisinau took several measures, after the Russian invasion in Ukraine, against propaganda and disinformation, but they were not directed strictly against the media from Russia or from another country. The law prohibiting the broadcast of certain categories of broadcasts on TV refers to a certain category of states - those that have not ratified the European Convention on cross-border television. SIS also blocked websites in Romanian and Russian, just as the Audiovisual Council warned and fined both Romanian and Russian language stations.
In December 2022, the Commission for Exceptional Situations decided to suspend the license of six television stations that promoted propaganda, but most of them were affiliated with the fugitive politician Ilan Sor.
The Republic of Moldova rose in the Press Freedom Index, developed by the international organization Reporters Without Borders (RFF), from 89th place in 2021 to 40th place in 2022.
The so-called decision to demolish Soviet monuments is another fake. Such misinformation appeared in the public space, starting from a statement by deputy Doina Gherman. She was asked in an interview when a decision will be made regarding the Soviet monuments and she declared that she would discuss it with her colleagues, being intercepted by some mass media as a fait accompli.

Romanians are encouraged to stop buying Western products, to stop working in corporations and to stop participating in the democratic process, as Japan did to become an economic power after the Second World War. The example with Japan is simply a fake. The catastrophic results of sovereignty and isolationism are shown by the failure of the states that chose this path.
NEWS: ""It is impossible to be Romanian and not notice that your country is slowly sinking. No matter how stupid and brainwashed you are, you cannot help but see that the big foreign corporations have the economic monopoly and that the politician obviously protects their financial interests. And now, because the industry and the natural and mineral resources have already been taken from us, we have moved on to the second phase: the purchase of agricultural land. During the Turkish, Hungarian, Austrian or Russian rule, you were only a serf; you had a piece of land, and the masters took tribute from you. Now you will be a slave; you will have nothing, and the masters will do what they want with you! It's as if we lost a war and now the invaders are methodically annihilating us.
[...]
- Orient yourself towards the agricultural products market of the Romanian peasants. For now, they also put chemical fertilizers... but not really the poison that the big foreign corporations put in. Ask them to sell you clean products. You have no idea what a sincere prayer can do.
[...]
- Stop using foreign services. Withdraw your accounts from their banks, or move them to Romanian banks. For maintenance utilities, build local facilities: solar panels, thermal plants, water wells with own pumps, etc. Don't let foreigners take your money for anything.
- Try not to hire foreign companies. At first it won't be possible, because there aren't many Romanian companies left. But as we recover economically, move to companies with domestic capital.
[...]
- Stop participating in their corrupt game of ""democracy"". It's a trick and a strategy to legitimize foreign domination! They will grin in your face and say: ""You voted for your representatives, listen to them!"". But they are already corrupted by your conquerors! They do not represent your interests, but those of foreigners. You can't expect anything good from them."" NARRATIVES: 1. Romania became the property of foreign corporations. 2. The Japanese economic miracle is repeatable by refusing to purchase imported products. 3. The only solution for freeing the country from occupation is a closed economy, in which interactions with capital and foreign products are completely absent. Politically, liberation can only be achieved by abandoning the democratic process. 4. In Romania, democracy did not work, it only meant the occupation of the country by foreigners and the loss of independence.
CONTEXT: Sovereignist, anti-Western ideas are a reality of political life in most liberal democracies, where they have been taken over by different formations (populists, right-wing and left-wing extremists to a certain extent and by parties that are not at the extremes the political spectrum), so-called opinion leaders or influencers, a certain type of media (especially online), etc. The real popularity and influence they have differs from one case to another.
Such ideas are also promoted by the Russian Federation, on the one hand to present itself in antithesis with a West presented as decadent, immoral and rapacious (for its own image) as well as to undermine Western values ​​- which represent the main threat to the regime Putin, obsessed with keeping such values ​​away from Russians - and democratic countries, which he regards as geopolitical adversaries. Moscow sought and continues to seek to maintain direct relations with sovereignist circles in democratic states and, in parallel, through disinformation campaigns, fake news and propaganda, it has been promoting such themes and narratives for years. The online environment is extremely important for the propagation of sovereignist narratives and themes, especially because, by its very nature, it allows masking the origin of this disinformation and fake news, at least at the level of a superficial search.
With the invasion of Ukraine, Russia increased its propaganda interventions in the countries that support the Ukrainian cause, with the clear aim of generating tensions within the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance, on the principle of ""divide and rule"". In the former communist countries , still captive to some historical narratives of Stalinist origin, the Kremlin's propaganda camouflages its own manipulations in domestic issues, apparently of exclusively local interest. In Romania, generating an extremely toxic primitive type of patriotism, Russia feeds the public space with false Eurosceptic and anti-NATO narratives, many among them already dismantled in the pages of Veridica, such as the desire of the Romanians to leave the EU and NATO, because the European Union plans to poison the population, assassinate patriots and drag the country into war.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the EU and NATO, promoting the sovereignist discourse, as well as generating protest movements and civil disobedience generating economic crisis.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Romanian economy is not at all under the control of foreign capital, although, indeed, in some sectors, it is predominant or even has a monopoly. An analysis of private companies, differentiated according to the source of the capital, shows that the share of companies with Romanian capital in the turnover is approximately equal to that of foreign companies. The problem of the Romanian capital is the quality and not the quantity. With a number of employees working on domestic capital twice as many as those ""enslaved"" by foreign capital, the economic results are approximately equal. Add to these statistics the number of those working ""for the state"" and thus the image of a people working for prosperity halogens becomes extremely unclear.
Retail trade, the economic sector that generates perhaps the biggest controversies related to product quality and prices, is more than 55% a Romanian business. In much higher percentages, so are transports, the food industry, construction, agriculture, the HoReCa industry or health businesses. We also mention that, apart from the extractive sector of oil and natural gas, where the proportion of foreign capital exceeds 95%, in the rest of the extractive activities, Romanian companies have a share of 80%. And if we are talking about an extremely hot topic of recent years, Romania's forests and wood, it is good to know that 93% of the companies whose activity is ""Forestry and logging"" are Romanian. And we are only talking about private companies, without taking into account the largest owner and exploiter of forest funds in the country, the state company Romsilva.
Post-war Japan was a country effectively in ruins, with a demoralized population. Its great cities were just piles of rubble and ashes. Years of American bombing had destroyed most of the country's industrial capacity. Astronomical hyperinflation had almost buried the national currency, and living conditions were miserable, the majority of the population not having access to the means to satisfy the most basic needs. Under these conditions, it is absurd to believe that someone allowed themselves the luxury of refusing certain products based only on their place of production. In addition, with an industry on the ground, it was practically impossible for the production of domestic goods to satisfy the needs of the entire population of Japan. The absurdity of the story is also highlighted by the premise from which the entire narrative construction starts: ""American concerns had occupied all the economic niches."" If all were occupied, how did the local entrepreneurs manifest themselves? In fact, the Japanese economic miracle is equally due to American policy (the Dodge Plan) and the enormous resilience capabilities of the Japanese people. Worried about the expansion of communism in Asia, the Americans realized that a free and strong Japan could be a decisive factor in stopping this phenomenon. Thus, the US actively encouraged the integration the Japanese economy in world trade. Gradually, Japanese products entered other markets, which also stimulated an increase in imports. During the Korean War, 1950 - 1953, the Americans bought huge quantities of food and war materials from Japan It was basically a considerable transfer of wealth from American taxpayers to the Japanese economy, along with other aid pumped into the Japanese economy. Combined with an extremely rigorous fiscal policy, but above all with an extraordinary educational policy, they ultimately led to an economic revival so fast that it was, rightly, considered a real miracle.
However, there is no need for economic history lessons to demonstrate that the feasibility of a hermetic economy, in which financial and human capital moves only in a narrow space, is null. It is enough to take a look at the economies of countries such as North Korea, Iran or Cuba, isolated (voluntarily or not) from the global economy, to understand that such a model can only work in the very short term, and then more on a declarative level rather than concretely. But the most recent and eloquent example is, although there are voices that support the opposite, the Russian economy. Subject to economic isolation and unprecedented international sanctions, it shows signs of major regression, although the country has, in theory, huge resources in the most varied fields. The urge to consume only local products is oxymoronic from the start. The large store chains are already supplied with many Romanian products, which are more accessible from all points of view (financial, logistical, etc.) than imports. But, in the absence of a constant supply chain, it is obvious that the differences between the demand and the supply capacity of the local market are covered by imports. In addition, there is an extremely wide range of products that can only be procured through imports, from food to electronic devices. As a personal curiosity, we would like to know how the population would be warned about the danger generated by foreign capital only with the help of Romanian production means of communication. The idea that an agricultural producer would give up the use of poisonous substances on the basis of prayers is, at best, a joke. The same is true of giving up financial services provided by foreign corporations. The biggest financial loans in this country were given by Romanian companies (Dacia Felix, Caritas, Bancorex, Astra Asigurari, Carpatica Asigurari, Banca Carpatica, FNI), and, when it was possible, Romanians' savings and investments were saved with the money from the guarantee funds established by foreigners. And rethinking the career on a patriotic model sounds quite loud, given that, according to all statistics, the average salaries in companies with foreign capital are double compared to those with Romanian capital.
But one thing is certain. Democracy in Romania not only works (it's true, with many syncopes and at a distance from ideal standards), but the country is currently going through the best moments in its entire history. From individual liberties (including the right to free expression of admiration for criminal dictators) to objective statistical data, everything shows that compared to the years when imports of goods accessible to the population were zero, Romania has progressed enormously. The GDP is five times higher, and the purchasing power of an average salary is more than double. In the last resort, the whole plea for liberation from the yoke of foreigners is actually one for giving up democracy, as it is clear from the end of the analyzed article. And this, we hope, needs no further comment. Publication / Media:

The misinformation was launched by the former foreign minister Adrian Severin, a former criminal detainee, with strong Muscovite affinities. In reality, both the EU and Romania have offered aid to Syria.
NEWS: ""The Romanian government is trying to excuse its inhumane inaction regarding the sending of aid to Syria, respectively to our fellow Syrians struck by fate, just as, otherwise, it excuses all its atrocities (including those that directly affect the Romanian people), lazily throwing the blame is on the sanctions to which the EU has condemned Syria (in fact, let's say, without a basis in international law) and on Romania's obligation, as a disciplined member of the EU, to religiously apply those sanctions. [...] The inhumanity of the Romanian government towards Syria, hit hard by a natural calamity that exceeds imagination, is not the effect of treaties or European policies and can neither be explained nor excused by them. It is the effect of the imbecile and imbecile servitude of those who form the current Romanian government and the current leadership of Romania, in general."" NARRATIVES: 1. Lacking humanity, Romania refuses to help the hard-pressed Syrian people, at the behest of the West. 2. Romania's foreign policy is dictated from Brussels.
CONTEXT: Adrian Severin is a former Romanian foreign minister and MEP caught while accepting bribes for influence peddling and sentenced to prison for this. Since his release, he has started to constantly promote sovereignist and anti-Western theses, similar to those that appear in the narratives spread by the Kremlin. After the start of the invasion in Ukraine, the ex-detainee even continued to take over several theses of the Russian war propaganda.
For some time, the ex-politician turned criminal has been expressing his opinions on solidnews and in the broadcasts of the radio station associated with this portal, Gold FM, a station sanctioned for spreading false information by the CNA. Both media channels are associated with Cozmin Gusa, a controversial politician/analyst/consultant/businessman who has promoted false narratives over time and has been described by the Romanian press as a Russian close/sympathizer/agent of influence.
It should also be noted that Russia has been the main supporter of the regime of Basar al-Assad for years, despite the brutality of this regime towards its own population. Initially, the support was political and went as far as protecting the Assad regime in the UN Security Council, when Damascus used chemical weapons against its own population. Later, Russia even intervened in the Syrian civil war, bombing civilian targets, including hospitals. Moreover, the brutality of the Russians earned at least two of the generals who fought in Syria, Aleksandr Dvornikov and Sergei Surovikin, the same nickname - ""the butcher of Syria"". Both generals were later appointed commanders of the Russian forces in the war on a large scale started in Ukraine, a war about which both Adrian Severin and Cosmin Gusa and their media channels spread false, pro-Russian narratives.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the population's trust in the EU and NATO, promoting the sovereignist discourse, indirectly supporting Russian interests in Syria.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Despite the devastating effects of the earthquake on the population and infrastructure already severely affected by the civil war, Syria only asked for international aid two days after the earthquake. In the first days, the Syrian government refused to reopen the country's borders for the transit of humanitarian convoys. The decision can be explained by the desire of the officials from Damascus not to allow aid to reach the territories under the control of the anti-government rebels. This approach was not a novelty, for several years the UN has been dealing with the problem of humanitarian assistance for the population of northwestern Syria. However, from the first moments of the outbreak of the humanitarian crisis in the two countries, the European Union announced that it would help both Syria and Turkey by all means. In addition, the Swedish presidency decided to activate the integrated mechanism for a political response to crises (IPCR) in full mode to coordinate EU support measures, in close collaboration with the European Commission. Thus, the EU announced that it will offer a first tranche of 3.5 million euros in the form of emergency humanitarian assistance for Syria, to help people in difficulty have access to shelters, water and sanitation, to various health items that they currently need, as well as to support search and rescue operations. At the same time, the European Commission approved additional emergency support to both countries in the amount of 6.5 million euros in one of the largest search and rescue operations in history, through its civil protection mechanism. For its part, Romania, through the voice of the head of the DSU, Raed Arafat (born in Damascus, Syria), announced that it will send humanitarian aid to Syria, the details to be finalized in these days. It is obvious, however, that all the steps of the Romanian government will have to be coordinated with those of the community, strictly for fluidity, efficiency and the shortest possible implementation times.
Regarding the loss of Bucharest's decision-making independence in favor of Brussels, we are dealing with the eternal thesis of Russian and pro-Russian propaganda, the direct continuation of the thesis of the Cold War period regarding the usurping and exploiting West. In fact, Romania is the one that requested to be accepted in the EU and made the commitment that, as a member, it would accept and adopt the common rules for all member states. And although Romania's economic strength is not as great as that of the majority of member states, it is, legally, a member with exactly the same rights and obligations as the others.
SAMBURE DE AVDEVAR: The Romanian authorities have announced that Romania will only send humanitarian aid to Syria and not rescue teams, because, at this moment, the maximum number of rescue teams allowed by the national emergency strategy is in Turkey. Publication / Media:

The meta-narrative of Ukrainian Nazism has been used by Russia to justify its aggression against the neighboring country since 2014, although right-wing extremists are politically irrelevant in Ukraine and Nazi ideology is prohibited by law.
NEWS: The recruitment of volunteers in the Nazi troops was announced in Kiev. The formation of nationalist brigades, called the ""Offensive Guard"", was announced according to the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, quoted by the PolitNavigator correspondent. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine is in charge of the formation of additional brigades within the National Guard, the National Police and the Service State border.
Among the Nazi brigades in which volunteers can register are Azov, Cervona kalina, Liuti and others
[...]
""Complete the volunteer survey and join the assault brigades of the MAI, which will liberate the cities of Donetsk, Lugansk and other occupied territories, including Crimea [...]"", says the ""Offensive Guards"" page.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine recruits volunteers in some Nazi brigades.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine announced that it is looking for volunteers to form brigades to participate in the liberation of territories occupied by the Russians. It is about 8 brigades, each with its own name, which refers to key moments of the Russian invasion starting with 2014: ""Burevii"", ""Cervona Kalina"", ""Kara-Dag"", ""Rubij"", ""Spartan"" ""Azov"", ""Liuti"" and ""Stalevii Kordon"". It should be noted that, in many armies of the world (including the Romanian army) the military units bear names that can relate to history, geography, tradition, etc. The Russian press seeks to promote the idea that the use of the names of some ""Russian"" territories is a proof of nationalism and Nazism. In reality, it is about Ukrainian territories invaded by Russia.
The so-called ""Offensive Guard"" would, at the same time, operate in support of the army. There is no question, therefore, of Nazi or nationalist para-military formations.
In fact, since July 2015, Ukraine has prohibited by law any public manifestation of communist and Nazi ideology. The far-right formations have never been in government in Ukraine, obtaining low scores in the elections.
Since 2014, the Russian government media has been intensively promoting the metanarrative ""Ukraine is a Nazi state"" to justify Russia's aggression. The Kremlin has never provided credible evidence to support its theses regarding Ukrainian ""Nazism"". For Moscow, everything that does not coincide with the ideology of the ""Russian world"" is a Nazi. One of the goals of the ""special military operation"" announced by Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 was the ""denazification"" of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine and the leadership in Kiev. According to Russian propaganda, the Ukrainians do not understand that they are freed from Russia because they are being manipulated by Kiev. Also, Moscow would show restraint when bombing Ukraine because the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. The Russian press also wrote that Volodymyr Zelenski united Europe to destroy Russia, just like Adolf Hitler, and the authorities in Kiev are massacring civilians in Donbass. Publication / Media:

The narrative is thrown onto the market after, previously, Ukrainian refugees were the target of a campaign aimed at discrediting them. In reality, international organizations and leaders welcomed the way in which the Chisinau authorities and Moldovan citizens mobilized to help the refugees from Ukraine.
NEWS: ""Ukrainian authorities have left the refugees from abroad in the lurch, and the Chisinau authorities have even less concern for Ukrainians.
A pregnant refugee kneels at an intersection in Chisinau, and a Moldovan woman offers her help.
According to the refugee, she has been waiting for help from Moldova for two months. He did not receive the aid promised by Maia Sandu, but neither did he receive money from Ukraine. Her husband serves in the Ukrainian Armed Forces."" NARRATIVE: Abandoned by their own country, Ukrainian refugees are badly treated in the Republic of Moldova
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, on February 24, 2022, more than 8 million Ukrainian refugees have left the country, according to UNHCR. Of these, over 750,000 crossed the borders of the Republic of Moldova, and on January 31, almost 109,000 (mostly children and elderly people) were on its territory, a number similar to that of Romania and Slovakia, states with financial and logistical capacities much bigger. A UNDP study, carried out in September 2022, finds that ""Moldova hosts the largest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita, which has dramatic effects on the budget"". Moreover, currently, Ukrainian refugees represent approximately 4% of the population of the Republic of Moldova, a share comparable to that of Poland, which hosts the largest number of Ukrainians fleeing the war.
The first large waves of refugees were registered shortly after the beginning of the war. Then placement centers were created, tens of thousands of people were accommodated by individuals.
On the other hand, Russian and pro-Russian propaganda from the Republic of Moldova tried several times to create a negative image of Ukrainian refugees, launching an online campaign against them. The refugees were presented as profiteers, or people who cause disorder. Veridica dismantled such fakes several times.
OBJECTIVE: To inoculate the idea that Ukraine's neighboring states, as well as the international community in general, are saturated with Ukrainian refugees who no longer receive support and are forced to beg. To induce the idea that Ukraine abandons its own citizens. To create additional pressure inside Ukraine in favor of capitulation.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Apart from the statement of the woman in the video images that she is a citizen of Ukraine, there is no proof of this. It is not clear whose passport he is presenting, it cannot be verified if he really does not receive help from the Moldovan authorities (by the way, it is not even certain that the registration was made in the Republic of Moldova) and if it is not beggar by profession"". She does not say anything about her husband who would have joined the army, as Donbasstoday writes.
Apparently, it seems to be one of the most well-known manipulation techniques - generalization - when a separate case is presented as an absolute trend or state of affairs in order to misinform the public.
The Republic of Moldova has made significant efforts, compared to its financial resources, to manage the flows of Ukrainian refugees, a fact recognized by officials and international organizations. ""The Government of Moldova has shown leadership in responding to the protection needs of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine"", UNHCR notes on its page, and the representative of the organization in Chisinau, Francesca Bonelli, stated that the Republic of Moldova is an example, including for European countries, of the way it managed the refugee crisis.
In the first six months since the beginning of the war, more than 65,000 people were registered and accommodated in the 130 provisional centers and temporary placement centers for refugees, the Single Crisis Management Center announces.
Also, the natural persons who accommodated refugees received financial support in several installments, offered by the Government and international organizations.
And from this year, refugees will receive temporary protection, which will offer them more rights and social facilities.
Approximately one thousand refugees have officially engaged in the labor field, although it is assumed that their number is several times higher, only that they work unofficially
Not only the authorities, but also Moldovan citizens, economic agents, civil society have offered and continue to offer support to refugees from Ukraine. Dopomoha.md is a mutual aid platform, created and facilitated by ""Moldova for Peace"" volunteers, coordinated by the Government, which provided aid to approximately a quarter of a million refugees.
The false narrative also ignores the cause of the waves of refugees: Russia's large-scale attack against Ukraine and the Russian military's disregard for international conventions of war, which bombed and continues to bomb civilian targets, including residential buildings, targeted refugee convoys, executed and tortured civilians. It is the Russian army that forced people to flee for their lives - and Ukraine, which is under a lot of pressure anyway, has neither the ability nor the obligation to support these internal refugees, whose situation is regulated of the UN Convention for Refugees.

Mass graves and torture chambers were discovered in the south of Ukraine, which show how humane the behavior of the Russians was in reality.
The pro-Kremlin press claims that the Russians even tried to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers
NEWS: ""The Russian soldiers were an example of a humane attitude at the beginning of the special operation in Ukraine,"" said the mayor of Nova Kahovka, Vladimir Leontiev, in an interview for UKRAINA.RU.
The special military operation lasted 11 months, being necessary for objective reasons: Ukraine was preparing for war. The Russian military tried to avoid any loss of human life from the beginning of the operation, Leontiev said.
When the special military operation began, the Russian side, the armed forces of the Russian Federation did everything possible to avoid loss of human lives, including in the ranks of the Ukrainian army. I saw this with my own eyes. The Ukrainian military were notified in advance that the Russian army was going to attack them in order not to cause casualties. Here is a great example of human attitude, he said"".
NARRATIVE: The actions of the Russian military in the Kherson region are an example of human behavior.
In reality, the occupation was brutal, and many Ukrainians disappeared or were tortured
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: To build this propaganda narrative, the Russian government media quotes Vladimir Leontiev, presented as the mayor of the city of Nova Kahovka. In reality, Leontiev is not the mayor of this locality, but a member of the occupation bodies of the Russian Federation. He entered the Nova Kahovka city hall building at the same time as the Russian troops, being named ""head of the civil administration"". After Ukraine liberated the city on November 15, 2022, the Russian media began to name Leontiev mayor, inviting him on various shows to tell the Russians about ""the city occupied by Ukraine"".
Vladimir Leontiev does not represent the residents of the city, being accused by the General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine of collaborating with Russia. At the same time, the mayor of Nova Kahovka, Volodymyr Kovalenko, told in July 2022 about the terror organized by Russia against civilians. The mayor stated that people were disappearing from the streets, and some were being tortured for their political beliefs. Journalists, teachers, local councilors disappeared without a trace from the city, who were seen as a danger for the occupation authorities of Russia.
Video images from March 6, 2022 from the town of Nova Kahovka, distributed on social networks, shocked the world. Even in the first phases of the ""special operation"", Russian troops opened fire on a protest against the Russian occupation, injuring several people.
After the liberation of some towns in southern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that, in the Kherson region, the Russian army ""left behind the same atrocities as in other regions"". He promised to ""find and bring to justice every criminal"".
A team of researchers from the Humanitarian Research Laboratory at Yale University's School of Public Health published a report in November 2022 documenting 226 cases of arrests and disappearances of people from the Kherson region during the Russian occupation. Ukraine has invited specialists from the West to support Kiev's efforts to document the war crimes committed by Russia. Veridica dismantled a series of fake news regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. Also, according to Russian propaganda, half of the soldiers of the Ukrainian army are foreigners, which means that NATO is participating in the war, and the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine.

In reality, digital currency is just another form of existence of money.
""Digital currency is the mark of the beast"". Orthodox fundamentalism and modern financial systems
NEWS: The so-called ""currency"" is linked to your social and territorial situation - if you don't have social credit, that means you are not a good (submissive) citizen, and if you don't use the ""currency"" in a circle with a radius of 1.5 km in which you live, is cancelled. The house, the car, the bank deposits have no value anymore, because no one can buy them. To be able to sell and buy, you must wear the mark - since it sticks you to the place where you sit like a slave and forces you to glorify everything that comes from mastery in order to survive, it is the mark of the beast.""
NARRATIVE: The global satanist occult will bring humanity under control by imposing digital currencies.
CONTEXT: On January 25, the Treasury of Great Britain published a job announcement for the position of head of the digital currency department (Central Bank Digital Currency - CBDC), which will be created in partnership with the Bank of England, an opportunity for the well-known lawyer Gheorghe Piperea - known for promoting false narratives in the public space - to bring back to the public space the narrative of the satanic plot aimed at suppressing the liberties and rights of mankind. Theories already dismantled in the pages of Veridica are combined, such as that of ""digital camps"" or that of ""ecodictatorship"" that will push humanity towards a feudal social system, to which they add a religious component, in tune with the stirrings of the sovereignist community orthodox from the last period, according to which prayer has become a crime.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing in public opinion the idea that digital currencies aim to control some occult forces over people.
Digital currencies issued and regulated by the state, just a new financial instrument
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The certainty of the introduction of a digital currency by the Bank of England is shattered from the first paragraph of the job description in the announcement: ""The successful candidate will be responsible for leading the work of Her Majesty's Treasury Department regarding a potential pound digital - a digital currency of the central bank of the United Kingdom"".
Regarding CBDCs, it is obvious that the opinions expressed by Piperea are emotional, intentionally manipulative and lacking a minimum understanding of the digital currency concept. The characteristics of a CBDC may differ depending on the objectives pursued and the chosen structural model. This means that there is no single model of CBDC, each country being able to choose, if it will choose to issue such a currency, how it will behave and what will be its uses.
The hypothesis, currently not implemented, launched by the Chinese government, to impose a period of validity of the digital yuan, is speculated totally wrongly by the lawyer Piperea when he announces the financial apocalypse and the disappearance of the concept of saving. The Chinese digital currency could have an expiration date, but this is only in order to increase the degree of use of the digital yuan among the population. People will always have the option of converting digital yuan into physical yuan, if they remain unused. In addition, the concept of digital currency expiration could be used to prevent the loss of money, if CBDCs are held on a physical medium offline. Thus, once the term of validity of the currency has expired, the central bank automatically reimburses the last registered account, even without the need for a request for this purpose. If you want a slightly forced analogy, the expiration of a bank card does not imply the loss of money, and the bank automatically issues a new one.
In principle, the success of any project depends on the degree of penetration of the society. Thus, it is almost impossible to believe that a currency with a validity period will be accepted by the population. By its very definition, the digital currency is just another form of the national currency, so it obeys the same rules, being at the same time an obligation of the central bank towards its clients (the population) and a means of preserving value. In any case, Gheorghe Piperea ""forgets"" to mention the source of the information based on which he announces that the CBDCs will be valid, sometimes 45, and sometimes 60 days. The introduction of a digital currency does not directly follow the replacement of cash, the new form having only a complementary role, just like the bank account. Own assets will have the same fixed value as before, it being regulated by the same supply and demand mechanisms.
In essence, the implementation of a CBDC would facilitate monetary flows and centralize financial processes more efficiently, but in no case will it bring the end of the freedom that Professor Piperea is talking about. And the best evidence in this regard is the fact that the apocalyptic scenario could have been very easily staged for some time, through mobile phones and bank cards associated with them.

101,603,NATO is preparing the territory of the Republic of Moldova as a future theater of war,the Republic of Moldova is armed to become a new theater of war,False,[],"['NATO', 'the Republic of Moldova']",,,,,,,https://www.rubaltic.ru/article/politika-i-obshchestvo/20230126-podrazhaya-zelenskomu-mayya-sandu-vedet-moldovu-k-stolknoveniyu-s-rossiey/?fbclid=IwAR3NOh68MTxBKRP6xCJTodfNlehJJOXZJIvrW5AFaK3XYXyfMDGjl0W6PfY,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-nato-pregateste-teritoriul-republicii-moldova-ca-viitor-teatru-de-razboi,,31.01.2023,,Moldova,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-nato-pregateste-teritoriul-republicii-moldova-ca-viitor-teatru-de-razboi,,"The government in Chisinau is bringing the country closer to NATO, which supplies the Republic of Moldova with weapons to prepare it as a future theater of war against Russia, writes the Russian press, which brings as an argument the delivery of 3 (THREE) armored personnel carriers by Germany. It is another plea for neutrality that ignores the facts that show that, in fact, for Russia, neutrality only means accepting its hegemony and that it is ready to attack neutral countries that do not want to be in its sphere of influence.
The Russian press writes that, because it received three armored vehicles, Moldova wants to join NATO and is preparing for war like Russia
NEWS: ""All the latest actions of the pro-European government of the Republic of Moldova and the statements of the officials speak of the fact that it is heading unequivocally towards NATO integration, which will undoubtedly lead to a confrontation with Russia. The only thing that can prevent this is the neutrality statute in the Constitution. But Maia Sandu will solve this ""problem"" and lead the country to a bright future, just as the ""president of peace"" Vladimir Zelenski did.
The processes taking place in Moldova demonstrate that it is being prepared for its role as a future theater of military actions, after the ""war to the last Ukrainian"" that NATO is waging against Russia, will be completed. It is not necessary to remind that the expansion NATO to the east and the clear intention of Ukraine to join it constituted that ""red line"" that caused the necessity of the special military operation.
[...]
It is known that the direction towards the EU goes through collaboration with NATO. Therefore, it is not surprising that the neutral Republic of Moldova began to expand its collaboration with the bloc, directed, first of all, against Russia.
Now the process of pumping NATO weapons into the Republic of Moldova following the model of Ukraine, in order to force the country to give up its neutral status, to push it to solve the Transnistrian problem by means of weapons and to draw Russia into the conflict. For example, at the beginning of January, Germany sent him a batch of ""Piranha"" armored personnel carriers and other equipment.
[...]
The current government of Moldova, fulfilling the instructions of its curators, is consciously drawing the country into a conflict with Russia, turning it into a new theater of military operations. However, they understand very well that observing the status of neutrality is a sure guarantee of security, compared to collaboration with NATO.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The Republic of Moldova is armed to become a new theater of war. 2. Military neutrality is the safest peace solution for the Republic of Moldova. 3. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was provoked by NATO's eastward expansion. 4. NATO is waging a war against Russia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova is provided for in the Constitution voted in 1994 by a leftist parliament. Maintaining the status quo is promoted by pro-Moscow politicians, who present it as a guarantor of the country's security.
The collaboration of the Republic of Moldova with NATO started back in the 90s, and one of the most important projects of NATO was the evacuation of important quantities of pesticides, left over from the Soviet era and which represented a danger for environmental pollution and soil and water poisoning.
However, the North Atlantic Alliance is still presented as a scarecrow for a good part of the population of the Republic of Moldova, who sees it through the prism of Soviet propaganda and, more recently, of the Russian Federation.
The approach of the Republic of Moldova to the EU is viewed critically by Moscow and pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau. Theses about the preparation of the Republic of Moldova for a war against Russia, its involvement in military conflicts, the use of infrastructure by NATO to support Ukraine in the war with Russia have intensified in the last period of time, the aim being to fuel the citizens' fears and negative attitude against NATO.
On the other hand, the war in Ukraine brought back to attention a fact known for many years in Chisinau, but ignored by the authorities: the armed forces of the Republic of Moldova are insufficiently equipped and prepared to defend its territory in the face of aggression. In this context, ways to strengthen security were discussed and the provision of the army with equipment to cover defense needs was identified as a priority. At the same time, the possibility of security being obtained by joining a defensive alliance was also discussed, but no step was taken in that direction, and such an approach would, anyway, be complicated and long-lasting because it would require not only amending the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova - joining NATO, for example, involves not only the procedure itself (a country must request to be accepted and fulfill a set of criteria, allies must accept and ratify, etc.)
OBJECTIVE: To induce fear about the danger of the Republic of Moldova's involvement in a large-scale military conflict (against Russia) if it continues to approach the West (NATO) and, thus, to cause pressure on the authorities. To inoculate the idea that neutrality is the only security solution for the Republic of Moldova.
Russia advocates neutrality, but attacks neutral countries
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The thesis that joining NATO inevitably leads to a confrontation with Russia is a false one, promoted in recent years by Moscow largely to justify its aggressions and efforts to maintain/restore the empire. The largest (and last) expansion of NATO to the east was in 2004, and this did not cause confrontations or attacks on Russia. No state threatened Russia, the Alliance being a defensive one. On the contrary, the invasion in Ukraine determined two of Russia's neighbors - Finland and Sweden, two traditionally militarily neutral states, to request NATO membership because they felt their security was even more threatened than during the Cold War and the USSR.
The thesis that neutrality is the best solution for ensuring security is combated by the behavior of Russia, which invaded Ukraine, a neutral country and whose sovereignty and integrity it ensured, together with other great powers, through the Budapest Memorandum of 1994.
In a somewhat similar situation is the Republic of Moldova, on whose territory a Russian military contingent is stationed and an enormous military warehouse is located. At the same time, a frozen conflict is maintained on the territory of the Republic of Moldova with the Transnistrian separatist region, supported financially and militarily by Russia, whose army was directly involved in the military conflict with Chisinau in 1992.
And the narrative that Ukraine was determined from the outside to fight against Russia is a false one. First of all, it was not Ukraine that attacked Russia, but Moscow announced the so-called ""special military operation"" for the denazification of Ukraine, a false argument, meant to compare Ukraine with Nazi Germany, from which a good part of the Russian population still has the aftereffects after the Second World War. It is difficult to identify any gain of the West from this situation, since the effects of the war hit hard in the European economies, which causes social discontent and financial efforts (including to support Ukraine ).
The 3 ""Piranha"" armored personnel carriers that the Republic of Moldova received from Germany in January (3 have already been received) will be used to ""modernize and strengthen the defense capabilities of the National Army"", the Ministry of Defense announced at Chisinau. It would be hard to imagine to what extent these can be seen as preparations for an attack against Russia, a country that boasts an arsenal of tens of thousands of armored vehicles, from tanks to transporters. Similarly, it is difficult to see how the 33.8 thousand square km territory of the Republic of Moldova could be a theater of war that NATO is preparing against Russia.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: Several officials from Chisinau have recently spoken about the need to strengthen defense capabilities, and President Maia Sandu stated in an interview for politico.eu about the need for discussions regarding a possible accession to a larger alliance that - ensure his security. However, she specified that this would happen within a democratic process. Publication / Media:

In reality, Zelensky said that the decision to deliver tanks by a single state is important, but insufficient, and requested the help of all Ukraine's partners.
NEWS: ""President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that the delivery of tanks to Ukraine cannot change much the situation on the front, according to an interview given to the German television station ARD, published on his Telegram channel.
The Russian army, which has thousands of tanks, is fighting against us, and no state by its decision to offer 10, 20 or 50 tanks will solve the problem. [...]
Previously, Zelenski criticized German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his indecision whether or not to send combat vehicles to Ukraine.""
NARRATIVE: Zelenski admitted that Western tanks will not change the situation on the front in Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian press took out of context Zelenski's statement about several dozen German tanks that ""can't solve the problem"", without also quoting the continuation of this phrase: ""Tanks produce an important thing: they motivate our soldiers to fight for their values, because it shows them that the whole world is with them"". The leader from Kiev added that one state cannot solve the problem, but all of them together have enormous capacities.
What Zelensky said about the Russian army is also not presented correctly. He said: ""The Russian army is fighting against us, which has thousands of tanks, but which has no fighters because they are not motivated"".
The propaganda narrative appears after the Kremlin claimed that the delivery of Western tanks to Ukraine invaded by Russian troops ""will not change anything"" in the situation on the ground. ""Such deliveries (of tanks) cannot change anything fundamental, (but) they will create new problems for Ukraine"", said the spokesman of the Russian presidency, Dmitry Peskov, accusing the Western countries of maintaining the ""illusion"" of a possible Ukrainian victory ""on the battlefield"". The fake news about Zelensky appeared as a confirmation of Peskov's statements regarding ""the illusion of a Ukrainian victory"".
In reality, Moscow is worried about the delivery by the West of some tanks to Ukraine precisely because they could change the balance of forces. The Kremlin has warned Berlin that the tank deliveries will further damage relations between Russia and Germany. Ukrainian military experts claim that Western tanks would allow Ukraine to stop the Russian offensive in several directions.
Veridica dismantled a series of false Russian narratives regarding the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, the West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine, and the United States has armed Kiev since 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine, knowing that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. In order to convince public opinion of the necessity of mobilization in Russia, the Russian press wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and a possible NATO aggression.

The narrative was launched by the independent senator Diana Ivanovici Sosoaca, in a dialogue with Luis Lazarus, and has as its starting point the debate initiated by the implementation of the law on the records of persons and identity documents of Romanian citizens.
Diana Sosoaca: ""Your children will no longer belong to you""
NEWS: ,,Diana Sosoaca: Through this damn ordinance, a new system was implemented for me, a private accredited body for the special protection of the child. Accredited private body, (type!) BARNEVERNET. It was established in Romania, good people. Do you understand what is happening? Accredited private body. (screams again!) BARNEVERNET. Intended for the special protection of the child, temporarily or permanently separated. The Smicala case, do you remember? Five years... [...] It's hard for me that parents will be threatened that their children will be taken away and whatever you do, your child will be taken away, and these accredited private bodies will immediately demand the release of such ID cards, yes? [...] They didn't do it through 272 per 2004, I don't remember that something like this has passed through the Romanian Senate. Can you guess what they did? Because it happened to us before that it was written to the committee in some way and [...] after we voted, it changed. [...] It is unimaginable what is happening, good people! I couldn't believe it. Accredited private body. This is BARNEVERNET (scream!). Barnevernet is private, I talked there, I also had meetings with some personalities from there. [...] These institutions, such as Barnevernet, as you have heard, which are private, which are actually some NGOs, which receive a lot of money and which have the right to enter your home and snatch your child, and it will reach you. Luis Lazarus: Absolutely unacceptable! D.S.: I say, ""I have the law 272"", he says, ""destroy it for you, like they destroyed it here too"". Your children will no longer belong to you. Fight as much as you can for your children. L.L.: Do you realize what an aberration? Since when can an NGO or a private company replace the state and the family and come and do such crap to you? D.S.: Since when is it possible in other countries."" (Luis Lazarus-Zeus TV, from min 03:02:10)
NARRATIVES: 1. In Romania, there will be private bodies that will be able to dispose of Romanian children as they please. 2. In the Romanian Parliament, laws are changed secretly, without informing the members elected by the people. 3. State institutions with responsibilities in the field of child protection will be replaced by private bodies, which will implement their own agenda, totally contrary to the interests of the Romanian people. 4. ID documents with chips will be used for population control.
The narratives about the abuse of children in the West, specific to Russian propaganda
CONTEXT: At the beginning of the month, the Romanian Ministry of the Interior put into public debate a draft law that brings some changes to the emergency ordinance no. 97/2005, which regulates, among other things, the form and content of identity documents. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Diana Sosoaca, who has practically dedicated her entire parliamentary activity to the fight against the global occult that plans the extermination of the Romanian people, once again gives proof of an extremely rich imagination and, relating to a minor modification of an article in the ordinance, launches another phantasmagorical scenario, just as it did in the case of the blackout scheduled for the holidays for the assassination of patriots or the anti-Covid vaccine that gives sterility for three generations. The scenario launched by the independent senator aligns with an entire narrative thread built against electronic identity documents, with roots in ultra-religious conservative propaganda, maintained for years from Moscow, on top of which it superimposes narratives found in conspiracy theories such as PizzaGate and QAnon, adapted to the ethos Romanian in the adoption cases of Sorina Sacarin and those of the separation of children from their parents in Norway. In fact, Sosoaca did not even try to hide her sympathy for the Kremlin's policy, as she is close to the Russian embassy in Bucharest, which she visited several times, under different pretexts.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the authorities and the entire political class, demonizing the West, as well as promoting the sovereignist, anti-Western discourse.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Throughout her entire argument, Diana Sosoaca demonstrates a flagrant lack of knowledge of the country's laws, despite the fact that her profession is that of a lawyer. The legislative amendment that would destroy the future of children consists in changing the phrase ""a simple identity card or an electronic identity card can be issued before reaching the age of 14, at the request of one of the parents"" to ""an electronic card can be issued identity before reaching the age of 14, at the request of both parents"". In addition, references to the accredited private bodies that the independent senator fears appear in law 272/2004 no less than 29 times, even having a specially dedicated section, chapter 8, even if ""I don't remember that something like this would have passed through the Romanian Senate"". Moreover, private bodies that carry out activities in the field of child protection were regulated, until the law on the protection and promotion of children's rights, as early as 1997, by a decision of the Ciorbea government. In essentially, they are represented by the NGOs active in the field of child protection, which will have an even more important role in the field with the implementation of the program to abolish orphanages under the tutelage of the state.
The accusation that the laws are modified after approval by the Parliament, an extremely serious one, is only supported by an argument that has nothing to do with the subject. In the particular case of the child protection law, the proposal to update the law is identical to the update published in the Official Gazette of June 30, 2022. In fact, the amendment does not bring anything new related to accredited private bodies, compared to the regulation in force since 2004. And if this had happened with other normative acts, there would have been enough voices to draw attention to some cases that can definitely be categorized as attacks on national security.
The claim that Barnevernet is a private body is a gross falsehood. In exact translation Child Protection, the Norwegian institution is one of public law, established on the basis of a law from 1992, subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Children and Family. The increased level of the senator's ignorance is highlighted both by the argument ""I discussed there, I also had meetings with some personalities from there"", as well as by the confusion of the Smicala case (spent in Finland) most likely with that of the Bodnariu family. And, although the Norwegian institution has been the subject of several scandals over the years, this fact does not automatically imply similar scenarios in Romania.
In fact, the problem raised by the people's senator is not so much about the separation of children from the family, as about the release of electronic identity cards for them, a fact that will lead, in her view, to a control of evil forces over children. Contrary to the opinion of conspiracy theorists, identity documents with embedded chips do nothing but reduce bureaucracy and make it easier to solve various citizen needs in relation to the authorities. Electronic identity cards represent a normal step in increasing the degree of digitization, without any connection to any occult interest or satanic plots. Despite the conspiracist pot constantly promoted by Diana Sosoaca, a person's request for an electronic identity card is a voluntary option, Romanians still having at their disposal the alternative of a simple identity card, which will not be able to be manipulated by the Western elites.

In reality, the West is supporting Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression, which has committed war crimes and caused enormous destruction and a refugee crisis in the EU.
NEWS: ""The aid offered to Kiev by the Western states in the framework of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict will determine the expansion of the special military operation with the aim of ensuring Russia's security,"" declared the deputy of the State Duma, the representative of Crimea, Mihail Seremet.
""The more Western states get involved in the internal politics of Ukraine, the more the area of ​​the special operation will expand, in order to create a buffer zone and avoid our state's proximity to the enemies"", said Mihail Seremet in a dialogue with RIA news
The deputy of the State Duma also recalled the statement of the American authorities supporting Ukraine's offensive in Crimea and Donbass. ""The Kiev regime must understand that the support of Western states will have the opposite effect to that expected by Ukraine and the authorities,"" Seremet said.
NARRATIVE: The West is forcing Russia to expand its military operations in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the West supports Ukraine with humanitarian aid, weapons and ammunition as a reaction to Russia's aggression. The ""special military operation"" which is an act of unprovoked aggression against a neighboring state, initially aimed to change the political leadership of Ukraine and subordinate Kiev to Moscow's political interests.
The West began sending defensive weapons to Ukraine in the run-up to the invasion on February 24, 2024, in the context of concerns expressed by secret services abroad that Moscow was preparing for war. Western support for Ukraine since 2014 has been linked to the Kremlin-funded war in Donbass, and the supply of lethal weapons in large quantities to Russia's large-scale unprovoked aggression in 2022. Russian propaganda, citing pro-Kremlin politicians, he tries to achieve, not for the first time, a narrative ring: the cause is replaced by the consequence. The cause - the invasion of Ukraine - is presented in a deliberately false way as a consequence of the arms deliveries.
The Russian aggression was condemned by most of the world's states. 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine and that it is a terrorist state. A series of international mechanisms have been launched to designate Russia as a state that finances terrorism.
The UN also asked Russia to cease fire, not to attack civilians and non-military infrastructure. In November 2022, the General Assembly voted a resolution in favor of creating a compensation mechanism for the destruction caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Despite this fact, Russian propaganda continues to present Moscow's act of aggression as a necessary step to defend itself from NATO, the EU and the West. The statement of the Russian deputy is a threat to the West, a psychological pressure made in order to block the arms deliveries to Ukraine. Ukrainian specialists drew the attention of European readers that Moscow relies on a series of ""sounding boxes"" that amplify the messages of Putin, Lavrov and Medvedev, with the aim of sowing fear in the West and leaving Ukraine without support.
The purpose of this narrative is to prepare Russian society for the continuation of hostilities in Ukraine by expanding the ""theatre of war"", but also to influence the capitals of the West to stop supporting Kiev with weapons.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that had the same political goal. According to Russian propaganda, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press also wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. In order to convince public opinion of the necessity of mobilization in Russia, the Russian press wrote that Minsk and Moscow are forming a joint military group to defend themselves against Ukrainian terrorist attacks and a possible NATO aggression. Immediately after the invasion of Ukraine, the pro-Kremlin press accused Ukraine of wanting to join NATO in order to attack Russia. Publication / Media:

According to her, in Ukraine, taking over the parishes would be a first step towards the capture of Bucovina by Romania, and in the Republic of Moldova, the government from Chisinau will liquidate the Metropolitanate of Moldova, subordinate to the Russian Orthodox Church. The material contains several false narratives, intended to propagate a series of various theses, including that Romania would have an expansionist policy and Ukraine would be an artificial state.
NEWS: ""Patriarch Daniel was in Chisinau where he requested that the building of the former Theological Seminary in Chisinau and other buildings be returned to the Romanian Orthodox Church. He also requested the compensatory assignment of a building in exchange for the former headquarters of the Metropolis of Bessarabia, where the current building of the Government of the Republic of Moldova was built (the source does not specify that the old building was destroyed during the Soviet period, n.ed.).
[...] ,,According to the leader of the PACE Party, Gheorghe Cavcaliuc, at the order of the president Maia Sandu, the law enforcement forces launched a campaign against the priests, who are being swindled, and compromising materials are being manufactured in their name.
""As expected, the pressure on the Metropolitanate of Moldova began. If the metropolitan thinks that he will be left alone - he is wrong"", commented deputy Bogdan Tirdea""
NARRATIVES: 1. The Romanian Orthodox Church wants to absorb the parishes in Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova that are subordinate to the Patriarchate of Moscow. 2. The absorption of parishes in Ukraine is a first step towards the capture, by Bucharest, of territories in Ukraine where ethnic Romanians live. 3. The government from Chisinau, with the involvement of Romania, will liquidate the Metropolitanate of Moldova, subordinate to Moscow. 4. Romania is an expansionist state. 5. Ukraine is an artificial state.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: Several Orthodox Churches operate in Ukraine, the largest of which, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, is subordinate to the Patriarchate of Moscow. After the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church announced that it was severing ties with the Patriarchate of Moscow because of the unequivocal support it and Patriarch Kirill (a former KGB agent) had shown for the war waged by Russia. Despite the rupture, the government in Kiev remained suspicious of the true intentions of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its relations with Moscow and started a series of investigations aimed at it, and as part of the investigation, several houses of cult, which led to accusations from the Church that she was being persecuted.
Against this background, tensions arose related to the churches that serve the Romanian community in Northern Bucovina, which belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Metropolitan Longhin of the Eparchy of Chernivtsi and Bucovina within the Ukrainian Orthodox Church was appointed to this position by Kirill himself and has stood out in the past through clear positions in favor of Moscow and virulent attacks against the Romanian Orthodox Church.
It should be noted that the politnavigator.ro article refers to a material from a website funded by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, spzh.news, which contains numerous critical materials against Kiev.
The Orthodox Church in the Republic of Moldova is divided into the Metropolitanate of Moldova, subordinate to the Russian Orthodox Church and which has the most places of worship and the largest share in society, and the Metropolitanate of Bessarabia, subordinated to the Romanian Orthodox Church.
The Metropolitanate of Moldavia appeared after the annexation of Bessarabia by the Tsarist Empire. On the other hand, the Metropolis of Bessarabia presents itself as the successor of the entity with the same name created after the union of Bessarabia with Romania, in 1918. Eliminated during the former USSR, it was reconstituted in 1992, but was officially recognized by the Chisinau authorities only in 2002, after attacking the Republic of Moldova at the ECHR.
The Metropolitanate of Moldova is considered affiliated with Moscow, and its priests and leaders have openly or indirectly supported certain pro-Russian political parties or politicians, usually from the left. The most scandalous was the involvement of several church representatives in the electoral campaign for the 2016 presidential elections, against Maia Sandu. Then the Constitutional Court asked the Parliament to prohibit the involvement of the Church in the electoral campaigns.
And the relationship between the two Metropolies has been hostile over the years, accusing each other of pressure and attracting priests and churches from one to the other.
Most polls show that the Church remains the institution that enjoys the most trust from the citizens.
Politnavigator quotes Antena 3 and Romania TV, the latter being also quoted by spzh.news. Both channels have been criticized in the past for spreading fake news and misinformation (for example, during the Romanian protests against OuG 13 or during the Covid pandemic). Antena 3, a channel that even added CNN to its name in order to gain more credibility, managed to fall into ridicule by presenting images from a computer game as scenes from the war in Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: To discredit Ukraine as a state that persecutes religion and Romania as an expansionist country. To promote the thesis of the artificial nature of Ukraine. To cause panic in the society of the Republic of Moldova that the government will close the churches or hand them over to the Romanian Orthodox Church. To fuel the narratives related to the ""danger of the union"" of the Republic of Moldova with Romania.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Romania recognizes Ukraine within its current borders and has no territorial claims on the neighboring country, even if a number of territories that belonged to it are currently in Ukraine as a result of the territorial abduction committed by the USSR following the signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop treaty with Nazi Germany. Also, Romania has no territorial claims on the Republic of Moldova, being, moreover, the first state to recognize its independence and a constant supporter of it, including regarding Chisinau's efforts regarding European integration.
On the other hand, Romania is a secular state in which the Church is separated from the state, so that the actions of the latter have no connection with the Romanian state. Anyway, BOR does not have an expansionist policy and even if it had one, it cannot legally take over the parishes of other Orthodox Churches.
Even the title of the article on politnavigator, ""The Sandu Regime will liquidate the Metropolitanate of Moldova and hand over the churches to the Romanians"" is misleading, as it does not refer to the information in the text. Only statements from an official meeting of Patriarch Daniel with the President of the Parliament from Chisinau are presented. Igor Grosu, who does not support the statement. The two discussed the fact that the Metropolis of Bessarabia would be discriminated against. ""The Patriarch of Romania requested equal treatment for the Metropolis of Bessarabia, so as to allow its clerics to provide religious assistance in the army, penitentiaries and hospitals , as well as to be invited to the official events to which the clerics from the other church structure on the territory of the Republic of Moldova are invited"", the BOR press release states.
According to the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, ""Religious cults are free and are organized according to their own statutes, under the conditions of the law"". The supreme law of the Republic of Moldova also provides: ""Religious cults are autonomous, separate from the state and enjoy its support, including by facilitating religious assistance in the army, in hospitals, in penitentiaries, in asylums and in orphanages"". Accordingly, the head of the BOR requested the support of the Chisinau authorities to ensure the rights provided for in the Constitution to the Metropolis of Bessarabia.
The statement that Patriarch Daniel came to Chisinau to demand the return of the assets of the Romanian Church is false. He was never, at least in his current position, in the Republic of Moldova. It is true that he had such discussions last week with the President of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, Igor Grosu, who was on a visit to Romania.
There is no evidence that there is any pressure, filings or files on the priests in the order. And the one who makes the statement - Gheorghe Cavcaliuc, is a former police colonel, leader of an opposition party, who fled to Great Britain in 2021, criminal files being opened on his name.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: As it appears from the press release, Patriarch Daniel referred to the discrimination of the Metropolis of Bessarabia and requested the retrocession of several buildings, but he did not refer to churches. Publication / Media:

Iuri Lutenko, who was also one of the leaders of the opposition during the pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych's time, would thus morally prepare the Ukrainians for defeat.

NEWS: ""Lutenko prepares the Ukrainians for defeat in the war and promises them a harsh February. The former Prosecutor General of Ukraine Iuri Lutenko wrote on January 20 on social networks that Ukrainians must prepare for hard times.
[...] ""It will be a difficult month. We have to get used to the fact that the situation will be of such a nature that we will not only have news about victories,"" he wrote. The former Prosecutor General explained the withdrawal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from a number of localities by the need to preserve the lives of the soldiers .
[...] In Russia everything takes place according to plan - organized, quiet, without panic and noise. The intensity of the offensive increased"".
NARRATIVE: The former Prosecutor General of Ukraine morally prepares the Ukrainians for a defeat in the war
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, in his post on Facebook, Iuri Lutenko, who was the Prosecutor General of Ukraine during the time of President Petro Poroshenko, after previously being imprisoned by the pro-Russian Yanukovych regime, did not write that Ukraine they must prepare for defeat. On the contrary, he encouraged the Ukrainians to resist despite the heavy fighting in Donbass. The Russian government media built this anti-Ukrainian propaganda narrative starting from an anti-Russian post!
""We chase away the mercenaries of the Wagner group like kitchen cockroaches, we kill them not only with the help of artillery, but also with kamikaze drones. Soledar is a real trap,"" Lutenko writes, denigrating Russia's fighting methods.
At the same time, the politician, who fights in a territorial defense unit, writes that Russia is sending more and more soldiers on the offensive and has numerical superiority, and the Ukrainians must have a lot of patience because ""the war does not consist only of victorious reports of the spokesmen of power"".
The Russian press does not remember anything about these theses of Lutenko, ignoring the final message in the post: ""We will resist. We will organize a great counter-offensive. We will liberate our territory. We will win this war.""
Therefore, Iuri Lutenko did not morally prepare the Ukrainians for a defeat in the war, but on the contrary, he tried to encourage them in the face of a Russian offensive. A series of Russian publications published this fake news, adding that ""by April, Russia will defeat Ukraine on the battlefield"". The purpose of this narrative is to destroy the morale of the Ukrainians and to deepen the war fatigue, which has reached a new level. phase in the context of the bombing of the Ukrainian electrical system by Russia.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news about the war in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, NATO supplies Ukraine only with obsolete weapons, and the EU hides its involvement in the crimes committed by establishing a special court. The Russian press wrote that the Russophobic foreigners will have the right to tear apart Crimea and Donbass after the liberation of these territories. In July 2022, Russian journalists demonstrated that American scientists support Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. Various fake news were also released about the Government in Kiev, which expressed its distrust in its partners from the West, or about the terrorists trained in the EU, who will act against civilians in Donbass.

In reality, Ukraine needs weapons from the West to defend itself against Russian aggression in the context of continued hostilities.
NEWS: ""The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, wants to involve all the states of the world in a global nuclear war,"" said the French politician, former MEP Florian Philippot.
""Zelenski asks the states of the West to increase the quantities of supplied weapons. He wants a world nuclear war! Let's get rid of this mindless puppet quickly,"" he wrote on Twitter.
[...]
Starting from February 24, Moscow is carrying out a special military operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine. Vladimir Putin announced that the purpose of the operation is to ""defend the people who for eight years were subjected to terror and genocide by the Kiev regime"". The armed forces aim to liberate the Donbass and guarantee Russia's security.
NARRATIVE: Volodymyr Zelenski's goal is to draw humanity into a world nuclear war.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian press presents a post on Twitter by the politician Florian Philippot as the opinion of the entire French society, writing that in France, ""Zelenski's great plan of aggression was discovered"". Florian Philippot is a supporter and follower of the ideas of the president of the National Front Marine Le Pen, known as a partner of the Putin regime in France. Philippot was vice-president of the National Front and coordinator of the candidate's electoral campaign, who represented the French extreme right in the elections.
In 2017, a few weeks after the defeat of the candidate Marine Le Pen in the presidential elections, Philippot founded a new political force, called ""Patriots"", which for a period of time had the status of an NGO, with the aim of promoting nationalist ideas in French society. and Le Pen, Florian Philippot has an anti-European, Russophile and ethnocentric position.
On October 30, 2022, he accused NATO of organizing diversions at the Russian gas pipeline ""Nord Stream"", claiming that he has information that Russia is not to blame. Florian Philippot is often quoted by the Moscow press to illustrate a series of false narratives about the nature of the war in Ukraine.
On December 27, 2022, he declared that Zelensky is not supported by the American Congress because during the Ukrainian leader's speech there were only 82 out of 213 Republicans in the room. The politician is quoted by the Russian government press on various occasions.
This time, Florian Philippot says that Zelenski is an aggressor who wants to launch a nuclear world war, without mentioning Moscow's decision to invade Ukraine on February 24, 2022 or the war crimes committed by Russia on the territory of a foreign state. Ukraine, which is defending itself against Russian aggression, is presented as an invader, and Kiev's legitimate requests for armed support are shown as a desire to start a world nuclear war.
Such narratives, also identified in the past, aim to sow fear in Western societies in order to block the supply of weapons to Kiev, the nuclear threat meanwhile becoming an element of this hybrid war. It should be noted that the scaremongering with the nuclear war was also officially resumed by the former Russian president, currently vice-president of the Russian Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, who said that if Russia loses the war in Ukraine, it could trigger a nuclear war. Medvedev also warned the defense ministers of the NATO countries to take this into account when discussing the supply of weapons to Ukraine.
Moscow and the politicians loyal to Russia in the EU are trying to convince the international community that the war in Ukraine will last a long time due to the supply of weapons to Kiev, otherwise it will end very quickly, but on the basis of Russia's conditions. Therefore, the Russian propaganda, quoting pro-Kremlin politicians, tries to make a narrative ring: the cause is replaced with the consequence. The victim is shown as the aggressor, and the invader as the party defending against the offensive.
In reality, Ukraine was willing to hold peace negotiations, but gave up the idea because of Russia's ultimate demands and its attacks on civilian targets. Volodymyr Zelensky proposed a peace plan, based on the norms of international law, categorically rejected by Russia. Under such conditions, with an adversary that rejects negotiations but only gives ultimatums, Ukraine is forced to defend itself, and to defend itself it needs armaments - but it only requested Western weapons, and its partners only provided defensive armaments.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, to push it to war against Russia, and because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, the Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated by Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion in 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

The false narrative was launched by journalist Ion Cristoiu. In reality, Cristoiu interprets facts and statements in his personal note, without providing any evidence to support his claims.
NEWS: ""This is the first stage of what is supposed to be the direct military involvement of many European countries in the form of a multinational coalition. The tanks and helicopters sent now are not for the Ukrainian military, outnumbered by the Russians, but for the multinational coalition military. We could say that the participating countries are already sending the heavy weapons that their own military will need when they start the War against Russia alongside Ukraine.

[...] Under this sign of dragging Romania into irresponsible adventures, only and only to get a post at NATO or the EU after the end of the mandate, Klaus Iohannis is working hard for Romania's participation in the multinational coalition.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The West will attack Russia, which is stronger every day. 2. Romania will enter the war, forced by the Western countries. 3. Romania's status within the EU and NATO will continue to be one of lower rank, as a vassal state of the West.
CONTEXT: Almost a year after the launch of the invasion in Ukraine, Russia failed to achieve any major operational objective, such as the conquest of Kiev or the entire Donbass. Moreover, it was not able to maintain the territorial gains in the Kharkiv region or the strategic city of Kherson. In addition, the serial bombings that targeted, for months in a row, the Ukrainian energy infrastructure, failed to generate significant operational effects or demoralize Ukrainian society, as the Kremlin probably hoped. Despite these aspects, the actions and statements from Moscow lead to the conclusion that the Russians are beginning to treat the ""special military operation"" as a long-term conflict and that they are preparing to carry out a decisive strategic action in the coming months, aimed at regaining the initiative on their side and to put an end to the series of military successes of Ukraine. In these conditions, Kiev asked the Western countries for more numerous and better-performing weapons. The context could not remain unutilized by the defenders of the ""Russian peace"" and a new fake news, structured on several levels, it was launched in the public space. It is not the first time that Ion Cristoiu promotes false narratives related to the war in Ukraine; for example, just a few days before the Russian invasion, Cristoiu said that the Western press misinforms about the crisis in that country, and after the invasion he issued theses that coincide with those of Russian propaganda, for example that Ukrainians are the cannon fodder of the West, that the war in Ukraine is a pretext for denigrating Russia, censorship, scaring the population in Romania and Europe and enriching arms sellers, etc.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the West, NATO and the European Union, inducing the fear of war and increasing the number of those who imperatively demand that Ukraine accept ""Russian peace"", promoting the sovereignist discourse and validating fake news of Moscow origin.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Ever since the beginning of the Russian aggression in Ukraine, Western leaders have clearly and bluntly stated that they will not engage in a direct war with Russia, but that they will support Ukraine's defense by other means, including the provision of weapons and military equipment. The statements of the Western leaders are found in the facts - in order not to provoke Russia, the Western countries were careful with the weapons they delivered to Ukraine. In the first stage of the war, the West offered only light equipment, and some more powerful equipment, such as the HIMARS systems, were delivered in limited quantities. Fighter planes, heavy tanks, long-range missiles were not delivered even after a year of war.
Until this moment, even if Russia is victimizing itself by posing as a state attacked by NATO and the European Union, the Kremlin has failed to provide evidence of real confrontations on the battlefield with regular troops of any NATO or EU member state. It should be noted that that battlefield is in Ukraine, a state invaded by Russia, and Kiev is the only one in a position, according to international law, to decide who it accepts or not on its territory.
Anyway, the Western states have not taken any action that would suggest a potential attack on the Russian troops in Ukraine. The hypothesis that the Western allies send their weapons to the war zone as a precaution has no logical foundation. No army determined to attack would leave its equipment in the hands of others, with the risk of being misused, damaged or even captured by the future enemy. The more and more efficient weaponry supplied to Kiev has no other purpose than to strengthen Ukrainian defensive capabilities.
Ion Cristoiu also manages the performance of contradicting himself, a custom already well-grounded among the promoters of Moscow propaganda, when he states that Romania was not accepted in Schengen in order to be able to be blackmailed with this ""privilege"" and force our country's participation in imagined military coalition (HEY Romania! Almost three months ago, the master showed us that the reason for rejecting our accession to Schengen was the supposed constanta-Rotterdam port rivalry. It is somewhat redundant to also mention that Austria, the reason why, in the end , we did not enter Schengen, it has a neutral military status, so it could not attract anyone to a military coalition; moreover, Austria has been considered, for years, one of the Western countries closest to Russia. As a last argument of the collapse of Mr. Cristoiu's argumentation, we quote part of the dialogue on YouTube, in which no one distinguishes good propaganda from bad, and the news about joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises becomes fake news promoted by the West to justify the military intervention in Ukraine :
,,Ionut ,,Sarmaluta"" Cristache: Good, we understand that the latest information talks about the fact that Russia and Belarus have started joint military exercises.
Ion Cristoiu: It is part of the propaganda.
I.S.C.: Propaganda whose (sic!) what purpose is it?
I.C.: What purpose?! Ukraine is at the edge of the precipice, jump it's killing me, we have to intervene, finally, militarily."" Publication / Media:

In reality, in the capital of Ukraine, a rally was held by the wives and mothers of the soldiers in captivity, who asked the president to carry out a new exchange of prisoners.
NEWS: ""In the center of Kiev on January 14, a mass protest action took place, called the ""Widows' March"", informs ""Ruskaia vesna"". The protest was attended by the wives, mothers, relatives and relatives of the Ukrainian soldiers who were included in the list of those who disappeared without a trace or were imprisoned. In reality, most of these soldiers died, but the management does not notify the relatives in order not to pay social pensions and various allowances.
It should be noted that the Ukrainian press did not mention anything about this sad event - an obvious thing in a totalitarian state"".
NARRATIVE: The mothers and wives of the Ukrainian soldiers killed in the battles protest against the war.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: The news is broadcast by a number of news agencies in Russia, sometimes with the title ""Ukraine widows' Maidan"" or ""Widows ask Zelensky uncomfortable questions"". The purpose of this narrative is to demonstrate to the public opinion in Russia that the Ukrainians are dissatisfied with a government that does not negotiate with Russia, while the number of soldiers killed is increasing. The Russian press writes that the ""totalitarian regime"" in Ukraine has forbidden journalists to write about the protest.
In reality, a rally of the mothers and wives of Ukrainian soldiers took place in Kiev, who requested the president Volodymyr Zelensky to negotiate a prisoner exchange formula, known as ""all for all"". According to the arguments of the participants in the rally, this formula it will allow the prisoners to return home in the shortest possible time.The event in Kiev was covered by national television stations, various newspapers and press agencies.
These mass actions became traditional in Ukraine during the war, taking place in the summer and autumn of 2022. In October, the wives and mothers of the fighters at the Azovstal plant demanded that all Russian prisoners be exchanged for Ukrainian ones. This is not a protest against the war or a request addressed to Zelensky to surrender to the invaders, but a reminder to Ukrainian society, the authorities and the West that there are many Ukrainians whose fate is unknown.
The Russian press used footage and photos from these rallies to illustrate their propaganda theses about the Ukrainian people dreaming of peace, while the politicians want to continue the war to enrich themselves. Also, the narrative is used to convince the public opinion in Russia that the soldiers sent to Ukraine are registering successes on the battlefield, as a result the number of widows is increasing in Ukrainian society.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote, for example, that Zelenski killed over 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army, and the EU states will ask Ukraine to surrender to Russia. At the same time, according to Russian propaganda, American scientists support all Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace, while Ukraine is mobilizing a million soldiers, paying with human beings for Western loans.

110,612,Chisinau's militaristic intentions cause concern in Bucharest,"the Republic of Moldova becomes a burden for Romania, which is worried about Chisinau's bellicose position.",False,[],['Bucharest'],,,,,,,https://www.ng.ru/dipkurer/2023-01-15/11_8634_status.html?fbclid=IwAR0sJb7iFBivQiUYGDMOROJUbnQIW27AbV_QbZahu0MTqRavVb0fJUyOPyY,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-intentiile-militariste-ale-chisinaului-provoaca-ingrijorari-la-bucuresti,,17.01.2023,,Moldova,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-intentiile-militariste-ale-chisinaului-provoaca-ingrijorari-la-bucuresti,,"""Romania is worried about the militaristic intentions of Moldova"" according to a narrative recently launched by Russian propaganda and picked up by media institutions from Chisinau. The author, a former communist deputy, slipped into the article several false theses, intended to cast doubt on the solidity of Chisinau-Bucharest relations. In reality, Romania remains the main supporter of the Republic of Moldova in the EU, but also a major commercial partner, and regardless of the political color of the government, it is the first country to support, in moments of crisis, the Republic of Moldova.
NEWS: It is considered that the Romanian politicians do not sleep at night and they are all thinking about the annexation of the Republic of Moldova, using the favorable international context and some (even if not very convincing) historical arguments. But it's not really like that.
Romanians are worried about the fact that the Moldovan authorities, who have failed in the management of economic and energy security issues, want to stay in power on the back of promoting Russophobia and exploiting the ""fraternal relations"" between Moldova and Romania.
This concern led the Romanian expert on Russia, Armand Gosu, in an article for Revista 22, to an unexpected conclusion: ""Romania would team up with Hungary, playing Russia's score"". Meanwhile, Moldovan officials started talking about the need to strengthen and equip the army and to review the status of neutrality, which would not be able to ensure the necessary security in the current conditions"" NARRATIVE: The Republic of Moldova is becoming a burden for Romania, which is worried about Chisinau's belligerent position.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova and Romania have built a special relationship in the last 30 years, even if they have also gone through periods of tension, especially when the Communist Party ruled in Chisinau. Both in Bucharest and in Chisinau there are politicians, representatives of the intelligentsia and a part of the citizens who opt for the reunification of the two states, a subject that has not been officially discussed. Romania was the first state to recognize the Independence of the Republic of Moldova, and is currently a supporter of its European integration.
However, the Russian and pro-Kremlin press in the Republic of Moldova, as well as pro-Russian politicians, present Romania as a revanchist state and the union as an ""imminent danger"". The narrative primarily targets the ethnic minorities, but also the so-called Moldovanists (many among them ex-Soviet nomenclators or close to them), who are scared of the ""Romanian gendarme"" and Western moral decay, also associated with the European integration of the Republic of Moldova.
The comment from ng.ru, written by a former communist deputy, seems to overturn the propaganda about the unification and arming of the Republic of Moldova by NATO and Romania, in order to prepare it to go to war against Russia, as well as a multitude of articles about Romania's intention to annex the Republic of Moldova and even a part of Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: The new narrative seems to be linked to a more important theme for Russian propaganda, namely the West's tiredness to help Ukraine. The objective is to present, in the present case, the government from Chisinau as an increasingly warlike one, which has lost control and is pushing the country into isolation. At the same time, a message is being sent to the Russian public that the ""enemies"" of Russia are losing their unity, are disunited, and Ukraine and the countries that support it (in the present case, the Republic of Moldova) are abandoned by their international partners.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: First of all, the Republic of Moldova and the government in Chisinau have never had a militaristic or pro-war attitude. Chisinau condemned the military intervention, and later started talking about the need to strengthen the country's defense capabilities, but no reference was made to renouncing the status of neutrality. Chisinau's message is that the Republic of Moldova needs a modern and well-equipped army, which does not mean renouncing the status of neutrality, as President Maia Sandu declared on public television at the end of December.
The Republic of Moldova and Romania have become even closer in the last year, as Bucharest helped Chisinau to manage the flow of Ukrainian refugees, delivered electricity to it last fall, after Russia reduced gas deliveries and destroyed the Ukrainian energy system, diplomatically supported the Republic of Moldova obtaining the status of a candidate country for EU accession, was among the organizers of an international platform through which the Republic of Moldova received foreign assistance assurances of approximately 1.4 billion euros.
""I wanted to come to Chisinau, at the end of the year, to convey a strong message of support for all the citizens of the Republic of Moldova. Romania stands by and is ready to offer all the necessary support and solutions to face the challenges,"" said the Romanian Foreign Minister, Bogdan Aurescu, during his visit to the Republic of Moldova at the end of December.
And the quote by the Romanian expert Armand Gosu that ""Romania would team up with Hungary, interpreting Russia's score"" is taken out of context. Armand Gosu was actually talking about Romania's relations with Ukraine and did not in any way refer to the Republic of Moldova or its relations with it. Publication / Media:

111,613,"The products from the European Union will contain flour from crickets, which is allergenic and leads to anaphylactic shock",Europeans will be forced to eat insects even if it kills them,False,[],['the European Union'],,,,,,,https://ortodoxinfo.ro/2023/01/09/atentie-la-produsele-din-ue-contin-faina-din-greieri-care-produce-alergii-si-duce-la-soc-anafilactic/,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-produsele-din-uniunea-europeana-vor-contine-faina-din-greieri-care-este-alergena-si-duce-la-soc-anafilactic,,16.01.2023,,Romania,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-produsele-din-uniunea-europeana-vor-contine-faina-din-greieri-care-este-alergena-si-duce-la-soc-anafilactic,,"The EU requires the use of cricket flour, which can even kill some consumers, according to a fake news that appeared in Romania. This resumes the false narrative that the EU will force its citizens to eat insects. In reality, Brussels only approved the entry of a new cricket flour producer on the EU market, but the use of its products is not mandatory. In the same way, the purchase of products containing ingredients based on insects remains a personal choice of consumers.
NEWS: ""The European Union has authorized the entry into the market of a new food product produced by Vietnam, which will be part of several EU food products. It is about the partially defatted powder of the house cricket, with the scientific name of Acheta domesticus. The flour will be used in the preparation of bread and multi-cereal buns, crispy biscuits and breadsticks, cereal bars, premixes for bakery products (dry), biscuits and pasta-based products (dry and filled). ""
NARRATIVES: 1. The ""food reset"", part of the New World Order program, will force us to eat insects. 2. The world occult aims to poison humanity and reduce the planet's population.
CONTEXT: In a 2013 study, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization states that insects can be an alternative source of protein, and insect farms are more environmentally friendly than those that raise animals. It didn't take long and there were voices claiming that the study and the intention of the European Commission to approve the sale of food based on insects in the community space, would be just a new stage in the evil plan of the world occult, to poison and reduce the population of the planet. The theory obviously did not bypass Romania, and was taken up and amplified by various public figures, from politicians and journalists to influencers skilled in everything. Thus, with each new regulation of the European Commission in the food field, the topic of ""food reset"" and New Age diets is taken up and aggressively disseminated on sovereignist-conservative propaganda channels, more or less under the influence of Moscow.
The commercialization of the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) as food was approved by the European Commission as early as February 10, 2022, following the approval, on November 12, 2021, of the commercialization of the traveling locust (Locusta migratoria) and, on February 8, 2022, of the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), all in frozen, dry and powdered form, but at that time the subject was not carefully treated by the sovereignist propaganda, occupied with the ""sanitary dictatorship"" and the justification of the Russian aggression in Ukraine. He came to the attention of the opinion public at the end of the summer of 2022, being discussed by the nationalist leader George Simion on the occasion of his wedding.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the population's trust in the European Union and promoting the sovereignist discourse.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The use of insects as an alternative source of protein is not new, and insects are regularly consumed in many parts of the world. A recent study made a synthesis and showed that in the world approximately 2,000 species of insects are consumed in over 100 countries! Edible insects, and especially crickets, are part of the traditional diet of several countries in Asia, such as China, Japan, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, but also in Equatorial Africa or even in Mexico. Their consumption takes place in different forms and on different occasions. Their preparation usually includes frying or steaming for consumption as a main course or snack. The home cricket is appreciated for its taste, aroma and texture. Also, the intake of nutrients, especially proteins, of these insects is considerable, a fact established by a series of studies and laboratory analyzes carried out over 20 years. They show that, for example, cricket flour contains proteins and essential amino acids in proportions between 50-70%, and the fat content reaches 20%. Crickets are also a source of minerals, such as copper, selenium, magnesium, zinc and vitamins. Without implying a diet based exclusively on insects and, in no case mandatory, increasing the weight of insects in the basic diet of mankind could help feed a continuously growing population.
Through the decision of January 3, 2023, the European Commission does nothing but approve the commercialization in the community of insect-based products by a Vietnamese producer, whose file was analyzed and confronted with the results of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) during for 4 years (2018 - 2022). Moreover, EFSA, in a scientific opinion published since 2015, stated that the use of insects as a source of food and feed has important environmental and economic benefits and does not raise major food safety hazards. Insect farms can lead to lower emissions of greenhouse gases and ammonia than those of cattle or pigs and to a greater efficiency in the conversion of feed into proteins, the report also shows. At the same time, EFSA concluded that, as long as insects are fed with currently permitted feed, the chances of allergic reactions or toxic effects are similar to those of other currently used protein sources. The cricket, being an arthropod, has many proteins similar to those of other insects, house dust mites and crustaceans, as well as those of molluscs. That is why the European Commission imposed the rule of labeling food products containing partially defatted Acheta domesticus (house cricket) powder in an appropriate manner, in accordance with European regulations. The approval given by the European executive only concerns farmed crickets, not wild ones, the risks of toxic contamination being in this case similar to the cases of consumption of edible mushrooms from authorized breeders compared to those picked in the forest. In addition, contrary to general opinion, food products containing insect-based ingredients have been in the Romanian diet for some time, and cricket flour can even be found on websites that sell so-called traditional products or dedicated to athletes' nutrition.
In conclusion, the consumption of insects, regardless of the form and method of cooking, remains a choice, the European Commission underlining this as clearly as possible in an official response sent to the PressOne publication in August 2022: ""The European Commission will not force citizens to eat insects (or anything else). The consumption of insects is possible, never mandatory, as long as they are authorized as new foods by the Commission"". As an example, the Belgian supermarket operator Delhaize (Mega Image in Romania) introduced in 2014 a food based on mealworms in the stores in Belgium, but was not successful, having to quickly withdraw the product from the shelves.

In reality, she encouraged the aspiration towards energy independence of the Western states, stating that the EU risks going into recession due to Russian aggression, but also other factors.
NEWS: ""European states that want to become independent from Russia in the field of energy will face a hard winter this year,"" said the general director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, in an interview for CBS.
Georgieva mentioned that the situation in Ukraine ""hit the EU very hard"" and predicted that half of the member states will go into recession.
""We analyze Europe's reaction to the energy shock and notice that the states are moving towards independence from supplies from Russia. But a hard winter is coming, and the next one will be even harder,"" she said.
[...]
As Vladimir Putin stated, the policy of containing and weakening Russia is a long-term strategy of the US and its allies, but the sanctions have had a significant impact on the world economy. The main goal of the West is, according to the Russian president, to worsen the lives of millions of people"".
NARRATIVE: Because of Ukraine, the EU states will go into recession, and without Russian energy they will not last.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Russian government media is manipulating public opinion, selectively using quotes from an interview given by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva to CBS NEWS. The coordinator of the largest financial organization in the world did not blame Ukraine, predicting a recession in the EU states. She said that the economic problems were deepened by the Russian aggression on the Ukrainian state. The Moscow press omitted a series of important fragments from the interview, calling the war in Ukraine a ""situation"", ""crisis"", ""conflict"" or ""misunderstanding"". The impoverishment of European citizens is explained by the ""situation in Ukraine"", as if Russia is not to blame.
Moreover, the West is once again criticized for having unilaterally introduced sanctions against Russia, the purpose of which is to ""make life worse for millions of people"", and not to stop the military invasion of Ukraine, as it is in reality The EU has explained more than once that it imposed a series of new sanctions against Russia in response to the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 and the illegal annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine. These are added the measures imposed on Russia since 2014 as a result of the annexation of Crimea and the non-implementation of the Minsk agreements. The purpose of the sanctions is to economically weaken the aggressor in order to pacify him, in accordance with the norms of international law.
Kristalina Georgieva's statements regarding the problems the EU will face during the winter were also taken out of context. According to the Russian media, the head of the IMF understands that the attempt of Western states to be energy independent from Russia will create problems for them, because the winters will be harder. In reality, Georgieva declared: ""True, it will be a hard winter, it is possible that next winter will be even harder, but we are getting closer to freedom from being dependent on Russia."" Therefore, the words of the IMF director general were not a scarecrow for the EU, as the Russian press wrote, but as an encouragement. Besides, the reality also contradicts the Russian theses regarding the energy crisis - at least for now, thanks to the mild winters, the European gas deposits are almost full, and the amount of energy obtained from other sources has increased significantly.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news from the Russian media regarding the impact of the war in Ukraine on the West. According to Russian propaganda, the Germans are disappointed by the EU's decision to financially support Ukraine, and the French categorically reject the policy of sanctions against Russia and the assistance given to Kiev. In July 2022, Russian propaganda ""proves"" that American scientists support Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. The Russian press also wrote that foreign diplomats are withdrawing from Kiev for fear of a Russian offensive. Various fake news about the Government in Kiev were also launched , who expressed his distrust in the partners from the West, or about the terrorists trained in the EU, who will act against civilians in Donbass.

The ""Matrix in Ilfov"" conspiracy, the episode ""Pizza to take away""
twitter.com @cobratate; forbes.com/31 Dec. 2021; theguardian.com/1 Jan. 2023; reuters.com/dec 30 2022; digi24.ro 29 Dec. 2022
 ""Matrix has sent its agents"" - was the first message sent by the British Andrew Tate after at the end of last year he was picked up together with his brother Tristan from the luxurious house in Voluntari - Ilfov by the police investigating organized crime.
The cryptic wording posted on Twitter by the former kickboxing fighter, self-declared promoter of misogyny, suggests that he is the victim of an occult conspiracy. A few weeks before, the person suspected of human trafficking and rape appeared in the podcast of the American entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, where he pleaded for the investment in Bitcoin with the explanation that ""he does not trust the Romanian government"" and that cryptocurrency is ""the only conclusion"" logic"" to avoid asset confiscation. On the other hand, Andrew Tate's reference to the ubiquitous Matrix, following his arrest, caused the TikTok and Twitter platforms to be stormed by conspiracy posts, while the number of his followers increased in two days from 3,300,000 to over four million on Twitter alone. A leap comparable to that of last November, when, after taking over the platform, Elon Musk ordered the reopening of Tate's account, blocked in 2017 for disparaging statements about women, which increased the number of followers of the British influencer by one million in 24 hours.
Most of Andrew Tate's supporters declared themselves convinced either that his arrest was dictated by occult forces, or that everything is a stage and that the accusations against their idol are unfounded. Many users argued that, in reality, the millionaire suspected, among other things, of pimping, would have been released immediately after being detained, without being charged. As the alleged proof, the posts presented sequences from a news broadcast on December 29 by the Romanian channel Digi 24, in which the Tate brothers appear leaving the DIICOT headquarters relaxed, without handcuffs. In reality, the respective images - undated - were from the archive, having been filmed in April last year. Not only the invocation of the theory of simulated reality, taken from the sci-fi production ""Matrix"", contributed to the huge surplus of popularity registered after the arrest of Andrew Tate's Twitter account.
A day before, an online controversy with the environmental activist Greta Thunberg started from the carbon emissions of Tate's 33 luxury cars culminated with the British posting a clip in which he derides the environmental concerns of the Swede , provocatively displaying a pizza box that he promises not to recycle. Many users hastened to draw the conclusion that the display of the box with the legible name of the supplying restaurant contributed to Tate's location by the Romanian police. A ridiculous speculation, the presence of the British in Romania being well-known even to the judicial authorities, who were investigating him since April last year.
No matter how childish, the interpretation gave Greta Thunberg the chance to have the last word - ironically - in a dispute that, by the way, brought the 19-year-old 1.3 million new followers on Twitter, bringing her closer to six million: ""This is how you suffer if you don't recycle pizza boxes!"".

In reality, the Ukrainian army has modern Western weapons with with whose help he managed to liberate a number of districts in the south-east and north-east of the country.
NEWS: ""NATO states, led by the USA, supply the Ukrainian armed forces with outdated military equipment to fill their own warehouses with the latest weapons,"" writes Jacek Tochman, columnist at Niezalezny Dziennik Polityczny.
""Military aid from the West reaches Ukraine permanently. Most of the weapons are in a bad technical condition. The military equipment has many problems, being scrap metal and garbage, which is confirmed by the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"" the article says.
Experts from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) also confirm that most of the weapons come to Ukraine from old military stockpiles. All this is done to fill the empty warehouses of the EU and the US with new weapons, the newspaper writes.
""Cleaning the warehouses of such weapons is beneficial for the West. First of all, the modernization of the own arsenal takes place. And while the EU and the United States clean out their warehouses, the Armed Forces of Ukraine must use what they are given,"" the article says.
NARRATIVE: NATO supplies Ukraine only with obsolete weapons.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, thanks to the supply of modern weaponry by the West, Kiev managed to liberate a number of localities. The technological difference was immediately felt on the battlefield. In 2022, the Ukrainian press analyzed the quantity and quality of the weaponry offered by the West to Ukraine, reaching the conclusion that the Ukrainian army is totally dependent on the military support of its partners. Compared to the reserves of the Ukrainian army exhausted in April-May 2022, the weapons in the West are much more modern.
In fact, the dismantling of this news is done by the Russian press itself, which wrote in the fall of 2022 in other articles that the USA sent the most modern weapons to Ukraine, some of them being tested on the battlefield. A few months later, this narrative was abandoned. In November 2022, the Russian press wrote that the Ukrainian army has had the most modern weapons since 2014, so that it ""starts a war with Russia"". Therefore, Russia's propaganda theses contradict each other.
The military adviser in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Serhiy Kuzan, said that Ukraine received a lot of modern weapons, and some types of equipment are being tested for the first time on the battlefield in Ukraine. The expert confirmed that without the military support from the West, Ukraine would not have resisted.
The Russian press built this false narrative by citing a virtually unknown Polish website. The initial news was written by a journalist who cannot be found on social networks and is not listed as an author in other publications. Most of the articles are taken over and have an anti-Western character. On the page of the article quoted by the Moscow press we find comments like: ""Russian propaganda on the territory of Poland, shame"". The Russian press adds that the International Institute for Peace Research in Stockholm (SIPRI) shows that most of the weapons come to Ukraine from military reserves of the West, which is not proof that the weapons are obsolete. The warehouses are emptied after the weapons are supplied, then they are filled again.
This news is a continuation of a false narrative, launched before the invasion of Ukraine, according to which the military equipment received by Ukraine from Great Britain and the United States is outdated or expired. In January 2022, the Russian press wrote that the NLAW and Javelin systems were sent to Ukraine because London no longer needs them. The operational period of these missiles expires, and sending these weapons to Ukraine is rather a method of getting rid of them, according to Russian propaganda. Military events from February-March 2022 showed that thanks to this weaponry the Ukrainian army managed to defend its capital, drive out the invaders from the city of Kharkiv, Javelin and NLAW becoming a scarecrow for Russian tanks and armored cars.
Veridica also debunked other fake news about the nature of Western support for Ukraine. According to the pro-Kremlin media, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. The Russian government press wrote that the Government in Kiev expressed its mistrust in its partners from the West, adding that terrorists are being trained on EU territory who will act against civilians in Donbass. Propaganda tried to convince public opinion that the West is asking Kiev to give in to Moscow, while Ukrainian refugees are housed in former Nazi concentration camps. Publication / Media:

In reality, Brussels has never spoken in favor of union, considering the Republic of Moldova an independent state, to which it has offered the status of a candidate country for accession.
NEWS: ""In 2022, the authorities of Moldova have completely stopped defending its national interests on the international arena. Maia Sandu's team is doing everything in its power so that the republic loses its independence and is swallowed up by Romania. The attempt to change the Moldovan language, the vote against the resolution against the heroism of Nazism, joining the anti-Russian sanctions - this is how the ""pro-Europeans"" wanted to please the West.
The declaration of Moldova's independence more than 30 years ago was considered as the rebirth of the statehood of the Moldavian voivodeship, once quite influential in the region. Poland, Hungary and even Turkey took him into account, even if for a long time the local voivodes were vassals of the Turkish sultan and paid beer.
[...]
Since Maia Sandu came to the most important position in the state, the legislation and infrastructure are unified with those of Romania in rapid steps, preparing for the renunciation of national sovereignty and the entry into the Romanian component.
This is manifested through various projects for connecting gas pipelines and power lines, connecting different villages to the aqueduct network and even training the soldiers of the Moldovan army.
In addition, the governing bodies of the EU declare themselves ready to accept the union project and not prevent the swallowing of Moldova"".
NARRATIVES: 1. The West supports the annexation of the Republic of Moldova to Romania, with the agreement of the pro-European government in Chisinau. 2. The Republic of Moldova is the legal successor of the medieval Moldavia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The imminent union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania (the annexation of the Republic of Moldova) is one of the main theses of the Russian propaganda and the pro-Moscow politicians from Chisinau, being associated with the old Soviet narrative about the ""Romanian gendarme"" (who mistreated, torture, made fun of the local population), launched shortly after the union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918.
The same narrative often comes together with one launched in Chisinau in the last two decades that the Republic of Moldova is, in fact, the legal successor of medieval Moldova, associated in turn with theses regarding the existence of a Moldavian language and people.
The Moldovan language would even be the predecessor of Romanian, or, as the former communist president from Chisinau, Vladimir Voronin, said, ""it is the mother of the Romanian language"".
OBJECTIVE: To promote theses related to the ""danger of annexation"" of the Republic of Moldova to Romania, which especially scares members of ethnic minorities and nostalgics. To present the government in Chisinau as an anti-statist one, controlled from outside (Bucharest, the West).
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The current territory of the Republic of Moldova was always a component part of the medieval Moldavia without ever having any special legal status as part of it. In 1812, following a controversial peace treaty between the Tarist and Ottoman Empires, the latter ceded Bessarabia. After the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, Bessarabia proclaimed its independence, and a few months later, on March 27, 1918, the State Council (legislative body) voted with a large majority for the union with Romania. In 1940, the Soviet Union reoccupied the territory, following an ultimatum sent to Bucharest, and created the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic to which Transnistria joined, but from which the southern counties, which had been part of Bessarabia, were separated. The SSR became independent in 1991. Therefore, with the exception of a few months during the First World War, there was no independent state structure on the territory of the current republic; moreover, the territory of that first state structure between the Prut and Dniester only partially coincides with that of the Republic of Moldova. The Principality of Moldavia continued to exist even after the Tsarist Empire annexed Bessarabia and disappeared in 1859, once it chose to unite with the other Romanian principality, and Romania is the legal successor of both principalities.
Although there is discussion in certain circles both in Chisinau and in Bucharest, about a potential union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania, this topic was never officially discussed between the leaders of the political classes in the two states; in addition, Romania was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Moldova.
The projects of interconnection of the energy infrastructure of the Republic of Moldova and Romania were launched more than 10 years ago in order to reduce the dependence of Chisinau on Russian energy resources, but also to bring Moldova closer to the European space, European integration being an assumed country project successive governments. The Iasi-Ungheni gas pipeline, for example, was officially inaugurated in 2014, even if it was not fully functional for many more years due to various reasons invoked by Chisinau or Bucharest. The attention on them increased in 2022, in the context of the energy crisis on the entire European continent.
European officials have never thought about a possible union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania. The Republic of Moldova is considered in Brussels to be a sovereign and independent country, which in June 2022 obtained the status of a candidate state for accession. The European Union is among the main international institutions that provide financial support to the Republic of Moldova, and Romania is among the leaders of the donor states.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: For over three decades there have been discussions, in certain circles, regarding a possible union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania, but never at an official level. Publication / Media:

In reality, the Ukrainian leader spoke about the projects to restore Ukraine to which some foreign companies should be invited. There is no question of ""Russophobia"" or ""tear apart"", as Russian propaganda claims.
NEWS: ""Zelenski promised to allow Russophobic foreigners to tear Crimea and Donbass apart. After the liberation of Crimea and Donbass, it will be absolutely right for the foreign companies that during the special military operation entered the Ukrainian market or left the Russian market to participate in the reconstruction works as a matter of priority, mentioned the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy during his speech before the Verkhovna Rada regarding the foundations of Ukrainian foreign and domestic policy [...]
We need to find a format that will allow these companies to benefit from more opportunities in such projects of rebuilding the new Ukraine: Ukrainian, American, French, Polish businesses, as well as others that are with us now,"" said Zelenskiy.
NARRATIVE: Russophobic foreigners will have the right to tear Crimea and Donbass apart after the liberation of these territories.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The propaganda narrative is based on the intentional misrepresentation of Zelensky's message to the Verkhovna Rada. In his speech, the president of Ukraine spoke about the project to restore Ukraine after the continuous bombings by Russia, drawing attention to the need to encourage companies that were in solidarity with the Ukrainian state, leaving the Russian market, or those that did not leave the Ukrainian state despite the war. Dismantling this news can be done based on the video clip posted on the same page of the Russian publication. Politnavigator inserts in the article a fragment of Zelenski's speech that does not coincide with the propaganda narrative, but the video material was titled ""Zelenski promised to allow Russophobic foreigners to tear apart Crimea and Donbass"". However, we do not find anywhere in this video material such a promise.
In fact, Russian propaganda resorted to a classic method of distorting the truth in this case as well. The headline of the news has nothing to do with Zelenski's message, and the introduction to the article incorrectly quotes Zelenski twice.
In reality, Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke about the restoration of Ukraine, including Donbass and Crimea, and not about ""dismemberment"". Zelenskiy did not mention the ""special military operation"" anywhere, but spoke about war, aggression, invasion, Russian terrorism to. After this wrong quote with unnatural additions, the Russian press publishes the correct speech of Zelensky in Ukrainian, without translating it, in which we do not find any information about Russophobic foreign companies, about a special military operation or about tearing up some territories.
The purpose of this narrative is to deepen the distance between Kiev and the inhabitants of the occupied territories by presenting the projects to restore the Ukrainian regions based on Western financing as initiatives of division, directed against the Russian speakers.
The false narrative fits into the meta-narrative about Ukraine and the West organizing a genocide against Russian-speakers in Crimea and Donbass, and Zelensky's idea to encourage foreign businesses that have not left the Ukrainian state despite the war is presented, without any evidence, as a danger for Russian speakers.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that were aimed at proving to the public opinion in the east and south of the country that Ukraine hates them and aims to massacre them. The Russian press also wrote that only Russian speakers from the east are being mobilized in Ukraine because they want to exterminate them. Another news item was published, according to which, due to Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion in November 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West during 2022.

The narrative, as well as others, relates to climate denialism and conspiracy theories according to which global warming is an invention intended to justify the establishment of the so-called ecodictatorship.
NEWS: Oxford wants to be the first city in Europe to massively restrict people's freedom of movement. You are only allowed to move where you can walk in 15 minutes. For anything else, we will need authorization from the city administration. Everything is monitored with barriers and cameras.""
NARRATIVE: In the future, people will be forbidden to leave their place of residence, cities will be turned into prisons and labor camps.
CONTEXT: The Covid19 pandemic and Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine have represented two topics that have overshadowed the struggle that humanity will have to wage with global warming and its catastrophic climatic consequences in the last three years. As Veridica anticipated a year ago, the subject has returned to the attention of public opinion, and the fighters against the ""sanitary dictatorship"" are regrouping on the front of climate denialism. Activenews.ro, the well-known website promoting conspiracy theories and fake news, makes a summary prophetic of the measures that will be taken by the leaders of the world and that will ultimately lead to the enslavement of the population.
OBJECTIVE: Inciting civil disobedience and social revolt against the authorities for electoral purposes, reducing and even stopping actions that affect economic interests and businesses from polluting activities.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the local authorities in Oxford will implement, from January 1, 2024, the concept of the ""15-minute city"", already present in large metropolises such as Paris, Barcelona, ​​Buenos Aires or Melbourne.
This residential urban concept provides that most daily needs (supply of food and medicine, visits to the family doctor, going to school, etc.) can be fulfilled either by walking or by bicycle, in very short times. The concept experienced intense popularization in the 2020 electoral campaign of the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, and claims that everyone who lives in a city should have access to essential urban services 15 minutes from home.
One of the main objectives of the implementation of this concept aims to reduce car traffic and, implicitly, reduce the pollution caused by them. In no case does it target the free movement of people, who are encouraged to use public transport, bicycles or walking. The benefits of this lifestyle start from having more free time at your disposal to those related to physical and mental health, cleaner air, quality green space and stronger ties with the community. For example, an area adapted to this concept becomes a much more favorable environment for the development of small local businesses that the sovereignists urge us to support. Referring to the concrete case of Oxford, the installation of road barriers between six areas of the city has the purpose of minimizing the access and transit of cars through the city center, not of people. To cross the city with a personal car, those who want to will have to pay a rather high fee or choose a detour route, consuming time and fuel, exiting the city belt and then re-entering the destination area. People will still be able to move freely, the only constraint being that of doing it in a sustainable way, without polluting even more the area where they live.
NUTS OF TRUTH: Several cities around the world are looking for solutions to implement the ""15-minute city"" concept to reduce pollution and combat climate change caused by global warming more effectively. Publication / Media:

In reality, the EU did not commit any crime on the territory of Ukraine, but supported Kiev's defensive efforts in the face of Russian aggression.
NEWS: The European Union is trying to hide its involvement in war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, initiating the creation of a special court, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Serghei Versinin, told RIA Novosti.
Moscow, according to the diplomat, is not surprised by the discussions of the anti-Russian delegations at the UN, including the EU states regarding the creation of an ""international tribunal"" against Russia.
""These Russophobic states are willing to violate the UN Charter, especially the articles that prohibit involvement in the internal affairs of the states of the world. The EU, which participates in providing funding of billions of dollars for the supply of armaments to Ukraine, is trying to hide its own involvement in the commission of war crimes by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"" the diplomat said.
This ""absurd initiative"", emphasized Versinin, will have no legal consequences and will become ""a legal nonsense"". ""The creation of this tribunal, or more correctly, this pseudo-tribunal, without the participation of our state and its agreement, is legal nonsense, and its decisions, if they exist, will never be recognized"", he emphasized.
NARRATIVE: The EU hides its involvement in the crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine by establishing a special court.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: At the end of November, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the EU will establish a special court to try ""Russia's crimes in Ukraine"". ""Continuing to support the international criminal court, we propose the establishment of a specialized court, supported by the United Nations, to investigate and judge the crimes committed by Russia through aggression,"" Von der Leyen said. For now, there is no definitive decision to create such a court; discussions are still taking place at the EU level.
The EU's idea of ​​a tribunal for crimes in Ukraine does not violate the UN Charter. Beyond the fact that such a tribunal would be supported by the UN member states to help the International Criminal Court during investigations, the UN Charter does not prohibit the establishment of tribunals. In the case of collaboration with UN bodies, the decisions of these tribunals produce international legal effects. On the other hand, military aggression against a sovereign state is prohibited and severely condemned. Such an aggression was launched by Russia in 2014 and went to the stage of a large-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. Russia is bombing Ukrainian towns, and has destroyed numerous civilian targets, including housing blocks, schools, power plants, etc. The crimes are documented by journalists and independent investigators. Some evidence (satellite images, drone footage) unequivocally attests that the Russian military committed war crimes in the Kiev, Kherson or Kharkiv region. Ukraine asked the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send investigators as soon as possible to gather evidence of war crimes. The victims in Ukraine are caused by the Russian invasion, not by the decision of the Ukrainian leadership to organize a state defense and request the help of the EU states.
Kiev is supported by a number of EU states that want to help the Ukrainian investigators. For example, after the international community found out about the massacre in Bucea, the French government made the decision to provide international judicial and police assistance for the detection and collection of evidence of the war crimes committed in Ukraine by Russia, and the Russian press immediately distributed a propaganda narrative about the French gendarmes who will hide the traces of the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea.
The MFA in Moscow, through the Russian government media and various Telegram channels, distributed - without presenting any evidence - a false narrative about the involvement of the EU in committing these crimes, but not directly, but through the Armed Forces of Ukraine, supported from the West.
Moreover, in order to exculpate Russia, the pro-Kremlin press also wrote that the Ukrainian military are neo-Nazis and commit war crimes against civilians in the east and south of Ukraine with the help of weapons received from Western countries.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that were launched with the aim of exonerating Russia and blaming Ukraine or the West for committing war crimes. In April, the Russian press wrote that American experts believe that the news about the atrocities of the Russian military in Ukraine are an invention of Ukrainian propaganda. The propaganda narrative was also dismantled, according to which the UN admitted that the Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for military purposes, and Zelenski announces the organization of a new genocide of Russian speakers in Kharkiv and Donbass.

In fact, the Republic of Moldova later obtained the status of a candidate country without having to legalize marriages between people of the same sex.

One of the conditions imposed on the Government and Parliament in Chisinau is to allow LGBT marriages, although EU legislation does not oblige member states to allow or recognize same-sex partnerships or marriages.

NARRATIVE: The EU conditions the accession of the Republic of Moldova on the legalization of LGBT marriages
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHO: With a fairly conservative society, in which the Church enjoys the greatest credibility and in which a large number of citizens are oriented towards Eurasian integration, the LGBT topic is quite sensitive in the Republic of Moldova.
This has been used for political purposes for at least 10 years, as happened in the case of the protests against the equal opportunities law in 2012. The fact that the leader of the pro-European forces, Maia Sandu, is not married was used in the campaign for the presidential elections in 2016, and a rumor that he was gay was promoted by the power media during the 2019 parliamentary elections.
Topics related to the LGBT community have been used for years by Russian propaganda (or by ultraconservatives influenced by it or with similar ideas) in its attempts to discredit the European Union. Thus, the EU is presented as ""Gayropa"", a space in antithesis to that of traditional, Christian values, which Russia would represent; a false equivalence is drawn between homosexuality and pedophilia in order to convince the public that the legalization of pedophilia is sought; the idea of ​​an ""LGBT agenda"" that the EU would try to impose is induced; finally, an attempt is made to identify human rights, which represent a fundamental value of the European community, with the promotion and encouragement of non-traditional sexual relations.
OBJECTIVE: To associate the European integration of the Republic of Moldova with sensitive subjects and decisions that have the support of a narrow part of the population (in the present case, the possible granting of additional rights to sexual minorities) in order to debunk and reduce the number of supporters of European integration. At the same time, to counterbalance Russia, where ""traditional values"" are protected (life.ru recalls that Vladimir Putin promulgated the law prohibiting LGBT propaganda).
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The annual report on the implementation of the EU-Republic of Moldova Association Agreement was approved by the European Parliament in May, but published in the EU Journal on December 16, which probably explains the launch of this media campaign Just now. The report contains a series of findings and recommendations regarding the Republic of Moldova, but it is not binding.
Moreover, the phrase related to allowing same-sex marriages is a recommendation, not an obligation or condition. ""Invites the Republic of Moldova to remove the constitutional ban on same-sex marriages established in 1994 and to establish anti-discrimination measures for LGBTI people"", according to the document. Therefore, the European Parliament does not oblige and does not condition the amendment of the Constitution to join the EU; moreover, accession is not even the subject of the report in which the recommendation appears. Moreover, the European Parliament adopted, at a later date, a resolution in which it explicitly asks the European Council to grant the Republic of Moldova the status of a candidate country for the European Union .
On June 23, the Republic of Moldova obtained this status, that is, it deepened its relations with the community bloc, without offering additional rights to sexual minorities. In addition, none of the 9 conditions imposed by Brussels for advancing on the European path refer to this subject.
This fact is also confirmed by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration from Chisinau, Daniel Voda, who commented for Radio Moldova the news about the alleged conditioning as ""an ordinary fake, spread to manipulate public opinion"".
The West/EU do not have a pro-LGBT agenda but pro-respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, including sexual minorities.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The annual report on the implementation of the EU-Republic of Moldova Association Agreement ""invites the Republic of Moldova to eliminate the constitutional ban on same-sex marriages established in 1994 and to establish measures to combat discrimination for LGBTI people"" .
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: ""This is an ordinary fake, spread to manipulate public opinion. This document does not express the list of conditions for the accession of the Republic of Moldova to the European Union. I remind you that there are the nine recommendations of the European Commission and they are public, including on the MAEIE website, and can be found in the action plan approved by the National Commission for European Integration"", the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration from Chisinau, Daniel Voda.

In reality, the woman is without right in - an area under a protection order, thus violating a decision of the local council.
NEWS: ""In Great Britain, a woman was arrested on suspicion of praying ... in thought. She is sent to court and risks up to two years in prison, because she confessed that she prayed (I repeat, in my mind), and that near a clinic where abortions were performed, a place where, apparently, it is forbidden to pray , whether and (or maybe especially, who knows?) in thought.""
NARRATIVE: The New World Order aims to destroy Christianity, the last bastion of resistance against satanic domination.
CONTEXT: Conspiracy theories amplified by disinformation campaigns launched primarily by Russia try to validate the idea that there are various occult conspiracies to subjugate humanity and distance it from Christianity. Narratives along these lines can be found in conspiracy theories like PizzaGate and QAnon, in the Russian propaganda discourse regarding Gayropa, in the fierce opposition to biological passports (or to vaccination certificates and QR codes during the Covid-19 pandemic), in the news false statements regarding the banning of Christmas by the EU, in the populist speeches that plead for the ""traditional family"". Almost any event, no matter how insignificant, can be linked to the ""persecution of Christians"" through ambiguous and allusive formulations or omissions of information. Theories of this kind could obviously not bypass Romania, a still deeply religious and conservative country with inclinations towards extremism since the last century. The last three years have represented a real festival of fake news, many with Moscow origins, adapted to local ethos by opinion leaders of ultra-conservative extremist circles. The ultra-religious discourse in Romania goes hand in hand with the pro-Putinist one: Archbishop Teodosie does not consider that the Russian president is doing anything wrong, and Senator Diana Sosoaca, a declared anti-vaccinist, pleaded in the middle of the pandemic for the Russian anti-covid19 vaccine, Sputnik, and was convinced that in Ukraine no there is no war.
OBJECTIVE: Arguing the false theory that the Christian religion is the favorite target of the world occult, increasing the confidence of followers that we are in the midst of a ""holy war"", inciting hatred and social disobedience.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Ever since 2014, British local authorities have received powers, based on the Antisocial Behavior, Crime and Police Act, to introduce public space protection orders, the so-called PSPOs (Public Space Protection Orders). These are meant to solve more effectively the unpleasantness or problems that damage the quality of life of a community. A PSPO is intended to ensure that people can use and enjoy public spaces, living safely from anti-social behaviour, and may impose conditions and restrictions on people using the specified area. The incident referred to in the news in question took place in such a space, delimited by a PSPO established around an abortion clinic, to ensure unfettered access to both clients and clinic employees, without fear of confrontations, provocations or aggression . Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, the arrested woman, is a well-known British anti-abortion activist, leader of the March for Life UK organization. Prior to the day of her arrest, she had violated the respective order, signaled by a clear display, three more times and was invited to the police station to give statements. The arrest took place after the woman's refusal to accompany the police crew voluntarily, the standard procedure for police bodies around the world. Later released, she was accused of violating the special protection order and will be tried by a local court. The fact that, during the dialogue with the present policeman, she states that ""it is possible that she prayed in thought"" has absolutely nothing to do with her arrest, just as there is no ""thought crime"" in British law.

121,623,"Zelenski killed over 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army","zelenski killed over 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army",False,[],"['Zelenski', '50 thousand']",,,,,,,https://www.mriya.news/32918-zelenskii-unictozil-50-tys-zenshhin,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-zelenski-a-ucis-peste-50-de-mii-de-femei-mobilizandu-le-in-armata,,26.12.2022,,Russia,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-zelenski-a-ucis-peste-50-de-mii-de-femei-mobilizandu-le-in-armata,,"Out of 57 thousand enlisted women, about 6 thousand remained on the front, the others being killed or taken prisoner, writes the Russian press, accusing President Volodymyr Zelensky of killing his own people in the Russian-Ukrainian war. In reality, according to the data of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, only 101 women were killed in the war, and many of those enlisted did not reach the front, but are part of the auxiliary structures of the army located in different regions of the country.
NEWS: ""Zelenski killed 50 thousand women. The Western press tried to make a nice report about the women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine [...] In the article we find an important nuance: 57 thousand women were mobilized or voluntarily registered in the armed forces. At the moment there are about 6 thousand left! Where have more than 50 thousand disappeared?!
The answer is obvious: they died, were wounded or were taken prisoner"".
NARRATIVE: Zelenski killed more than 50 thousand women, mobilizing them in the army.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: The articles in the Russian media about tens of thousands of women killed in the war because of President Volodymyr Zelensky, who does not make concessions to Russia, are based on a post on the Telegram channel of the pro-Russian former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mikola Azarov, who fled to Russia in 2014. Starting from a report produced by AP News, dedicated to women in the Ukrainian army, Azarov makes an intentionally wrong mathematical calculation, saying that if there are only 6 thousand women left on the front, it means that the others, over 50 thousand, were killed, and Zelenski is to blame, who ""doesn't stop the war"".
In reality, according to the official data and explanations of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksii Reznikov, there are about 59 thousand women in the Ukrainian army, but only 5-6 thousand are in the front area. Only 38 thousand women are military personnel, the others being civilians who help the army far from the front.
Reznikov's data, in fact, coincide with those of Russian propaganda, but the Ukrainian minister explains that most women are not in the front area, they are not in the trenches, but they help the Ukrainian defense in various auxiliary structures or territorial defense units. It is about military doctors, communication specialists, accountants and others who are mobilized in the army. If there are only 6 thousand women on the front, this does not mean that the rest were killed by Russia. It is a miscalculation presented to public opinion to demoralize Ukrainian society.
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine announced at a congress of Ukrainian women that in the war 101 women were killed, 100 were wounded, and 50 are missing without a trace. Not to mention the 50 thousand women killed in this war.
The figure of 50 thousand women killed in the war is also exaggerated in the context of Kiev's protest against an EU statement, which was later corrected, about 100,000 soldiers and approximately 20,000 Ukrainian civilians killed since the beginning of the war.
The false narrative regarding the losses reappears from time to time on Telegram channels and news portals in Russia and the occupied territories to sow panic, discourage Ukrainian resistance and block Kiev's defensive efforts. In fact, both sides try to present small figures of their losses. In any case, it cannot be about hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers killed and tens of thousands of women, as the Russian government press writes. At such a level of losses, to which the wounded would be added, the Ukrainian army would no longer exist at this moment and effective counter-offensive actions were not possible.
Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives aimed at discouraging Ukrainian resistance in the war. The Russian press wrote, for example, that the EU states will ask Ukraine to yield to Russia, and American scientists support all Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace, while Ukraine is mobilizing a million soldiers, paying with human beings for Western loans.

In reality, Ukraine has the right to recover this territory and the international community has never recognized the illegal annexation of Crimea or its belonging to Russia.
NEWS: ""The right to carry out military operations in Crimea was offered as a gift to the Armed Forces of Ukraine by the USA and is seen in the peninsula as a declaration of war against Russia. The permanent representative of Crimea next to the presidential administration of Russia, the vice-prime minister of the Republic of Crimea, Gheorghi Muradov, mentioned the perfidy of the American scheme to wage war with our country: ""They are trained to wage war with the bloody foreign hands of the Nazis [.. .] We cannot avoid reminding Washington about our nuclear capabilities that can rise above the dumb heads of the madmen in the American capital,"" Muradov said.
The politician emphasized that [any violation of Russian sovereignty in Crimea] is equivalent to an invitation to ""bomb Washington"" [...]
Admiral John Kirby hastened by the permission offered to the Ukrainian army to bomb Crimea, because Crimea (however much the American political elite would like to think otherwise) is a territory of Russia both de jure and de facto"".
NARRATIVE: The US declared war on Russia, allowing the Ukrainian army to bomb Crimea.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: According to Russian propaganda, Crimea is a territory of Russia, so military operations in this territory would represent an aggression against Moscow to which it can respond by attacking the aggressor state. On the other hand, Russian propaganda constantly tried to involve the West (NATO, the United States) as responsible for its part of the conflict in Ukraine. Initially, an alleged NATO threat was among the pretexts invoked to trigger the war; later, against the backdrop of the defeats suffered by the Russian army in the field, Russian propaganda - which cannot admit that Moscow's army is inferior to the Ukrainian one - began to convey more and more often the thesis that, in fact, the war in Ukraine is a war with the West .
In reality, Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014, a fact condemned by the international community. According to international law, the peninsula is Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by Moscow. Kiev has every right to recover this territory by military or diplomatic means. The military operation to liberate Crimea is no different from the counter-offensive in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk or Kherson regions. Therefore, the bombing of some objectives in Crimea cannot be compared in any way with an act of aggression directed against Russia. Instead, the mere presence of Russian forces in the occupied Crimea represents an act of aggression against another state.
After the international press wrote about the Pentagon's decision to condition the supply of armaments to Ukraine by not using them in Crimea or on Russian territory, Admiral John Kirby stated that the US does not encourage Ukraine to bomb Russian territory, but admitted that Kiev has every right to recover the territories annexed by Russia, including Crimea.
Ukraine's Western partners have repeatedly emphasized that the Ukrainian army has every right to use the weapons offered on its sovereign territory. The Ukrainian army makes decisions independently of the West, so it is not coordinated by the USA, Great Britain or other states.
The USA and NATO are not parties involved in the conflict, supporting, at the same time, Kiev with weapons and humanitarian aid. From the beginning of the war until now, the United States and NATO have really tried to take all possible measures to ensure that they will not become part of the military conflict.
That is why Russia's bombing of an American city in response to Ukrainian operations is an act of aggression, not a response to an attack.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives regarding Russia's ""historic right"" over Crimea and the nature of the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia, and because neo-Nazi propaganda of Kiev, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated by Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion in 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself from a NATO aggression, being forced to save Donbass- the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

It also writes that Poland, in turn, seeks to annex part of the western regions of Ukraine. The false narratives start from theses, spread for years by Russia, regarding the artificial nature of the Ukrainian state and the aggressiveness of the West.
NEWS: ""Romania is preparing to occupy the Republic of Moldova and part of Ukraine, including Odessa and the Odessa region. The process is followed by NATO with the support of the USA, France and the Netherlands, writes the war correspondent Kotenok on his Telegram channel.
Bucharest has long been building plans for the revival of ""Greater Romania"", but it does not have enough forces to achieve this ambitious goal. But it is being helped by NATO, which has supplied forces and military equipment. It is the Light Infantry Unit of the US Army, ,, Screaming Eagles"", as well as military aid from France.
""Romania wants to expand its territory by adding Bucovina, a part of the Odessa region, including the city and to completely swallow Moldova"", says the war correspondent.
The West has plans to divide Ukraine and they will be carried out. Poland dreams of ""returning"" Lviv and part of the western regions of Ukraine. Even Hungary would not be against annexing a region. Under these conditions, Bucharest does not want to stand aside and will try to break a slice of cake"", writes topwar.ru
""The journalist assumed that the annexation will begin with a series of political, military and economic actions that will create chaos in the territory controlled by Kiev"", adds pravda.ru
NARRATIVES: 1. The neighboring states in the West of Ukraine will use the war to divide it. 2. Romania, with renewed visions, will annex, with the support of NATO, the Republic of Moldova and a part of Ukraine. 3. Ukraine is an artificial state.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The annexation by Romania, NATO, the involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the war have become among the main ""threats"" thrown into the public space by means of the Russian and pro-Russian media from Chisinau.
Romania is presented in the Russian press, but also by some of the politicians and mass media institutions from the Republic of Moldova as a revanchist, with territorial claims over the Republic of Moldova and some regions in the south-east of Ukraine. All these territories were part of Romania, which lost them as a result of the Molotov - Ribbentrop pact.
The theses are used to reanimate the phobias towards Romania, promoted even in the interwar period, especially among the national minorities, but also to present the Russian Federation as a force that could defend it from ""Romanian encroachment"".
On the other hand, Russian propaganda writes about a so-called intention of Poland to return to its historical borders at the beginning of the war.
OBJECTIVE: To present Romania, Poland (the West) as resold states, ready to satisfy their territorial claims at the expense of their weaker neighbors. Indirectly, to present Russia as the main salvation in the face of these claims. At the same time, it aims to promote an older thesis, launched by Russia before the launch of the large-scale invasion on February 24, according to which Ukraine is an artificial state, which will be dismantled even by its allies today. This thesis should also justify the capture and annexation of some Ukrainian territories by the Kremlin.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: NATO leaders have repeatedly stated that they are ready to defend the member states, including Romania, in case of attacks from Russia, but they have specified that they do not intend to attack Russia directly.
Romania was the first state to recognize the independence of the Republic of Moldova and, despite the fact that most of its territory is, from a historical point of view, part of the Romanian space, it has never made any territorial claims. Regarding the 101st Airborne Division, it aims to fortify, together with other units sent by NATO member states, the Eastern flank of the Alliance in the context of Russia's war with Ukraine and has no war missions. Moreover, NATO has been strengthening its eastern flank for years, in response to Russia's repeated aggressions in the region.
Romania has no territorial claims against Ukraine either, and this is clearly stipulated in the 1997 Treaty on good-neighborly relations, the signing of which was seen, at the time, as a necessary step for Romania to be able to integrate into NATO.
Of all Ukraine's neighbors, Poland was the most vocal and active in combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. Warsaw demonstrated through actions that it is a real supporter of Ukraine: it condemned the Russian aggression, supported the Ukrainian army, facilitated the institutional approach of Kiev to the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. According to www.statista.com, until October, Poland was the third largest donor of military assistance to Ukraine, after the USA and Great Britain, much richer countries with a much larger military arsenal.
Regarding the so-called artificiality of Ukraine, promoted by propaganda and some Russian ultranationalists, Ukraine is a member state of the UN, internationally recognized, whose borders (including Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014 and the 4 regions of south and east, annexed in 2022), independence and sovereignty were confirmed including by Moscow through the Budapest Memorandum of 1994.
NUTS OF TRUTH: In Romania there are voices that speak for the union with the Republic of Moldova and invoke the ""historical truth"" regarding territories that are part of Ukraine. Officially, Bucharest has not made territorial claims against any of Romania's neighbors. Publication / Media:

How to see the European winter on Russian television
arte.tv / Nov. 23 2022
A recent edition of the show ""Fake news"", made for the French-German cultural channel ARTE by the Russian journalists of Dozhd (Rain) television, in exile in Riga, humorously describes the Kremlin's propaganda regarding the piercing cold that they would have to- The Europeans endured it on the eve of winter because of the sanctions imposed on Russia.
Alexei Juravliov, Russian deputy and president of the Rodina (Fatherland) Party, invited to the program ""Direct Transmission"" on the Rossia 1 station: ""This (Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany - n.n.) is a scumbag! The Germans have already decided that they will to stay in 17o or maybe 15o all winter, it doesn't matter. The Czechs said they will put on fire whatever it takes to keep them warm. We will start burning Ukraine and everything that is left of it...""
Olga Scabeieva, Rossia 1 moderator: ,, Let's warm up too...""
Alexei Juravliov: ,,Exactly. The point is that they accuse us. It has no name. You can start the (gas pipeline) Nord Stream 2, open the valves from tomorrow and everything will be fine. Oh, no! It's the fault of the Russians! We're dying of cold but we don't open the tap!""
It's not just the moderators of the Kremlin's television stations who deride the energy crisis. Vladimir Putin himself used an expression from a Russian fairy tale, similar to our story ""The bear tricked by the fox"", to wish the Europeans a long winter.
Vladimir Putin, president of the Russian Federation: <<Just like in the Middle Ages, people started gathering wood for the winter. We can only say one thing, as in the famous Russian story: ""The wolf's tail will freeze"".>>
Disinformation goes further than Putin's arrogant irony. Several pro-Russian publications announced in an apocalyptic tone that Berliners cut down almost all the trees in the parks to keep warm, citing the American agency Bloomberg as the source. In reality, the cited article is an analysis of the current energy crisis, which also talks about the growing demand for firewood. In context, it is mentioned as a historical reference - and not as current information - the cutting of trees in the famous Tiergarten park by the locals to warm themselves immediately after the disaster caused by the Second World War. Trying to be as convincing as possible, Russian propaganda only succeeds in becoming embarrassing. In a live intervention on the channel Rossia 1, a Russian journalist resident in Germany, who claims to expose Western disinformation on her blog, appeared dressed in winter clothes even though she was speaking from her home in Munich. Asked by the presenter to explain her outfit, the apparently disheveled journalist complained, to the satisfaction of the interlocutors in Moscow, that in the apartments in Munich the gas heating does not work during the night. A disingenuous and embarrassing explanation at the same time, given that on the day in mid-October when the interview was conducted, the temperature in the Bavarian city was 18o C.
Vladimir Putin - the world liar of 2022
politifact.com / Dec. 13 2022
Vladimir Putin was designated the ""liar of the year"" by the analysts of the politifact.com website, specialized in dismantling fakes. The choice of the president of the Russian Federation from the multitude of authors of fakes propagated in the public space took into account the scope and tragic consequences of the disinformation promoted systematically used by Kremlin leaders and loyalist propagandists to justify the attack on Ukraine and deny the atrocities that followed. hundreds of thousands of dead - military and civilians, including hundreds of children -, millions of refugees, destroyed families and a global chaos on the energy market. The brutal attack was initiated and justified with gross mystifications: Putin's repeated denial of the existence of the state Ukrainian - although Russia recognized its independence in 1991 -, the unfounded accusations of genocide brought to Ukraine and the ridiculous pretext of denazification.
Since the first days of the war, Russian propaganda has resorted to grotesque explanations in the face of overwhelming evidence of violence against civilians. From the alleged joy with which the invaders were greeted by the so-called ""liberated"" population, to the embarrassing justification of the bombing of the maternity hospital in Mariupol presented as a military objective and, later, to the fanciful theory of the staging by the Ukrainians of the images with hundreds of corpses on the streets of Bucea - nothing proved the defiant indecency of Putin's disinformers. Neither the testimonies of the survivors, nor the evidence brought by international humanitarian organizations or journalists, nor the evidence of the mass graves left behind by the Russian army mattered.
In the year we are closing, Politifact counted hundreds of fakes distributed from Moscow's government accounts, a huge propaganda machine joined by media channels controlled by the Kremlin. As a complementary internal measure, Putin's regime censored the foreign press and the Russians' access to the Facebook and Twitter platforms. In addition, the government has legislated prison sentences for citizens who distribute inappropriate information. Just these few brief examples are enough for the Politifact website to award the Kremlin leader the detestable but well-deserved title of champion of lies in 2022.
World Cup 2022 - online disinformation competition
observers.france24.com / Dec. 13 2022
Barely finished, the World Football Championship in Qatar has left behind, in addition to the joys or disappointments of the supporters, numerous misinformation aimed at the teams, microbists or organizers. Here are three of them, dismantled by the producers of the show ""Observatorii"" on the France 24 channel. The first example concerns the Japanese national team, accused on social networks of having left the dressing room in a deplorable state after the lost match with Costa Rica. The disparaging message, which rightly angered the Japanese, it turned out to be untrue. The photos of the ravaged locker room are from March this year were taken in the locker room of the Italian team, after the failure with North Macedonia that led to the elimination of the Azzura Squad from the World Cup qualifications. The fake is with all the more rudely as the Japanese players are recognized and appreciated for leaving the dressing rooms they use impeccably clean. In fact, the same concern for cleanliness and order was shown by the Japanese fans in the stands of the stadiums in Qatar. The second example is that of a video showing a collective Muslim prayer filmed - claims the author of the post on TikTok - at a stadium in Doha.
The images, which have gathered more than 850,000 likes and 40,000 redistributions, were actually filmed in 2019 at a stadium in Kazan, Russia, during the Ramadan fast and have nothing to do with football, let alone the World Cup , where the collective prayers took place outside the stadiums. A final example is a photo in which a group of supporters in the colors of the French team displays a placard on which the name of the country is misspelled. The post insinuates that, since they do not know how to write the name of their own country correctly, they are a group of fake supporters, from the category of those who - according to several reports - would have been paid by the Qatari organizers to liven up the atmosphere and fill the stadiums. In reality, a competent analysis proved that the photo was digitally altered by replacing two of the original letters. Using the reverse search method on the Internet, the original photo was also identified, which represents, indeed, a group of genuine supporters of France from India.

In reality, Kissinger detailed a diplomatic scenario imagined by him in the spring of this year, through which he offered a solution to obtain peace following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
NEWS: ""It is not very clear why Kissinger chose this moment to resume his position from the end of May, a position shared by us and former minister Andrei Marga, namely that Ukraine must get used to it faster with the idea that he is going to give up the current territories if he wants peace with Russia. Most likely Kissinger is trying to put his solution on the negotiating table unseen by the general public."" NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine's borders are unnatural, they must be reconfigured, and Ukrainian territory divided between the rightful ""owners"". 2. The rest of Ukraine must remain a buffer zone between Russia and NATO. 3. Ukraine does not want peace, as a result it is guilty for the war it is waging against Russia.
CONTEXT: In May of this year, Henry Kissinger asked all the forces involved in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict to urgently find a solution for peace. Kissinger suggests, however, that this solution can only be found by starting the negotiations from the status quo ante of Ukraine's borders, without detailing which status he refers to; it was speculated that Henry Kissinger would have suggested that Russia be given the Crimean peninsula, which it had invaded and annexed a short time ago. The speculation was treated as a certainty of Russian propaganda and was obviously taken up by the spokesmen of the Kremlin in Romania, among them the ex-turner at the Securitate, Andrei Marga. Kissinger came back with clarifications related to his suggestion, in an editorial published in the British press last week. On this occasion, activenews.ro, the well-known Romanian online source of fake news, returns with the Russian interpretation of the model suggested by Kissinger, trying at the same time to validate Andrei Marga's position, a position vehemently rejected and considered totally unacceptable by to Romanian diplomacy.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the idea that the war in Ukraine is nothing more than a plot between Kiev and NATO directed against Russia, portrayed as a victim who has the right to defend herself and protect her people, just as other countries should do Ukraine ""kidnapped"" them from their territories. Accreditation of the idea that the territories occupied and annexed by Russia belong, by right, to it, something that is also understood in the West.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Drawing a parallel with the outbreak and development of the First World War, Henry Kissinger warns of the danger of starting a global war, in the event of an escalation of the current Russian-Ukrainian conflict. But, although Kissinger briefly reviews the territorial reconfiguration of Europe after the ""Great War"", it is not considered an option at the moment. More precisely, the American diplomat does not see the cessation of the conflict by signing a treaty like the one in 1919, from Versailles. Aware that, at this moment, a neutral Ukraine, a buffer between NATO and Russia, represents a utopia, the former secretary of state suggests a provisional ceasefire agreement: Ukraine has become an important state for the first time in modern history in Central Europe. Aided by its allies and inspired by its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine has successfully opposed Russian conventional forces that have held Europe in check since World War II. This fact brings into question the issues of Ukraine's membership in NATO. Ukraine has acquired one of the largest and most effective land armies in Europe, equipped by America and its allies. A peace process should bind Ukraine to NATO, regardless of the chosen form. The alternative of neutrality no longer makes sense, especially after Finland and Sweden will join NATO. That is why, in May, I recommended the establishment of a cease-fire line along the existing borders where the war began on February 24. Russia would cancel its conquests there, except for the territory it occupied almost a decade ago, including Crimea. That territory could be the subject of a negotiation after a ceasefire.
Basically, Kissinger suggests an immediate stop to the Russian attacks on Ukraine and the withdrawal of Moscow's troops from the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. For Donbass and Crimea, captured by Russia or its people from Donetsk prior to the 2022 invasion, Kissinger proposes the organization of referendums on real self-determination and monitored by the international community - but only if their fate cannot be decided through negotiations. In no way does the American diplomat discuss the division of Ukraine as in Marga's vision, nor does he propose any voluntary transfer of territories from the Ukrainian side in favor of Moscow.
Both Ukraine and the West have consistently expressed their openness to negotiations, including for a change in the administrative regime of the two regions, but only under the conditions of the withdrawal of the invading troops from their territory. However, Russia's refusal and repeated attacks on the entire Ukrainian territory make these negotiations impossible. Publication / Media:

In reality, Kiev stopped exports on October 11, after the first phase of missile attacks, and the Republic of Moldova is supported in this crisis by Romania.
NEWS: ""The Kiev regime supplies the Republic of Moldova with electricity, while the Ukrainians are without electricity. Vladimir Rogov, the head of the ""Together with Russia"" civic movement, told about the hypocrisy of Ukraine, according to TASS.
The Russian politician declared that Kiev continues to supply Chisinau with electricity despite the sufferings that Ukrainians go through during periods of prolonged interruptions. Rogov believes that Volodimir Zelenski also has a percentage of the electricity supply in the Republic of Moldova.
We remind you that on December 5, the Russian military launched a series of missiles against Ukraine. According to unconfirmed information, 7 infrastructure objects were affected"".
NARRATIVE: While Ukrainians sit in the cold and darkness, Kiev sells electricity to the Republic of Moldova
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukraine has stopped supplying electricity to other states since October 11. According to the government of Ukraine, energy exports are not only impossible, but also dangerous for the national electrical grid. Kiev is trying to restore its energy system damaged by Russian missiles, and the interruptions have become more frequent in the context of efforts to stabilize the situation.
 In fact, not Ukraine, but Romania supports the Republic of Moldova in this energy crisis. According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bogdan Aurescu, there were times when Romania provided the Republic of Moldova with more than 90% of the necessary electricity consumption. In the meantime, the energy crisis in the Republic of Moldova has eased as a result of an agreement by which the Transnistrian separatist region resumed electricity deliveries to the territory on the right side of the Dniester, in exchange for increasing the amount of Russian gas that reaches, via Moldova, on the left side of the Dniester.
Independent experts consider that Russia's actions are a true energy terrorism. At the beginning, in October, Russia bombed the substations and transformers that ensured the connection between the national and local systems, i.e. the distribution system. There were blackouts, then planned outages.
On December 8, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that Russia is bombing the Ukrainian energy infrastructure.
The Russian press tries to put false accents in this narrative, ignoring the fact that the Ukrainians are suffering as a result of attacks launched by Russia, and not as a result of alleged electricity supplies to neighboring states. Russia's guilt is bracketed, ignored, minimized, anti-Ukrainian narratives being built on the basis of crimes committed by the Kremlin. In other words, Russia is trying to convince the Ukrainians that they suffer not from the launch of hundreds of missiles against civilian targets, but from the authorities that sell electricity to neighboring states!
Vladimir Rogov, a representative of the Russian authorities in the occupied area of ​​the Zaporizhia region, is quoted by the Russian press. He fled to Russia in 2014, after speaking out against Euromaidan, he supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass, and in 2022 he was brought by Russia as a representative of Moscow in the Zaporozhye region. He was prosecuted for collaborating with Russia. In this news, Rogov was presented as ""a Russian politician"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding Russia's energy terrorism launched against Ukraine. At the end of November, the Russian press wrote that Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government. Russian propaganda tried to prove that the massacre at Izium was a staging intended to compromise the Russian army. In June, the pro-Kremlin press wrote that the Ukrainian army is massacring Russian speakers during the withdrawal from Donbass, and in July - that Volodymyr Zelenski will be tried for war crimes in Ukraine.

NARRATIVE: Germans are disappointed by the EU's decision to financially support Ukraine.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The news, which also appears under the headlines ""Germans outraged by the EU's decision to send 18 billion euros to Ukraine"" or ""Why did we connect with them? Germans have lost hope in the EU regarding with Ukraine"" presents some comments from the German newspaper Die Welt as the opinion of the entire society. In reality, in the pages of the German newspaper we find a lot of pro-Ukrainian and anti-Hungarian comments. The Russian press selected 4-5 comments favorable to the Kremlin (possibly even written by trolls paid by Moscow), ignoring the other over 500 opinions, many of them very balanced. At the same time, taking into account all the comments of the newspaper readers does not mean a real survey of the German public opinion. There are some comments translated into Russian that do not justify the headlines that appeared in the press about ""revolted Germans"" and ""citizens disappointed by the EU"".
The Russian press presents Hungary's position as one directed against the Ukrainian state, which would have no right to benefit from EU financial aid. In reality, Budapest linked these negotiations to an older dispute regarding the freezing of EU funds for Hungary. In fact, this is also mentioned in the pages of the German newspaper Die Welt, being omitted by the Russian government press.
In reality, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban refused to give his consent for the financial aid granted to Ukraine in case the recovery plan and the cohesion funds provided for his country were blocked by the EU. Budapest had refused to accept a minimum tax of 15% for large multinational corporations.
On December 13 a.c. the Czech presidency of the EU Council announced that a compromise had been reached for the unblocking of EU funds for Hungary, also solving the problem of granting an assistance of 18 billion euros to Ukraine in 2023. Germany was among the supporters of this financial assistance. A poll from the summer of this year shows that 66% of Germans consider Russia to be the main responsible for the war in Ukraine, and 57% are in favor of breaking all economic ties with Russia.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine and the attitude of international organizations. Russian propaganda claims that Ukrainian politicians will go to war to make money and do not care about the suffering of the people. According to the pro-Kremlin media, the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. Also, the Russian press wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. According to the false narratives of the Kremlin, Russia shows restraint in the war in Ukraine, especially when it attacks civilian targets and aims to defend all Russian speakers from the genocide committed by Ukrainians.

""Ukrainians from Qatar"" and other Russian fairy tales with Nazis
dw.com / Dec 3 2022
For Russian propaganda, the easiest method of demonizing Ukraine remains the maintenance by any means of the image of a country dominated by Nazism. Deutsche Welle analyzed some of the alleged evidence of alleged nazification recently distributed on social networks. The first example is that of a video attributed to the Al Jazeera television station posted on Twitter and Facebook in several languages, including by Romanian users, with the explanation that it presents the case of Ukrainian supporters detained by the police at the World Cup in Qatar for using and spreading symbols Nazis. Among those who took over the images was the influential Russian journalist and propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, who gathered over 400,000 views on his Telegram channel. Made in the manner of Al Jazeera reports, the clip tells about three drunken Ukrainians who allegedly drew a Hitler mustache on a graffiti with the competition's mascot, adding a Nazi slogan. The same clip, with the specific Al Jazeera logo and graphics, also claims that the Ukrainians destroyed more than ten posters near the Al Bayt stadium in Doha and that they were arrested without resisting. The German journalists were intrigued by the absence from the images of the three mentioned Ukrainian microbists, all the more so since, due to the war, men between 18 and 60 years old are prohibited from leaving Ukraine - a country which, by the way, does not even qualified for the World Cup. Another inadvertence noted in the clip is the wrong spelling of the name of the stadium, an inexplicable error for an Arabic-language television based in Qatar. In fact, Al Jazeera categorically denied that it had anything to do with the distributed footage. An official confirmation of the hoax came from the Ministry of Interior in Qatar, which specified that the uniforms of the alleged policemen who allegedly made the arrests differed from those of the law enforcement forces assigned to the World Cup. Moreover, an online research revealed that the insignia on the uniforms of the so-called policemen are actually military insignia, although the country that uses them has not been identified. Another so-called proof of Ukrainian neo-Nazism analyzed by Deutsche Welle is the photo of a group of apparently Ukrainian soldiers with the German expression ""Jedem das Seine"" / ""To each his due"" written on their helmets - the slogan that welcomed the Jewish prisoners at the entrance gate to the Buchenwald extermination camp. Posted on the propaganda Telegram channel in German ""Neues aus Russland"" / ""News from Russia"", the image was obviously faked by digitally overlaying the compromising text on the original photo. It was identified as representing the Ukrainian band Antitila, whose members volunteered to fight the Russian invaders. The group became internationally known after recording a remix with the British musician Ed Sheeran in April, and the Washington Post used the photo to illustrate the event. A third case analyzed by German journalists is that of a video shot in a Ukrainian mall in which a swastika made of LEDs appears on the escalators. Widely distributed as recent evidence of the nazification of Ukraine, the images are authentic but old and taken out of context. As the mall administrators immediately stated, the incident - which lasted a few minutes - happened on February 16, 2019, when a 17-year-old hacker accessed the IT system of the shopping center by taking advantage of the visible password and using the TeamViewer software. The act was investigated and officially confirmed by Ukrainian prosecutors in July of the same year. Moreover, the press of the time covered the subject extensively and several independent sources verified and published similar conclusions.
The theory of attacking Russia from Romania is gaining popularity on Facebook
factual.ro / Dec. 6 2022; youtube.com/@RomanianPresidency / Nov. 28 2022; mediafax.ro / Oct. 24 2022
A post on Facebook on the eve of National Day with a ""quote"" attributed to President Klaus Iohannis induces the idea that NATO would launch an attack against Russia from Romanian territory. The fake, identified by factual.ro journalists, is a combination between a fragment of President Iohannis' statement at the beginning of the NATO summit in Bucharest and a hypothesis launched by journalist Ion Cristoiu in an editorial published by Mediafax. Without questioning the veracity of the so-called quote, many users reacted vehemently, some even insultingly , with comments that are part of the Kremlin's rhetoric regarding the alleged threat that NATO would represent to Russia. In reality, in the joint press statement with the Secretary General of the Alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, President Iohannis referred to the urgency of implementing the decisions taken in in the summer at the summit in Madrid regarding the eastern flank of the Alliance in the conditions of the threat represented by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The key words used in the allocation, as in the declaration adopted in Madrid, were ""defense"", ""deterrence"" and ""security"", in accordance with the objective assumed by the member countries. Instead, in the absence of arguments, the author the posts resort to a lie to accredit the pro-Kremlin disinformation adopted by Ion Cristoiu according to which the purpose of the armament and of the American and French troops deployed in Romania is to prepare a presumptive attack against Russia.
E.U. and Poland - ""tools of the devil"" in Ukraine
euvsdisinfo.eu / Dec. 8 2022
In the propaganda efforts to convince that, despite the unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, it is only a victim, Russia added, in addition to NATO, the European Union to the list of presumptive Western military threats against it. Publications that promote the Kremlin's disinformation, such as Sputnik, have described the launch of the European program of military assistance to Ukraine and the recent official inauguration of a training center in Poland as a hostile and unjustified form of militarization of the European Union that only fuels the conflict. Another thesis distributed on the Telegram channel suggests that the program is expensive for European taxpayers, which would prove that the so-called continental ""elite"" does not care about ordinary citizens, putting the interests of Ukraine above those of the Union. The euvsdisinfo portal I also note the inconsistency of the Russian disinformers who, after supporting the theory of Warsaw's territorial claims in western Ukraine, are now propagating the thesis of a concerted action by the Polish special forces together with the Ukrainian ones under the command of NATO. In parallel, the propagandists enslaved by the Kremlin lead to the heights of absurdity the accusations of a mystical-religious nature so far: for Sputnik Belarus, the proximity to the West of the Kiev leadership and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church proves that Ukraine has become not only a pagan country, but an outright anti-Christian one.

In reality, the amount is too small to make significant purchases, and the Republic of Moldova remains with one of the least developed armies in the world and a defense budget of approximately 0.7% of GDP.
NEWS: ""Moldova is intensively prepared for possible military actions, according to the Telegram channel ""Smuglianka"". The budget of the Ministry of Defense will be increased by 50% next year and will reach 85 million euros. The financial means will be used for the procurement armaments and ammunition, technology, increasing the salaries of the military, and it is clear that the authorities are led from the outside in this process.
According to the Constitution, Moldova is a neutral country. It is not surrounded by hostile countries. The only threat that Chisinau sees is Transnistria, or, more precisely, the operative group of military forces deployed there. The militarization of Moldova takes place in the context in which the collective West could open a second front against Russia. It can happen in Georgia on the border with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. On the Dniester, the military conflict is possible between Moldova and Transnistria.
Romania persistently supplies Moldova with weapons and ammunition. Video images frequently appear on social networks as the US brings military equipment through Romania. Moldova is seen as a puppet state, which will be used as a training ground to distract Russia's attention. Similar trials took place in Georgia, which was heavily armed before the South Ossetian war. Then Ukraine. Now it's Moldova's turn""
NARRATIVES: The collective West (formula used by Russian propaganda) is preparing to go to war with Russia and will use third countries such as the Republic of Moldova and Georgia as ""cannon fodder"". 2. The governance in Chisinau is totally subordinated to the West.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is considered the most vulnerable country and the first possible target of Russia in case it wins the war in Ukraine.
In addition to a weak and underfunded army, the Republic of Moldova also faces a secessionist conflict - its eastern region, known as Transnistria, claims its independence, being supported by Russia, and a Russian military contingent is located on its territory, which guards a huge military warehouse from the Soviet era.
After the launch of Russia's military invasion in Ukraine, the Chisinau authorities announced their intention to increase security and defense capabilities, statements commented by propaganda as an intention to join NATO and/or a signal that the country is preparing to enter war on the side of Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: 1. To present Russia as a victim/target of the West, in order to justify the military invasion in Ukraine and present it as a defensive war. 2. To present the pro-European government in Chisinau as a puppet of the West and, respectively, a potential danger for Moscow, which would justify pressures/interventions or even a military attack on the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: According to a study published in June 2020 by the Public Policy Institute, the Republic of Moldova ranks fourth from the bottom of the ranking regarding the share of military expenditures in GDP (0.38%) and second from the end regarding budget expenditures (1.11%).
In the year 2022, the budget of the National Army of the Republic of Moldova was approximately 50 million euros (of which a good part for the payment of salaries). In 2023, the expenses for the ""National Defense"" sector will reach approximately 76 million euros and, respectively, around 0.7% of GDP. With the approximately 6,000 soldiers and a defense budget of approximately 30 million of a larger euro, it is unlikely that the West will bet on the Republic of Moldova in a possible war with Russia.
The state budget for 2023 provides for an increase in the salaries of all budget workers, not just the military.
THE NUTS OF TRUTH: The budget of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Moldova will be increased by approximately 2/3, or by 32 million euros, given that the government has announced its intention to strengthen its defense capabilities due to the uncertainty related to security after the Russian invasion in Ukraine.

130,632,"The sanctions do not affect Russia, but they will cause a severe economic crisis in the West",the sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation actually affect the European Union and its population,False,[],['Russia'],,,,,,,https://www.activenews.ro/opinii/Secta-Nebuna-Liderii-occidentali-au-pus-la-cale-o-Sinucidere-ritualica-in-Masa-178102,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-sanctiunile-nu-afecteaza-rusia-dar-vor-cauza-o-criza-economica-severa-in-occident,,13.12.2022,,Romania,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-sanctiunile-nu-afecteaza-rusia-dar-vor-cauza-o-criza-economica-severa-in-occident,,"The economic sanctions imposed on Moscow, including the oil price ceiling, do not affect the Russian economy but cause an economic crisis of major proportions in the West, according to a false narrative spread in Romania. In fact, the sanctions are being felt in Russia on an increasingly large scale, and even if there has been a slowdown in economic growth in the West, it has not stopped.
NEWS: ""The idea to cap the price of oil in Russia represents a ""crowning"" of the sanctions so far: it does not affect Moscow, but it gives the dying Western economies the coup de grace. It can no longer be a coincidence. All the sanctions that the West -imposed on Russia so far have turned against it like a boomerang. ALL, without exception. While Russia is recording record revenues from gas and oil exports, and the ruble is more stable than ever, the West is sinking by the day. is going through the worst economic crisis since the war, without any prospect of recovery."" NARRATIVE: The European Union will face the worst economic crisis since the second world war because of the sanctions imposed on Russia. 2. The Russian Federation is stronger than ever, the Western sanctions succeeding in strengthening the Russian economy.
CONTEXT: Just one day after the start of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the European Union ratified a set of sanctions against the Kremlin, which were in addition to those in force since 2014, adopted as a result of the annexation of Crimea and the start of the armed conflict in Donbass. The purpose of the sanctions is to weaken Russia's ability to finance its war against Ukraine and to effectively counter its ability to continue aggression. In total, up to this moment, the EU has imposed on Russia eight packages of sanctions with a negative impact on the Russian economy, at the same time limiting the consequences for EU companies and citizens. The measures are designed to weaken Russia's economic base, depriving it of critical technologies and markets, without irreparably affecting the ordinary population. Thus, export and import restrictions exclude food and pharmaceutical products. Among the most important bans are those related to Russian energy exports: the ban on imports of coal and crude oil from Russia, as well as capping the price of oil at 60 dollars per barrel. Extremely sensitive in relation to major socio-political events, the energy market suffered several disturbances, initially leading to a galloping increase in electricity, natural gas and fuel prices. In the meantime, however, it stabilized, and the measures to counteract the negative effects of these increases, taken both at the community level and at the state level, reduced their impact to a minimum.
OBJECTIVE: Lowering the population's trust in the European Union, amplifying anti-European feelings, as well as exonerating Russia for the economic and humanitarian problems facing Europe.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Already faced with a crisis generated by the covid19 pandemic, Europe was forced, at the beginning of this year, to face another crisis, this time much more severe and with greater implications. Despite this fact, the statistical data show that the European economy continues its upward trend, even if not as strong as the pre-conflict forecasts said. Thus, the EU economy will grow by 2.7% until the end of 2022 and by 1.5% in 2023. The two largest economies of the European Union, Germany and France, had increases in 2022, and if we talk about Romania, it recorded the second best economic growth in the EU, after that of the Netherlands. And for 2023, Romania's GDP is expected to grow by 2.9%.
At the same time, analyzes based on objective economic indicators, and not on assumptions, show that Russia is going through a period of deep crisis, which is felt at all economic levels. At the macro level, the Russian GDP is expected to decrease by at least 3.4% until the end of the year, and by another 2.3% in 2023, in an optimistic scenario. The sanctions imposed by the Western world produce effects even at the microeconomic level, from the modification of some sweet recipes due to the lack of key ingredients, to the decrease in Internet speed or the bankruptcy of several medium and small businesses. The Russian currency is not ""more stable than ever"", it is artificially maintained at the pre-war level by increasing lending rates, but this line of monetary defense cannot be sustained in the long term. As the sanctions will depreciate the Russian economy , experts say will eventually weigh on the ruble as well. The Central Bank of Russia will not be able to keep raising interest rates indefinitely, as this will eventually stop lending. In the event of a global economic recession, Russia and -could see exports reduced further as demand for its products will disappear first. This could trigger an even steeper collapse of the ruble and a rise in inflation. As for oil exports, we are dealing with also with misinformation, and this is because, although Russia's exports of crude oil and petroleum products have increased, the revenues obtained are lower. The main reason is the drop in crude oil prices, which is greater than the increase in exports.
In conclusion, the narratives are just another part of the Kremlin's arsenal of manipulating information and promoting disinformation about the invasion of Ukraine, with the aim of destabilizing the European Union and its member states. Although in the short term, their impact can be perceived as negative, in time, they will prove their effectiveness. In addition, all sanctions fully respect the obligations arising from international law, including human rights and fundamental freedoms. Publication / Media:

131,633,The losses of the Ukrainian army are so high that students are forced to donate blood for the soldiers,the losses of the Ukrainian army are so high that students are forced to donate blood for the military,False,[],['Ukrainian'],,,,,,,https://deita.ru/article/527993,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-pierderile-armatei-ucrainene-sunt-atat-de-mari-incat-elevii-sunt-fortati-sa-doneze-sange-pentru-militari,,12.12.2022,,Russia,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-pierderile-armatei-ucrainene-sunt-atat-de-mari-incat-elevii-sunt-fortati-sa-doneze-sange-pentru-militari,,"The losses of the Ukrainian army in the war are so high that Ukrainian students are forced to donate blood to the military, according to a propaganda narrative distributed by the Russian media. In reality, minors are prohibited from donating blood in Ukraine, but the authors of the false narrative made other errors that show that we are dealing with an invention.
NEWS: ""In a Ukrainian school in the Cherkasy region, children are forced to donate blood for the government army of Kiev. An announcement from the school management asks students from grades 6-12 to come to the nurse's office to donate blood. Each class has a reserved period in the schedule. The students were told to have the report card, water and a chocolate with them to keep in shape after the procedure.
[...]
After the EU announced that the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost 100 thousand soldiers in the war, a decline in morale is felt in the Ukrainian camp, according to military correspondents and Russian troop commanders"".
NARRATIVE: The losses of the Ukrainian army are so great that the students are forced to donate blood for the soldiers.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The photo published by the Russian press as proof of the existence of an announcement of blood donation by students for the army contains a series of technical inaccuracies that prove that it is a false narrative. First of all, in schools in Ukraine there is no 12th grade, only 11th grade. The Education Law of 2017 introduced the 12th grade, following the European model, starting with the 2018-2019 school year, which means that for the first time the 12th grade will exist in Ukraine in 2031. So, normally, an announcement this way it should be addressed to students from grades 6-11.
Secondly, another condition of the announcement cannot be fulfilled, according to which the student must have the report card with him. Identity documents are issued starting with the 10th grade, the other students only having birth certificates.
In addition, according to Ukrainian legislation, blood donation by minors is prohibited. According to a regulation, adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in 2021, people who have reached the age of 18 and whose body weight is more than 50 kilograms can be blood donors.
Ukrainian television stations encouraged citizens in the spring-summer of the current year to donate blood for the needs of the army, as sufficient blood reserves have been accumulated.
The Russian government press also cited a statement from the European Commission, in which in the initial version it was said about 100 thousand Ukrainian soldiers killed. The number was later corrected, stating that a mistake was made in the EU communiqué. On December 1, the Presidential Administration of Ukraine reacted, emphasizing that it cannot be a question of such a large number of victims among the military, offering a much smaller balance sheet, of 13 thousand.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aimed to demonstrate that the Ukrainian army only suffers losses, while the Russian army is supported by the local population and occupies more and more territories. The Russian press wrote that the leadership of Ukraine wants war to make money and does not care about the suffering of civilians, while only Russian speakers from the east are mobilized because they want to exterminate them. According to Russian propaganda, unemployed people from Ukraine will be drafted into the army and sent to the front, and Kiev gives money to those who trick their friends into enlisting.

In reality, no state has sent regular troops to the Ukrainian territory, the support and assistance given to support the fight against the Russian invasion being only of a material nature. The cited officer, Scott Ritter, is a well-known promoter of fake news, sentenced to prison for corrupting minors.
NEWS: ""Ritter brought new information to the public, such as the participation of large numbers of Romanian and Polish soldiers in the war in Ukraine. The former military man claims that both countries, both Poland and Romania, sent troops to Ukraine, based on official commitments. In addition to the two most reliable allies of Ukraine, Ritter emphasized that the Government in Kiev also benefits from a huge support from the French, the British, the Canadians and the Americans. It is worth noting, however, that the officer clearly points out the help provided by Romania to Ukraine by sending troops, mentioning in the interview a lot of Romanians.""
NARRATIVES: 1. Romania, Poland and Ukraine, following an agreement at governmental level, fight together against Russia. 2. Russia is actually fighting against NATO troops, as Kremlin officials have been saying since the beginning of the war. 3. The Ukrainians must admit their defeat and be satisfied with the current territory not occupied by the Russians, because the more they fight, the more territory they will lose.
CONTEXT: The narrative intensively promoted by Moscow, according to which regular troops of other states are fighting on the side of Ukraine, has been launched since the first month of the Russian invasion. Veridica has repeatedly debunked this disinformation, intended in part to justify Russia's recruitment of troops and mercenaries from Syria, through the already known method of whataboutism. The version circulated in the present case on the Youtube channel Judge Napolitano - Judging Freedom differs only in that it brings into discussion the presence of regular NATO troops. The owner of the channel, former judge Andrew Napolitano, is an extremely controversial character, categorized by the Washington Post as a ""purveyor of conspiracy theories"". Among the theories launched by him is the one in which he considers Abraham Lincoln as the sole culprit for starting the War Civil American or the one in which it claims that the British spy services electronically monitored and intercepted the presidential candidate Donald Trump, on the orders of the acting president Barack Obama. Scott Ritter is a well-known promoter of fake news, being even sanctioned by the Twitter platform for false claims related to the war in Ukraine and incitement to hatred There are rumors that during an official visit to the former USSR in 1988, Ritter was recruited by the KGB through his Russian wife, whom he met - during that period. Not without importance is the information that Ritter was convicted and served a good part of his sentence, among other things, for corruption and illegal contact with minors.
OBJECTIVE: Confirmation from an ""objective"" source of the idea that in Ukraine there is a conflict between Russia and NATO, led by the USA, which is mobilizing human resources to fight against Russian speakers.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: At the moment, Poland and Romania cannot afford, in any way (military, financial or humanitarian), to engage in a war on their own. There is absolutely no treaty between the governments of Romania and Ukraine by which Bucharest commits to sending regular troops to the Ukrainian front. As if anticipating the troubled period to come, the Romanian Ministry of National Defense denied the news that Romanian army troops were on Ukrainian territory ready for war a year ago. According to the same ministry, there is indeed a technical-military agreement between Romania and Ukraine, but it operates only in terms of technical-military cooperation and does not refer to mutual security guarantees and cannot produce effects of an operational nature. In this regard, the former Romanian Minister of Defense, Vasile Dincu, stated several times that Russian officials and Kremlin propagandists resort to such ""false information and intoxication"".
Romania is a full member of NATO, and its reactions are only in accordance with the policy of the Alliance and consist in strengthening the deterrence and defense position on its eastern flank. Ukraine is not a NATO member state, and the partnership between NATO and Ukraine does not stipulate obligations for the allied states to intervene militarily to help Ukraine. As a result, NATO has not sent and does not intend to send troops to Ukraine. There is no evidence that any NATO state, not just Romania and Poland, would have sent soldiers to Ukraine after the Russian invasion. On the contrary, before the start of the invasion, the NATO soldiers known as instructors in Ukraine were withdrawn urgently. Also, the North Atlantic Alliance was careful to avoid any possible incident with the Russian forces. Thus, Kiev's repeated calls to obtain an air exclusion zone that would eliminate the threat to Russian aviation were refused, because NATO does not want a conflict with Russia, which could have dramatic consequences. Instead, it offered support by pressuring Moscow with sanctions and supplying Ukraine with weapons, ammunition, humanitarian aid and funds.
According to the theory launched by Scott Ritter, through the presence of its troops in the middle of the conflict, Poland is actually pursuing their training at the scene of the crime, so that at a well-chosen moment, they will occupy the west of Ukraine to claim as Polish territory, a theory that circulated for some time and which was dismantled in the pages of Veridica. Ritter, on the other hand, does not explain what Romania is pursuing, limiting himself to allusions without any real basis and unconfirmed by any source.
NUTS OF TRUTH: Several Western countries, some NATO members, have allowed their citizens to volunteer in Ukraine. In this sense, the government in Kiev established an International Legion, composed of these volunteers, which supports the defensive efforts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Publication / Media:

In reality, the war in Ukraine is a military aggression by Russia, condemned by the international community, against a neighboring state and people.
NEWS: ""The international press is trying to convince the Russians and the Ukrainians that they are two different peoples, which is not true,"" says the deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, the representative of the United Russia party, in an interview with Ukraina.ru , the first deputy of the head of the committee for tourism and tourist infrastructure, Nicolai Valuev.
""It's a special operation (actually, it's not really a correct name, it's more of a bigger civil war). No matter how much they try to convince us that we are different, in fact we are one people,"" said Valuev [...]
The inhabitants of the planet are told that the special operation is a clash of two peoples, nations, states. In reality, we are talking about one people, and the conflict is a civil war, said the parliamentarian.
NARRATIVE: The armed conflict in Ukraine is a civil war because Russians and Ukrainians are one people.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russian propaganda returns to the narrative regarding the unity of the Russian and Ukrainian people, promoted around the invasion of Ukraine in order to justify the ""special military operation"". This time, the narrative is used to distance Russia from the image of the aggressor - being a civil war, it is an internal conflict, not an inter-state one. Therefore, the other states must not get involved in this conflict. The propaganda narrative manipulates public opinion, selectively using various political, historical and legal arguments , which justifies the military aggression and masks the war crimes committed by Russia on the territory of Ukraine.
The article is based on the metanarrative, ""Ukraine is an artificial state"". In the last two years, the Russian press has shown the reader that the two ""sister states"" are closely related to each other, and the efforts of the West to ""separate"" these former Soviet republics will not succeed. ""Ukraine cannot exist without Russia, being a creation of the USSR, and the Ukrainian language is, in fact, a dialect of the Russian language,"" according to a fake news from 2021.
On July 12, 2021, an article signed by Vladimir Putin himself was published on the Kremlin website, entitled ""On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians"". The disinformation narratives that were disseminated after the publication of this article aligned with political theses of the Kremlin leader. The article repeats the classic narrative about Ukraine as a ""fake state"". For Putin, the Europeanized Ukraine is anti-Russia, which the Russian president wants to combat in his article. Vladimir Putin considers that Russians and Ukrainians are close from a historical point of view or even they are the same people.
In reality, Ukrainians and Russians are not one people. The two languages ​​are not identical, but they are similar in proportion 62%, according to studies; the Ukrainian language is more similar to Belarusian and Polish.
After the invasion of Ukraine, the hatred of Ukrainians towards Russians and Russia reached maximum heights, and the decommunization process was completed with a policy of de-Russification and cultural decolonization.
Russia recognized the independence of Ukraine, offered security guarantees through the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, and undertook to respect its political borders. It violated its own commitments and treaties to which it is a signatory by invading and illegally annexing Crimea, financing the war in Donbass and the invasion of February 24 BC. According to international law, the war in Ukraine is a military aggression. The member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine, a series of mechanisms being launched at the international level to designate Russia as a state that finances terrorism. In November of this year, the European Parliament declared Russia a ""state sponsor of terrorism"", the actions of the Kremlin being criticized for violating the norms of international law and destroying the foundations of global security.
The UN General Assembly also voted a resolution in favor of creating a compensation mechanism for the destruction - of a human and material nature - caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of similar false narratives regarding Russia's ""historical right"" to invade the Ukrainian state. The Russian press wrote that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia, and because of the neo-Nazi propaganda of Kiev, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated by Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion in 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself from a NATO aggression, having to save Donbass from genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

In reality, Ukraine showed itself willing to hold peace negotiations, but gave up the idea because of Russia's ultimate demands and its attacks on civilian targets, but also against the background of the victories achieved by the Ukrainian army in the field.
NEWS: ""Ukraine rejects the West's allusions to negotiate with Russia, trying its best to prolong the conflict because it benefits from it,"" writes journalist Reinhard Lauterbach on December 5 on the pages of the German publication Junge Welt. [...]
Kiev does not want peace, because it ""lives from this military conflict"" and wants to have as much profit as possible now. The journalist emphasizes that the Ukrainian side in these conditions receives an unlimited amount of weapons and money. ""Politicians do not care that the Ukrainians are cold and hungry,"" the article says.
[...]
The president of the Servant of the People parliamentary group, David Arahamia, announced a new condition necessary for the resumption of negotiations with the Russian Federation, which consisted in Moscow's voluntary renunciation of its nuclear arsenal, Gazeta.ru recalls.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine is interested in prolonging the war, being indifferent to the suffering of civilians.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Russian-Ukrainian military conflict cannot be in the interest of Ukrainian politicians, who are fighting hard to overcome the effects of war fatigue, caused by the destruction of the energy infrastructure, the killing of civilians, the impoverishment of the population and permanent mobilization. The false narrative also appears under the title ""The Government of Ukraine continues to benefit from the war"" or ""The press found out the real reason for Kiev's refusal to negotiate with Moscow"". An opinion article from the German newspaper ""Junge Welt"" is cited, presented as the point of view of the entire society.
The newspaper is considered to be of the extreme left, of Marxist orientation, continuing the German communist and socialist traditions. After the invasion of Ukraine, Junge Welt also published a series of articles that copied the false narratives of Russian propaganda. It is a newspaper cited by the Russian government media to illustrate their own propaganda narratives or to present them as an independent point of view. At the end of November, Ukraina.ru, quoting Junge Welt, wrote without providing any concrete evidence that Ukrainian refugees were beating the residents of Berlin who speak Russian.
In reality, the losses of society, of the Ukrainian political and economic elite following the war are enormous. The infrastructure is destroyed, the state's debts increase, and everyone's income decreases. The economic potential of the state is less and less. Large factories, refineries, enterprises of the Ukrainian oligarchs were destroyed or seriously affected, a number of economic fields stopped their activity. Economic life is put on hold. According to estimates, the destruction in Ukraine caused by the Russian bombing exceeded 137 billion dollars, increasing by 31 billion monthly. The cost of the unprovoked invasion of Russia is enormous and cannot in any way be in the interest of the government in Kiev, which is trying to maintain control over the critical situation in the country.
Also, Kiev is accused of indifference to the suffering of civilians because it refuses to negotiate with Russia. In reality, the suffering of civilians is only caused by Russia's energy terrorism and the bombing of non-military infrastructure. Russia is the one that shows indifference to the lives of civilians, creating increasingly complicated living conditions for them in the hope that they will ask Kiev to give in, which is not happening. The resistance message of the Ukrainians, valid for the winter period, became more and more popular: ""Better in the cold, but in freedom"". In addition, at this moment both sides hope to win on the battlefield, so neither is interested in serious negotiations.
Regarding the proposal of the president of the parliamentary group ""Servant of the people"" David Arahamia to Russia to give up its nuclear arsenal, this took place in a special context - around the 28th anniversary of the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, when Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from Russia and other states, which Moscow has violated.Trying to remind Russia that it is not keeping its own promises and agreements signed in the past, another member of the Zelenski team, the presidential advisor Mihailo Podoliak, said: ""Ukraine is willing to guarantee the security of the Russian Federation in exchange for the complete renunciation of nuclear weapons. We can sign an agreement in the same town - in Budapest, Hungary"".
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media about the nature and true causes of the war in Ukraine. Russian propaganda claims that the United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, in order to push it to war against Russia. Also, the Russian press wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. According to the false narratives of the Kremlin, Russia shows restraint in the war in Ukraine, especially when it attacks civilian targets and aims to defend all Russian speakers from the genocide committed by Ukrainians.

In reality, Chisinau supplies Transnistria with all the gas it currently buys from Gazprom and uses other sources for consumers on the right side of the Dniester.
NEWS: ""In the conditions of a large energy crisis, Maia Sandu's team, instead of identifying solutions, came into conflict with Transnistria, which supplies the most important amount of cheap electricity. Fulfilling the instructions of the West, the government in Chisinau worsens relations with the main supplier of energy resources, the Russian Federation, thus forcing the increasingly poor Moldovans to pay more for gas and electricity. In addition, taking advantage of the situation, Moldovan officials do not forget to fill their own pockets.
[...]
Maia Sandu's regime fulfills the same tasks as Ukraine - to promote an anti-Russian policy and provoke a potential armed confrontation with Russia.
[...]
According to Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spanu, the republic procures electricity from Romania, but on November 23, a large-scale blackout cast doubt on his statements. The supply of energy was stopped practically in the entire territory of the country after a massive Russian attack on the Ukrainian infrastructure.
This made the Moldovans wonder why the situation in Ukraine affects the delivery of energy, since it is procured from Romania? Or do we pay for electricity from Ukraine at the price of that from Romania?
Thus, the authorities uncovered a conspiracy.
[...]
The scheme is simple: high-ranking officials sell, through the Ukrainians, part of the gas they buy at a reduced price. In other words, the Moldovan authorities do not provide their population with gas and electricity, but sell them more expensively to the European Union""
NARRATIVES: 1. The government in Chisinau fulfills the orders of the West, which intends to involve the Republic of Moldova in the war in Ukraine. 2. The Chisinau government resells the cheap gas it receives from Russia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is facing a large energy crisis in the last year, which deepened with the invasion of Russia in Ukraine. In addition to the prices of energy resources that have increased several times, the Republic of Moldova is also facing a shortage of resources after Gazprom reduced deliveries starting on October 1. Since October, the country has stopped importing electricity from Ukraine, after its energy system was seriously affected by the Russian bombings, and since November, the Transnistrian region, where most of the electricity came from, stopped deliveries, saying that no it receives enough gas to produce electricity.
The Republic of Moldova started making gas reserves, which it stores in Ukraine and Romania. It also started importing electricity from Romania.
Moldova's energy system was also affected by the Russian bombings, and in several cases part of its territory was disconnected from electricity, during the missile attacks in Ukraine. The authorities explained that this happened because the energy systems of the two countries are interconnected.
OBJECTIVE: To induce the idea that the West totally controls the authorities in Chisinau and is trying to involve the Republic of Moldova in the war in Ukraine. To reduce citizens' trust in the pro-European government, accused of using the complicated situation to enrich themselves.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the war on the side of Ukraine is one of the most frequent false narratives used by Russian propaganda, despite the fact that it is a neutral state, with an underdeveloped army and military capabilities, so that it would not present any threat to the Russian Federation.
Regarding the accusations that the Republic of Moldova would resell the gas received from Russia, the authorities from Chisinau previously stated that this is not possible, and the suggestion that Ukraine would continue to deliver cheap electricity is not valid, primarily because Kiev announced that it has started importing electricity.
the electricity in the Republic of Moldova was disconnected during the Russian bombings because the energy systems of the two countries are interconnected.
""The Russian bombings on the Ukrainian power plants led to interruptions in our country because the energy systems of Moldova and Ukraine are connected to each other. The critical situation in Ukraine led to the automatic interruption of a transit line through which electricity is imported from Romania.
This interruption took place to protect networks and electrical stations from overload. If the automatic disconnection is not applied, the electrical stations could be seriously affected and the interruptions would last longer"", explained the Chisinau government.
The main argument that proves that the Russian media manipulated is that starting from December, the Republic of Moldova resumed the import of electricity from the left bank of the Dniester, delivering to the separatist region all the gas it receives from Gazprom. The territory to the right of the Dniester uses the gas from the reserves it has stored in Ukraine and Romania. This shows that the Republic of Moldova did not sell gas to the West, but made reserves. Publication / Media:

In reality, Ukraine was invaded by Russia, and the supply of weapons to Kiev was a reaction to Russian aggression.
NEWS: ""The conflict in Ukraine started in 2014 after the Euromaidan, and the US has been fueling it ever since,"" the former president of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), Oskar Lafontaine, said in an interview for Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten. According to the former head of this party, Washington and its allies kept arming Ukraine and systematically prepared Kiev for confrontation with Russia, and the result was that Ukraine actually became a member of NATO [...]
At the same time, Washington failed to achieve its goals against Russia. Lafontaine believes that the US admits that they broke their teeth, because they understood that Russia as a nuclear state cannot be defeated militarily. Moreover, the anti-Russian sanctions hit the West like a boomerang, he said.
NARRATIVES: The United States armed Ukraine starting in 2014, to push it to war against Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: From the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 BC. the Russian government press is resorting more and more often to quoting journalists, politicians or people of culture politically or ideologically close to the Kremlin to illustrate their own propaganda narratives. Oskar Lafontaine is a far-left politician who has a pro-Russian and anti-American position. He participated in a series of meetings with Russian experts and politicians or with communist, pro-Russian, pro-Kremlin separatist leaders from Donbass, where topics such as ""Nazism in Ukraine"", ""the consolidation of the communist movement around the world"" were discussed ""The creation of communist resistance battalions"". He is a politician who is increasingly marginalized on the territory of Germany.
Oskar Lafontaine resumes one of Russia's false narratives, launched before the invasion of Ukraine, according to which NATO and the USA had been preparing a war against the Russian people for several years. The preparations would have started in 2014, after a ""coup d'état"" had taken place in Ukraine.
In reality, no coup d'état took place in Ukraine, and the change of power occurred after a series of street riots, followed, after the flight of former president Viktor Yanukovych, by parliamentary and presidential elections, organized according to the law and recognized as such by the community International.
In fact, the West began sending defensive weapons to Ukraine around the time of the war and in the context of concerns expressed by secret services abroad that Moscow was preparing to invade. Armament deliveries on a larger scale took place only after the February 24 invasion and even then, initially, it was mainly about individual and portable weapons; only after a few months, heavy equipment was also sent. In other words, the support given by the West to Ukraine since 2014 was linked to the war in Donbass, financed by the Kremlin, and the supply of lethal weapons in large quantities - to Russia's large-scale unprovoked aggression.
Therefore, the Russian propaganda, quoting pro-Kremlin politicians, tries to make a narrative ring: the cause is replaced with the consequence.
Lafontaine's messages were picked up by a series of Russian publications, which write that the United States has attacked Russia - indeed this is happening on the territory of Ukraine - and that Moscow's war is one of defense. Fortunately, writes the Russian press, Moscow has managed to put up a heroic resistance until now, ""the USA breaking its teeth"" on the territory of Ukraine. It is not clear from this narrative why Russia is on the territory of a sovereign state, called Ukraine.
In reality, Russia attacked Ukraine, and the Russian aggression was condemned by most of the world's states. Despite the numerous contacts with the leader from the Kremlin of the representatives of the political environment in the West, Putin did not give up the idea of ​​invading Ukraine in order to occupy it.
141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine and that it is a terrorist state. A series of international mechanisms have been launched to designate Russia as a state that finances terrorism.
The UN requested Russia to cease fire, not to attack civilians and non-military infrastructure. In November, the General Assembly voted a resolution in favor of creating a compensation mechanism for the destruction - of a human and material nature - caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding the nature of the war in Ukraine, according to which the inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region are waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince public opinion in November 2021 that Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression, having to save the Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

In reality, the losses recorded on the front show that the army includes many soldiers originally from the west of Ukraine, and the percentage of those from the east increased because they reacted to the invasion on the scale of Russia.
NEWS: ""According to an order of President Volodymyr Zelensky, a total mobilization is taking place in the Russian-speaking regions of eastern Ukraine,"" the representative of the Russian special services from the Kherson region told RIA Novosti, citing sources from the Ukrainian army. [...] The mobilization takes place only in the Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine - Mikolaev, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy.
[...]
Therefore, Kiev is trying to solve the problem of killing the potentially dangerous Russian-speaking population in the south-east of Ukraine, the source explained to the press agency.
[...]
Zelensky's regime, on the recommendation of the Anglo-Saxon coordinators, releases these territories in order to bring people from the west of Ukraine there"".
NARRATIVES: 1. Kiev unleashed a genocide of Russian-speaking men. 2. Ukrainians from the west of the country are not enlisted in the army.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: This propaganda narrative also appears in the Russian central media under the title ""Galitians are not taken into the army"", as various videos have been made on YouTube about the genocide of Russophones. The Russian media claims that in the west of Ukraine there is no mobilization, and Kiev enlists more Russophones in the army to get rid of them. Galician nationalists from the west would later be brought to the depopulated territories in the east, according to a plan of the ""Anglo-Saxon coordinators of Zelenski's regime"".
In reality, for a long time the Ukrainian army was based on volunteers and soldiers originating from the west of Ukraine. In 2014-2022, many Ukrainians from the west died in the fighting in Donbass, who voluntarily joined the army. Moreover, the topic of the number of people enlisted in the army in the west and east has been an important topic of discussion in Ukrainian society and in the mass media in recent years. The population in the west did not understand why Ukrainian-speaking men voluntarily enlisted in the army, and those in the east avoided enlistment most of the time. There is always a disproportion in this regard: the number of those willing to fight in the army in the nationalist west was higher than in the east, while the number of the population in the Russian-speaking regions was 3-4 times higher!
For this reason, after Russia's launch of the large-scale invasion against Ukraine, Kiev made the decision to oblige men who have the status of internally displaced persons to register compulsorily after a few days of stay at the military commissariat. This registration does not mean a mandatory mobilization, but it allows Kiev to evaluate its own human resources in this war. The decision calmed spirits in Ukraine, reducing this internal cleavage to a minimum.
The Russian press, however, built various propaganda narratives from these decisions of Kiev, according to which men with the status of internally displaced persons are persecuted, sent to the front, and women remain without any protection. Moreover, these people would be treated with hostility when they arrive in other areas and would even be fined for so-called violations of the law, invented by the authorities. Such propaganda narratives were dismantled by Veridica.
An overview of the main local news agencies in western Ukraine shows daily announcements in all communities regarding the funerals of soldiers killed in the war, which means that a significant number of people from the west continue to fight in the armed forces.
It is true that the percentage of Russophones in the army also increased, but this happened because, unlike the war in Donbass from 2014-2022, Russophones mobilized in a much larger number in the face of the large-scale aggression of the Federation Russians. According to a study, at least half of the Ukrainian soldiers speak Russian among themselves. At the same time, according to a survey, a third of Russian speakers switched to the Ukrainian language after Russia invaded Ukraine. These linguistic differences became more symbolic and not so important politically after the invasion of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding the mobilization process in Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, unemployed people from Ukraine will be drafted into the army and sent to the front, and the Ukrainian army gives money to those who trick their friends into enlisting. In May, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine is mobilizing a million soldiers, paying with human beings for Western loans. Other propaganda narratives followed, according to which the EU will deport refugee men to Ukraine to be conscripted into the Ukrainian army, while volunteers enroll in pro-Russian battalions that will defend the country's southeastern regions from the Ukrainian army.

The disinformation appears in a dialogue between Luis Lazarus and Diana Iovanovici-Sosoaca. Sprinkled with mystical nonsense, lies, but also elements reminiscent of Nazi propaganda, he came as a result of the first ""blackout"" exercise in Romania, held two weeks ago at Medias.
NEWS: ,,Luis Lazarus: There is a rumor that ""these"" could even leave us without electricity during the holidays in order to punish us, to make fun of us. [...] message from a citizen: [...] I have been living in Denmark for 34 years. I have friends who are trained for what is to come. The Romanian blackout is not something local, so that we are left without electricity, but it is a European action. Denmark has windmills and wind. But many are stopped and will be stopped, the owners being paid by the German government better than if they produce electricity. I said well German and not Danish. Likewise, Germany will stop the nuclear power plant, the platforms in the North Sea are more all the time stop. Blackout is desperately wanted. Danish police troops have trained in front of the world for actions in homes, in different cities. [...] In all totalitarian systems there have been atrocities. Now their time has come here too. [...] He will say that they are talking about a European blackout action in which Romania is also included and they are talking about troops and people who are specially trained. Here, it was seen in Denmark, says the man, that they are trained to enter houses. The question is to enter where? To come over father Veta from Poplaca? Should Ion come in from school? No, they are trained to enter where they need to be. So, Diana, when the blackout comes, I say get in the car with some friends and come visit you.
Diana Iovanovici Sosoaca: I don't think you are safe with me, because 3 days ago I received a visit from someone who told me to pack your bags and leave! [...] He wasn't joking at all and he told me exactly the same thing about these bands, he says you are the first on the list of those who will be exterminated in the blackout. I expect absolutely anything. When the Ukrainians invaded Romania, I was told that racketeers kill for a thousand euros. I was told to stop making appreciations or disapprovals regarding the Ukrainians who come to Romania because they might close my mouth themselves. [...] The blackout only exists when scheduled. What they are doing now is called a new plandemic. The Covid social experiment continues. Agenda 2030 must be implemented. [...] There can only be a power cut if someone gives the order to turn off the light!"" NARRATIVES: 1. The UN Agenda 2030 is actually an evil plan of the world occult to enslave the population of the planet. 2. Romania will be targeted, along with other European states, by an energy attack around the winter holidays. 3. Inconvenient people who do not align with globalist policies will be physically eliminated during the chaos generated by the ""blackout"". of intelligence among all races.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: Blackouts, that is, massive power outages that affect large regions, one or even several countries, are rare, but they do happen from time to time. Their causes are among the most diverse, such as the software error in 2003 that affected the Northeast of the United States and the Canadian province of Ontario, or the storm that caused a chain failure of the power plants in southern Brazil in 1999. Also, they can be caused by the lack of fuel that powers power plants, as happened last year in Lebanon, or by cyber attacks such as those launched by the so-called Sandworm group on Ukraine starting in 2016, and the examples can continue. The subject of the danger of massive power outages in Europe came to the attention of public opinion a year ago, with the launch, in Austria, of an information campaign for the population, through which it was prepared in the event of a ""blackout"" that would affect the functioning of many basic services. At that time, Veridica dismantled the fake news launched following the event, but the topic returned to the public space with the energy crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the frequent power outages that have occurred recently in Ukraine and Moldova.In this context, the Romanian authorities simulated, in a three-day exercise, various scenarios related to a large-scale power outage at Medias.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting sovereignist and anti-Western discourse, self-victimization for purely electoral purposes, propagation of Russian propaganda messages in the context of the invasion of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The 2030 Agenda referred to by Diana Sosoaca is nothing more than a UN program that targets equally developed and developing countries, which aims, among other things, to eradicate poverty, develop education and of health, as well as that of peaceful and inclusive societies. Nowhere in this program is the digital camp invoked by Diana Sosoaca and her interlocutor discussed.
The idea that Romania could be the target of the ""globalists"" and Brussels is absurd in the conditions in which Bucharest has been aligning itself with EU and NATO policies for years, the Romanian economy is largely integrated into the global one, and the Romanian workforce benefits from the freedom of movement to find better paid jobs outside the country.In fact, the simultaneous organization in Bucharest of three meetings - NATO, the leaders of the Munich Conference and that of the G7 foreign ministers shows exactly this.
Regarding the scheduled blackout, until this moment, no European authority or official has warned that a blackout at the EU level is imminent or inevitable, nor has he predicted its extent or duration. Both community and local institutions only state that the possibility of a blackout must be ""taken into account"". Estimating threats to national security, anticipating possible crises and preventing them is a matter of routine for many states, so that the various institutions, the authorities and the population to know how to react and what they have to do. Terrorism, natural disasters, massive cyber attacks, the collapse of strategic infrastructure, etc. are among the threats/risks usually taken into account and for which preparations are made. In Romania, by for example, exercises simulating a major earthquake are regularly organized and there are campaigns in which the population is informed how they should react in the event of such a disaster. In essence, it is about developing a culture of being prepared, of being able to respond prompt and efficient in extreme cases.
Continuing the narrative thread of the speech, we know very well that the physical suppression of uncomfortable people is, in fact, a practice of the autocratic regime that Senator Sosoaca invokes to be on the side of justice; moreover, Diana Ivanovici Sosoaca did not provide any evidence in support of her statements.
The rest of the marathon dialogue, lasting over 3 hours, brings into discussion themes of Nazi propaganda (The IQ of all the peoples of the world has been measured. Where do you think the highest IQ in the world is? Of the population of Europe. Of the whites. It's about now of the destruction of the Caucasian European race.), well-known disinformation of Russian origin, as well as themes of Romanian nationalist-mystical delirium, without even indicating a real source of the information provided. Contrary to the absurd statements of the independent senator, the intelligence superiority of the white race is not highlighted by any statistics. In the same way, the genius of the Romanian people has no real cover either, as the argument for the invalidation of this theory is the disastrous state of Romanian education, which Diana Sosoaca also invokes.

It quotes a controversial American political scientist, known for promoting numerous conspiracy theories and enthusiastic support for Vladimir Putin.
NEWS: ""The strikes on Ukraine's infrastructure have shown that Russia can destroy this state in a short period of time,"" writes the American political analyst, former collaborator of the White House during the Ronald Administration, in an article on his website on November 25 Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts. He claims that Russia shows restraint towards Ukraine because of the historical unity of the two states.
It seems that the Russians do not want to destroy everything... Russia could turn Ukraine into ruins in a single day without the use of nuclear weapons. The Kremlin's restraint has a number of explanations. Ukraine and its population have been part of Russia for centuries. There are many mixed marriages. The majority of Ukrainians do not support the neo-Nazis who have ruled Ukraine since 2014, when the US organized a coup d'état in Kiev... The Kremlin does not want to have a poor and ruined state near its borders and then be responsible for rebuilding the Ukrainian infrastructure "".
NARRATIVE: Moscow shows restraint when bombing Ukraine because it knows that the population does not support the neo-Nazi government
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russia has launched an intense bombing campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure targets since October.
On October 10, Russia launched 84 missiles and 24 drones at Ukraine, with a total average value of 700 million dollars, according to Forbes. More than half of the missiles were shot down by the anti-aircraft defense system, according to Kiev. On November 15, Russian forces fired about 100 missiles at Ukraine, hitting several essential energy infrastructures in different regions, several Ukrainian cities were left without electricity. It was the most massive missile attack in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The initial pretext for the attacks was that Moscow was responding to the explosion that damaged the bridge over the Kerch Strait, although the nature of the first bombing clearly shows that it had been prepared in advance, a few days before the explosion on the bridge. Later, Moscow claimed that it was bombing the civilian infrastructure to reduce the capacity of the Ukrainian army, then the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, explicitly said that Ukraine can ""end"" the suffering of the population (and the bombing of the infrastructure) if it accepts Moscow's demands; finally, the Russian ambassador to the UN claimed that, in fact, the infrastructure was not damaged by Russian missiles but by Ukrainian anti-aircraft.
Moreover, Russia did not show restraint from the beginning of the war, but it kept trying to convince its citizens that it was saving Russian-speakers in Ukraine from Nazism and that it had launched the ""special military operation"" to protect the peaceful Ukrainian population. In fact, it still since the beginning of the war, civilians have repeatedly been the target of Russian attacks, notable cases include the bombing of the theater in Mariupol, the railway station in Kramatorsk, the convoy near Zaporozhye, the killing of civilians in Kiev, Lvov and other cities. add the numerous Russian attacks on residential areas, educational and medical institutions, the thousands of war crimes. Several mass graves, torture centers, citizen filtering centers were discovered, which indicate the existence of a Moscow-level strategy of intentional destruction of civilian targets to achieve military-political goals.
In the article published on Ukraina.ru, an American political analyst is quoted who illustrates the propaganda theses of the Kremlin. In fact, Paul Craig Roberts is not an independent political scientist, but an ardent supporter of Russia who, in addition, has been accused of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial, as well as promoting numerous conspiracy theories, including about the attacks by on September 11 or the assassination of American President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. In 2016, according to Russian media, Roberts applied for Russian citizenship.
In the years 2014-2022, he is the most cited American political analyst by the Russian press, promoting the Kremlin's official narratives: the US organized a coup d'état in Ukraine, neo-Nazis are in power in Kiev, Ukrainians are part of the Russian people, the press the American one misinforms the public opinion, and the Russian one tells the truth. Like other influential agents of Russia in the Western countries, Paul Craig Roberts confirms all the propaganda theses of the Russian media.
Roberts also took up the topic of Ukrainian neo-Nazism, about which Veridica recently wrote, dismantling another similar false narrative, amplified by the Polish political scientist Konrad Rekas. In reality, the Ukrainian authorities cannot be compared to a Nazi regime, and Russia's war is one of invading a territory, an unprovoked act of aggression condemned by the international community.
In July 2015, Ukraine prohibited by law any public manifestation of communist and Nazi ideology, so the statement that this state must be ""denazified"" is meaningless. In addition, the Ukrainian military participated in the Soviet army's victory over Nazism. Nazism and communism are prohibited on the territory of Ukraine.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media, according to which the inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region are waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince the Russian society without any evidence that the nationalist leader Stepan Bandera was canonized in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

It also writes that the invitation of the Republic of Moldova to the NATO meeting in Bucharest represents a violation of its neutrality status and a further confirmation that this country is already ""with one foot"" in NATO.
NEWS: ""There is no doubt that the last impediment for the open accession of the Republic of Moldova to NATO - art. 11 of the Constitution - they are extremely irritating to the president and the PAS parliamentary majority, but they can't do anything, for now.
Even if PAS holds the parliamentary majority, it needs five more votes to amend the Constitution and has nowhere to get them. For this reason, many believe, the actions of the state bodies against the opposition deputies are aimed at identifying some levers of pressure on them to make them vote for the exclusion of the neutrality article from the Constitution.
Since the beginning of November, around the NATO summit in Bucharest, the Chisinau officials have amplified their activities in this direction. On November 10, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration Nicu Popescu met in Paris with the French Minister of Defense Sebastien Lecornu to discuss the collaboration in the military field"". Popescu later announced that ""we agreed to improve the dialogue between the Defense Ministries of the two states"". Improving dialogue also means joint military exercises. And all this in the context of the attempts to amend the Constitution and annul the status of neutrality of Moldova""
NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European government in Chisinau wants to force the Republic of Moldova to join NATO and is ready to even risk a war with Russia. 2. The government in Chisinau is putting pressure on the opposition, including through the judiciary, to cancel the neutrality statute in the Constitution.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova is provided for in the Constitution voted in 1994 by a leftist parliament. Maintaining the status quo is promoted by pro-Moscow politicians, who present it as a guarantor of the country's security, although the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that this is not the case.
The collaboration of the Republic of Moldova with NATO started back in the 90s, and one of the most important projects of NATO was the evacuation of important quantities of pesticides, left over from the Soviet era and which represented a danger to the environment.
However, the North Atlantic Alliance is still presented as a scarecrow for a good part of the population of the Republic of Moldova, who sees it through the prism of Soviet propaganda and, more recently, of the Russian Federation.
The ""risk"" of the Republic of Moldova joining NATO or the opening of military bases of the Alliance on the territory of the Republic of Moldova is frequently invoked by pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau, although there have never been discussions in this regard at the official level.
Misinformation about NATO's alleged activities in the Republic of Moldova, the construction of military bases or even possible accession to NATO appear periodically in the Russian and Russian-language media from the Republic of Moldova, being fueled by the statements or allusions of some left-wing politicians.
Government representatives have stated several times that the status of neutrality does not represent a sure guarantee of security, but no steps have been taken to amend the Constitution in this regard.
OBJECTIVE: To present the pro-European government in Chisinau as one controlled by the West, which puts its interests in the foreground, to the detriment of the citizens. To inoculate the idea that the current government is hostile to Russia and is dangerous for ensuring security in the region. To present the processes and files in the name of some politicians who would have been involved in acts of corruption, as politically instrumented with the aim of exerting pressure on the opposition.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Joining NATO has never been discussed at an official level and, at this moment, there is no initiative to amend the Constitution and renounce the status of neutrality; moreover, the pro-Europeans in power have not even announced their support for such an initiative. And if the population and the political class would like the Republic of Moldova to join NATO, even if the problem were to arise, it is very unlikely that the Republic of Moldova would be accepted into NATO with an unresolved territorial conflict, with a foreign military presence on its territory and with one of the smallest defense budgets in the world, less than 0.4% of GDP.
The government in Chisinau, which has repeatedly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, is trying to obtain more support from the West, including receiving assurances of assistance to strengthen its defense capabilities, but this does not imply joining NATO - even the countries neutrals must have the ability to defend themselves.
Several pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau, such as the ex-leader of the Socialists Igor Dodon and that of the Sor Party, Ilan Sor, are targeted in corruption cases, and the affiliated mass media are trying to present the cases as political, at the behest of the government. The accusations of corruption against them - and, in some cases, the investigations and prosecutions - predate the war in Ukraine and the PAS coming to power.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: There are representatives of the government who would opt for renouncing the status of neutrality and joining NATO, but these decisions would be impossible in the short or medium term. Publication / Media:

141,643,"Already conquered by the West, Romania allows itself to be stepped on by Ukraine","Romania receives orders from Ukraine, which, in addition, undermines its economy.",False,[],"['West', 'Romania', 'Ukraine']",,,,,,,https://inpolitics.ro/fost-premier-roman-cind-stranuta-zelenski-ai-nostri-de-la-bucuresti-racesc-ne-comportam-ca-slugi_1841800838.html,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-deja-cucerita-de-occident-romania-se-lasa-calcata-in-picioare-si-de-ucraina,,23.11.2022,,,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-deja-cucerita-de-occident-romania-se-lasa-calcata-in-picioare-si-de-ucraina,,"With its sovereignty at the mercy of the great Western powers, Romania is now facing Kiev and dismissed its Defense Minister, Vasile Dancu, just because he spoke of peace, according to the former prime minister, Viorica Dancila. The narrative is reminiscent of Russia's, according to which Ukraine - the country under attack - is the one that does not want peace. Viorica Dancila also promoted the false narrative that Ukraine undermines agriculture and, implicitly, Romania's economy.
NEWS: ""I tend to believe Mr. From. He came out with a statement that I think was disturbing, he said that peace must be negotiated. After he came out with this statement, that the great powers must sit at the table and negotiate peace, I saw that Mr. President came out against him, who told him to read the press, the PSD president did not come out with any reaction support of Mr. Dincu... There is another aspect - let's not forget that there was also a reaction from the Ukrainian side - my feeling at the moment is that when Mr. Zelenski sneezes, our people in Bucharest catch a cold. We behaved like servants. Products from Ukraine full of pesticides entered the Romanian market, and our farmers have big problems. [...] Mr. Zelenski's recent attitude has led to a lack of credibility, because he has shown that he does not trust those who have analyzed what happened in Poland, neither the Polish nor the American side, he insisted on being part of the analysis, as if he were the one in control, and this is not done. I believe that in the coming period there will be more and more voices that will campaign for peace, more and more countries will support peace.""
NARRATIVES: 1. Vasile Dancu was dismissed because he wants peace in Ukraine. 2. Romania has become the servant of Ukraine. 3. Ukraine is to blame for Romania's economic problems.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Noted in the political life of Romania mainly due to the blunders and failures during her term as prime minister, Viorica Dancila is trying to return to the foreground, by appearing in the friendly media, on broadcasts of journalists as embarrassing as his performance at the head of the government. Marching on the sovereignist discourse, the only type of discourse that can still produce some changes in the options of the local electorate, the former prime minister ""adhered"" to the narratives that sing the praises of Romania's independence, adding considerations about the war in Ukraine that seem to be ""borrowed"" from Russian propaganda; the latter launched them with the aim of obtaining a reduction in the international community's support for Ukraine.
The idea of ​​peace negotiations in Ukraine has been promoted, lately, more and more intensively by Russia, given that its forces are under pressure and have suffered a series of defeats on the ground. The spokesman of the Kremlin, Dmitri Peskov, even cynically stated that Ukraine is to blame for the fact that Russia is bombing its civil infrastructure, because it does not accept peace talks. In other words, Peskov admitted that, in the absence of military solutions, Russia is trying to force Ukraine to talk by terrorizing its population and throwing it, on the eve of winter, into the cold and darkness. Ukraine, on the other hand, as an aggressed state, cannot negotiate until Russia withdraws its forces from its territory - a possibility ruled out by the Kremlin with the illegal annexation, at the end of September, of four Ukrainian regions. Practically, through its territorial claims on Ukraine, Russia is the one blocking the possibility of any peace negotiations. However, as it needs these negotiations, at least to get a break to regroup its forces, the Kremlin is trying to exert direct pressure on Kiev, through bombings, but also indirectly, through Ukraine's allies. It is intended to undermine the support that Western countries offer to Ukraine by creating the image that the latter wants to wage war at any price and any sacrifice; the energy crisis in the West is already meant to exert another type of pressure, the idea being pursued is the creation of a mentality of the type ""we suffer for Ukraine and it does not want to make any compromise"".
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the sovereignist discourse for electoral purposes.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In a speech that abounds in extremely gross grammatical mistakes (like a job, like a minister, like a country, you serve, you yourself (with reference to your own person), because in order to join, no one put us in order to, we see them there only standing, aspects that did not meet, I did not propose to attack, the good things we were doing), Viorica Dancila tries to paraphrase the famous expression of no less the famous Prussian diplomat von Metternich, When France sneezes, the whole of Europe catches a cold, but missing the explanation of its use. Probably, Mrs. Dancila wanted to say that Vasile Dincu was dismissed from the position of Minister of Defense at the request of Volodimir Zelenski, a theory which, we hope you agree with us, is absurd enough not to deserve a professional debunking. We will only mention that the position of Romania's EU and NATO allies, a position shared by Bucharest, is that Ukraine is the only one in a position to decide when, what and if it will negotiate with Russia. NATO, the EU and implicitly Romania have repeatedly conveyed that they respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, which the aggressor state, Russia, violated and continues to violate. With his statement that ""the only chance for peace can be negotiation with Ukraine"", the former Minister of Defense only distanced himself from the official positions of Romania and its allies and indirectly promoted Moscow's interests and Russian propaganda. , Vasile Dancu was not dismissed but resigned, after the head of the government he was part of, Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca, President Klaus Iohannis - who is also supreme commander of the army - but also the head of the PSD president, the party that proposed him for the position of defense minister, they criticized him for his slippage.
Regarding the problems of Romanian farmers caused by the imports of products ""full of pesticides"" from Ukraine, it is obvious that we are dealing with another disinformation. Add the terrible drought and the increase in fuel prices this year to the already existing problems of Romanian agriculture , and blaming Ukrainian imports for the agricultural crisis we are going through becomes at most a bad joke. Agricultural products from Ukraine, a country that actually still allows the use of pesticides that have been banned in the European Union, are rarely if ever destined for the Romanian market. They they are only in transit on the territory of Romania and their final destination is Africa or South America. In addition, when it comes to pesticides used in excess, Romania has been facing this situation for some time, independently of imports from Ukraine. Another problem caused of agricultural products imported from Ukraine could be represented by the drop in prices, a situation that can be considered a problem, but this fact represents normality in a free market where the price is set freely, depending on demand and supply.
The reprimand brought to the Ukrainian president for requesting that a team from Kiev be part of the investigation commission of the November 15 incident is absurd in its turn, Volodymyr Zelenski's request being as legitimate as possible in the given context. In a similar situation, Russia's participation in the investigation of sabotage on the Nord Stream pipelines, not only was allowed by the international community, but has already taken place. Former Prime Minister Dancila's predictions that ""more and more countries will support peace"" are mere speculations, opinion polls at the European level still indicate a wide popular support enjoyed by Ukraine in the war of defense against Russian aggression.
We can't help but notice at the end, with a smile in the corner of the mouth, the involuntary irony of the moderator who asks Viorica Dancila to analyze the performance of the current prime minister, Nicolae Ciuca, in English, and her answer to the question:
- How do you assess the activity of the Ciuca government?

In reality, the Dutch court recognized Russia's involvement in this crime against civilians.
NEWS: ""The Hague Tribunal did not directly link the use of the Buk anti-aircraft defense system against flight MH17 with Russia in the investigation into the 2014 Malaysian Boeing crash in eastern Ukraine, following the catastrophe that killed 298 people , reports RIA Novosti, referring to the announcement of the verdict in the courtroom.
Previously, the court found guilty the Russians Igor (Strelkov) Girkin, Serghei Dubinski and the Ukrainian Leonid Harcenko for shooting down the plane and killing 298 passengers. [...] The Dutch court decided that the culprits will have to pay the families of the victims a total of 16 million euros.
The press agency mentioned that during the hearing, the president-judge Hendrik Steenhuis spoke exclusively about the responsibility of the four defendants, without touching on the subject of Russia's involvement in this incident, although the court's opinion was expressed that Russia then had control over the Donetsk People's Republic "" NARRATIVE: The Hague Court recognized that Russia was not involved in the downing of the MH17 plane in 2014.
CONTEXT: The Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down on July 17, 2014 in the territory controlled by the separatists in the Donetsk region. All 298 people on board were killed. Most were citizens of the Netherlands. A joint international investigation, with representatives of the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, concluded in 2021 that the plane was shot down by a Russian-made Buk missile belonging to the 53rd Air Defense Brigade of the armed forces Russian from Kursk, near the border with Ukraine.
Since 2014, Russia has launched a series of false narratives about the downing of this plane. According to one version, the plane was shot by the Ukrainian army, assuming that President Vladimir Putin was on board. In Moscow, they stated that the missile is part of the 9M38 production series with which a military unit from the Ukrainian region of Ternopil was equipped. Moscow's representatives accused Ukraine of being involved in the downing of the plane and of falsifying the evidence.
OBJECTIVE: Manipulating public opinion and hiding the truth in Russian society about Moscow's involvement in the downing of the Malaysian plane.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, if we carefully read the Hague Court's verdict, published in English and Russian, we notice that the investigation presented a series of evidence regarding Russia's involvement in the downing of the aircraft. The actual text of the court decision dismantles the disinformation narrative launched by the Kremlin in most government media institutions. The president of the court, judge Hendrik Steenhuis, mentioned during the verdict that the Russian Federation had overall control over the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), which means that Moscow was responsible for that territory at the time of the downing of the plane.
It was mentioned that many separatist leaders had Russian citizenship or extensive experience in the army of the Russian Federation. ""Some DNR leaders had close ties with the Russian Federation. For example, the intercepted conversations often mention contacts with high dignitaries from the Russian Federation,"" said the judge. Hendrik Steenhuis also mentioned Russia's regular sending of weapons to the DNR and the training of the rebels. Moscow is also accused of naming the heads of the self-proclaimed bodies leadership of the DNR, coordinating the military activities directed against Ukraine.
One of these Russian-appointed leaders was Igor Girkin, a former colonel in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), who at the time of the downing of the plane was Minister of Defense and commander of the armed forces of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk.
According to the verdict, the ""Buk"" missile, which was of Russian manufacture, was brought from Russia to the Donetsk region, and after the air disaster - the installation was transported back to hide the evidence. In other words, the court's verdict shows the direct involvement of Russia in shooting down the plane Based on the preliminary investigation, in March 2022 Australia and the Netherlands officially accused Russia of shooting down the plane, their position being supported by the EU.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives about the downing of this plane, launched by the Russian government media in recent years. In July 2021, a false Kremlin narrative was launched, according to which Ukraine's fault for the downing of flight MH-17 continues to be hidden from the West. In August 2021, the Russian press indirectly accused Ukraine of shooting down the plane, mentioning that the Taliban are much more concerned with flight security than Ukraine. Publication / Media:

In reality, the issue of such a transfer of territories was not raised, and with regard to the deposit, the Republic of Moldova insistently demands, for decades, that the ammunition be transferred to Russia and the soldiers who guard it, withdrawn from its territory.
NEWS: ""In the Republic of Moldova, the possibility of transferring to Ukraine a part of its territory, where the warehouses with Russian military ammunition are located, is being publicly examined. The President of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, previously declared that she would be ready to share with her neighbors. The leader of the Social Democratic Party of Moldova, Victor Selin, told NG that Ukraine is running out of ammunition, and Moldova could agree to exchange military warehouses on a part of the Odessa region. According to him, the business would also suit Romania, which will be able to control the mouths of the Danube. Soon this will become the most urgent problem in the region, according to the politician""
NARRATIVE: The Republic of Moldova is ready to violate its status of neutrality and get involved in the war on the side of Ukraine, exchanging territories to give it access to a military depot
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Transnistria was attached to the former Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic during the USSR, in exchange regions from the south and north were handed over to Ukraine. With the disintegration of the USSR, Transnistria declared its independence, and in 1992 an armed conflict was reached. On the territory of the separatist enclave, supported by Moscow, there is also a military warehouse with approximately 20,000 tons of ammunition, guarded by a Russian military contingent. Its presence is considered one of the main impediments to the settlement of the frozen conflict in the region.
The Russian military presence in western Ukraine and the existence of a pro-Russian regime in the separatist region returned to the attention of the international community with the start of the war in Ukraine, and since then the idea of ​​a possible exchange of territories began to be promoted more intensively, a possibility that is not discussed official from Chisinau and Kiev. Also, some voices from Bucharest allude to territorial claims that Romania, as well as other states, could present to Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: To resume the accusations promoted by the propaganda from Moscow that the pro-European authorities from Chisinau are involved or are ready to be involved in the war in Ukraine on the side of Kiev. To bring back into discussion the subject of a possible exchange of territories between the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, in order to cause uncertainty and phobias among the population. Indirectly, to bring back into discussion the theses promoted by Moscow that Ukraine is not a national state.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: In 1992, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine signed the bilateral treaty in which they recognize each other's borders. However, the subject of a transfer of territories appears regularly in the Russian press or from Chisinau, apparently to incite the spirits, since there is no intention of Chisinau and Kiev regarding a possible exchange of territories.
Chisinau opts for the peaceful settlement of the Transnistrian conflict and considers the region part of the Republic of Moldova, as provided for in the Constitution, and the possibility of exchanging territories has never been discussed at the official level.
On the other hand, a former Minister of Defense from Chisinau, Vitalie Marinuta, told NG that the ammunition from Cobasna is out of use, but his statements are not taken into account by sm.news and eadaily.com.
The subject seems to be promoted by the Russian press and to refuel another thesis promoted by Moscow regarding the fact that Ukraine is not a national state and its neighbors would have the right to parts of its territory. This thesis is also used to reduce the sympathy and support of the international community for Ukraine in the context of its war of defense against Russia. Publication / Media:

At the same time, the spokesman of the Kremlin explained the decision of the Russian head of state not to participate in the G20 leaders' meeting by the fact that he is very busy and must be on the territory of Russia at the moment, with the people.
After the summit, at which the pressure on Russia increased, Moscow seemed more and more isolated and even its partners warned about the possible use of nuclear weapons, the Kremlin began to return to the classic propaganda narrative regarding the ""West"" terrorist"" who wants to destroy Russia and kill Putin. In reality, Putin's life was never put in danger during the multiple international meetings and summits, and the accusation against the West, which would resort to terrorist methods is totally unfounded. Most of the G20 member states have condemned terrorism in various international formats, some of them being involved in various international anti-terrorist actions during the last decades. At the same time, Western countries have themselves been the target of terrorist campaigns that have lasted for decades (note that, during the Cold War, some terrorist organizations that launched attacks in the West had links with/were supported by states from the former communist bloc, led by Moscow).
The pro-Kremlin political scientist Serghei Markov, systematically promoted by the Russian press, makes a single argument, claiming that the same secret services bombed Russia's gas pipelines, referring to Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 in the Baltic Sea. They were damaged by four explosions and the Swedish investigators even found traces of explosives on the spot, but for now it is not known who could have caused them. Russia claimed, without providing any evidence, that it was an operation by the British naval forces. On the other hand, Western experts pointed out that the damage to the pipelines also benefits Moscow, which is trying to force the West to stop supporting Ukraine by means of the energy weapon - stopping or reducing natural gas supplies.
The narrative regarding Russia's support of Ukraine by launching the war and destroying the energy system is devoid of any logic. Serghei Markov repeats the thesis of the Russian propaganda, according to which the special military operation aims to save Ukraine. The political scientist adds, absolutely cynically, that the destruction of the Ukrainian energy system takes place ""out of love"". In reality, the attempt to destroy the morale of a population through fear, leaving it in the dark and cold, represents exactly the definition of terrorism.
The international community has also condemned the repeated attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, and a spokesman for the EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy Josep Borrell, Peter Stano, declared that Russia's actions appear to be ""war crimes"". , and those who are guilty of them must ""account"". On October 13, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) designated Russia as a terrorist state by adopting a resolution entitled ""Continued escalation in Russian aggression against Ukraine"".

She argues her thesis by citing a single far-right politician.
NEWS: ""In recent months, the standard of living in France has dropped critically, and the assistance given to Ukraine at the expense of the country causes dissatisfaction among the French. This opinion was expressed by a French politician, the leader of the Popular Republican Union party, Francois Asselineau, quoted by RIA Novosti.
On his Twitter account, he asked a simple, but very widespread question, if the sanctions against Russia are worth continuing?
It should be noted that the French regularly criticize the authorities for the policy of sanctions. The president is also criticized. The French are sure that the leader must take into account first of all the interests of the citizens of his country"".
NARRATIVE: The French reject the policy of sanctions against Russia and the assistance granted to Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media built this propaganda narrative based on a classic method of generalizing the opinion of a pro-Kremlin politician to all citizens of a state. Francois Asselineau is quoted, who is a far-right politician, a supporter of the Putin regime, but also a follower of France's exit from the EU and NATO.
The Republican People's Union Party has never had members in parliament or local councils, and Francois Asselineau was voted in the 2017 presidential elections by only 0.92% of voters. After this failure, he did not participate in the presidential elections of 2022. His point of view and that of his party is not representative of French society. This politician distributed various false narratives of the Kremlin on his Twitter account, writing, for example, in October that Zelensky is the author of a genocide against Russian speakers and criticizing Macron for supporting ""a Nazi regime"".
Starting from these opinions of Asselineau, close to the pro-Kremlin narratives, the Russian press wrote that all the French criticize the authorities and do not understand why the anti-Russian sanctions are continued and why Ukraine enjoys support. In reality, one of the electoral messages of President Emmanuel Macron, re-elected this year, was the support of Ukraine and the non-allowance of the expansion of the war launched by Russia. Also, according to a survey published at the end of September, 62% of the French support the policy of sanctions against Russia in the context of the war in Ukraine.
The thesis that governments should do more for their citizens than for Ukrainians is not new; In fact, Veridica identified her in the first days of the war in an online campaign against Ukrainian refugees that took place in the Republic of Moldova.
Veridica also dismantled a series of false narratives that aimed to manipulate public opinion and present positions critical of Russia as supporting and solidarity with it. In July, Russian propaganda ""proves"" that American scientists support Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. In October, the Russian press wrote that foreign diplomats are withdrawing from Kiev for fear of a Russian offensive. Various fake news about the Government in Kiev were also launched , who expressed his distrust in the partners from the West, or about the terrorists trained in the EU, who will act against civilians in Donbass.

The American elections, Russian trolls and ""Putin's chef""
nytimes.com / 6 and 10 Nov. 2022, politico.eu / Nov. 7 2022
A few weeks before the November 8 election, the FBI and the American Agency for Cyber ​​Security warned about the reactivation of Russian trolls and bots in the context of the partial elections. The warning, picked up by the New York Times, comes after the resumption of online activity after a year of silence by the user of the conservative social media platform Gab who posts under the name ""Nora Berka"". Most of the posts are derogatory, some even obscene, and target President Joe Biden and other prominent Democrats. The comments deplore the use of American taxpayer money to aid Ukraine in its war with Russian invaders and describe President Zelensky in caricatured terms borrowed from Kremlin propaganda. Russian interference in US elections - doggedly denied by Moscow for years - was publicly recognized last week by one of Vladimir Putin's close associates. The Politico publication cites the oligarch Sergei Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group involved in the front line of the so-called ""special operations"", who admitted on his account on the Vkontakte network that Russia ""has interfered, is interfering and will interfere"" in American politics, adding that it will do it ""carefully, precisely and surgically"" in its own way, as it knows.
Nicknamed ""Putin's cook"", Prigojin is on the list of those sanctioned by the United States and the European Union, with Washington offering a $10 million reward for information related to his involvement in influencing the American elections.
Iranian disinformation about US election rigging.
apnews. com / Nov 7 2022
On the eve of last week's elections, several American users shared on social networks a video intended to highlight the vulnerability of the American electoral process to foreign ""hackers"". one of the speakers projects a film from his laptop that he claims to have received from an Iranian whistleblower and which would demonstrate how he and his compatriots ""hacked"" the database of the American military abroad, using the stolen information to falsify some ballot papers in the 2020 elections. ""This is how elections are stolen"" - commented one of the users, being rewarded with thousands of likes and redistributions before the post was restricted on Twitter. According to the Associated Press agency, which cites the results of a joint investigation of the US Department of Justice and the FBI in 2021, the images presented at the event in Florida are actually a deceptive simulation and not proof of a successful vote fraud operation. The investigation since then concluded that two Iranian citizens created and disseminated a video with alleged vulnerabilities of the electoral infrastructure, with the claim that it depicts an operation to falsify the votes of Americans outside the country. In 2020, hackers compromised electoral websites in 11 states and downloaded the data of over 100,000 voters, but did not use the data to falsify votes.
""Fraud"" of the American elections, added edition
politifact.com / 7 - 10 Nov. 2022, bbc.com/ 10 Nov. 2022
The partial elections in the United States were for the followers of the former president Donald Trump a good opportunity to refresh the conspiracy theories of 2020 and to update the equally unfounded accusations of electoral fraud. The American site politifact.com, specialized in denunciation of fakes, analyzed and dismantled in less than three days over 20 untrue or misleading statements coming especially from the Republican camp. BBC journalists focused on some of the most obvious mystifications promoted on social networks and in the overseas press. The first concerns the alleged ""rigging"" of the vote in Maricopa County in the state of Arizona, where the process was slowed down because 20% of the voting machines could not scan the code on the ballots due to the poor quality of the printing. Despite the official explanations of to the electoral officials, Donald Trump had a vehement reaction on his own social media platform called ""Truth social"", warning his supporters that they are trying to ""steal the elections with faulty devices"". Trump's accusation, immediately taken up by Kari Lake, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, did not influence the voting process, with authorities instructing voters on an alternative procedure. from Wisconsin marks the ballots. The conclusion of the posts was that the images proved vote falsification. In reality, the official was conscientiously fulfilling a legal formality, visually verifying the correctness and checking the name of the polling station. Among the forgeries that circulated in 2020 and were resurrected at last week's election, the BBC mentions the one known as ""Sharpiegate"" - i.e. the alleged cancellation of ballots written with permanent Sharpie markers, faces prohibited because the cough penetrates from one side of the paper to another. The misleading statement, started in Illinois and promoted by the right-wing publication ""The Gateway Pundit"", was contradicted by the local election authority, which stated that permanent ink pens are preferable, and ballot paper of voting is one meant to prevent impregnation.
Police officer sentenced to prison for a false post
euronews.com / Nov. 9 2022
The Euronews television channel announces a first regarding the sanctioning of the manufacture and distribution of forgeries online: a Spanish policeman was sentenced to 15 months in prison and the payment of a fine of 1,620 euros after in a post he falsely accused an immigrant of committing very serious facts. A member of the Catalan Civil Guard, the officer posted a video on Twitter in 2019 of a man hitting a woman and leaving her unconscious, claiming that the aggressor was an unattended Moroccan minor and that the woman had been raped in the town of Canet del Mar. In reality, the clip - which has gathered almost 30,000 views, was an older footage from China. The policeman shared the clip a few days after a woman from the same locality was allegedly raped by two foreign minors at a Reception Center. The prosecutors pointed out before the court in Barcelona that the policeman had previously posted racist and xenophobic messages, inciting hatred against foreigners and that he had deliberately distributed the shocking images with a profound disregard for the truth. After the trial, the Civil Guard announced that it would begin disciplinary proceedings against the policeman, whose identity was not made public. The date of publishing:

147,649,"NATO stole Romania's National Day, leaving the country without an army at the same time","Romania is left without an army, the defense of the homeland is at the mercy of NATO, this being the last step in the loss of independence.",False,[],"['NATO', 'Romania', 'National Day']",,,,,,,https://www.national.ro/social/romania-nu-mai-are-armata-pe-1-decembrie-defileaza-militarii-straini-din-nato-780080.html,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-nato-a-furat-sarbatoarea-nationala-a-romaniei-lasand-in-acelasi-timp-tara-fara-armata,,16.11.2022,,,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-nato-a-furat-sarbatoarea-nationala-a-romaniei-lasand-in-acelasi-timp-tara-fara-armata,,"The military conflict near the country's borders brought the discussion about Romania's defensive capabilities back into focus, and with the approach of the celebration of Romania's National Day, sovereignist propaganda returned to the discourse announcing the systematic loss of state independence, symbolized this time by the fact that only foreign soldiers would participate in the December 1st parade. In reality, units of the partner armies are constantly invited to the parade, not only from NATO, but even from the ex-Soviet space.
NEWS: ""The military parade on Romania's National Day will no longer be Romania's. MApN decided to invite 600 foreign soldiers from NATO, to march in place of the Romanian Army. The representatives of the reserve officers say that it is a mockery of the citizens and that this means that Romania no longer has an army, being also a clear signal that the territory of our country has been made available to NATO.""
NARRATIVE: Left without resources, capital, labor and independent justice, Romania lost the last bastion of sovereignty, the army.
CONTEXT: Since the days preceding the Russian invasion in Ukraine, several disinformations regarding the Romanian army (it is preparing for war, mobilizing its reservists), as well as false narratives related to the defensive capabilities of the Romanian state (it has a weak army) have been released into the public space , equipped with outdated equipment, etc.). Their intensification is, in fact, meant to discredit NATO and undermine confidence in it. Most of them were dismantled, in an interview for Veridica, by the head of the Directorate of Information and Public Relations of the MApN, Brigadier General Constantin Spinu. The information under discussion now is no exception, being just another piece in the disinformation puzzle originating in Moscow.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting sovereignist and anti-Western discourse, undermining trust in NATO.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The December 1st military parade is a constant in the events that Romania celebrates its National Day, with the exception of 2020, when, due to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, it was cancelled. With the accession to NATO and the signing of other treaties and bilateral military partnerships, along with the Romanian armed forces, foreign soldiers also participate in the parade, in an approach based on reciprocity. It is obvious, however, that the number of soldiers participating in the parades of other countries is lower than that of the foreign soldiers who parade in Romania, because we are talking about the comparison between the forces generated by several states and the forces of a single country. The fact that ""we no longer have troops"" is obviously false information, currently the Romanian army numbers approximately 75,000 active soldiers, to which is added a number of approximately 55,000 paramilitaries (mainly gendarmes), and the military forces in reserve are estimated to 50,000 people. The statement ""[...] Americans, French, Poles and those who are still in the country, that there are more than us"" is equally absurd, the number of foreign soldiers present on the territory of Romania being no greater than 5,000 people, and this in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. Before February 24, there were approximately 3,300 foreign soldiers in Romania. Poland, one of the states preferred as an example of independence by nationalist propaganda, hosted 10,500 foreign soldiers, but this fact did not seem to destroy Polish sovereignty at all in the eyes of Romanian patriots. Last but not least, the Government Decision referred to in the article under discussion approves the invitation of a maximum of 600 people who will be part of the military detachments of NATO member states and partners. It is quite clear, we appreciate, that the imposition of a limit does not imply reaching it. And, since we are still talking about hundreds of people, we have as an example the parade from 2019, in which 500 soldiers from 21 allied or partner states participated. It is true, however, that at that time, not faced with either the pandemic or the war, the nationalist propaganda had somewhat lost its momentum: in the absence of Russian aggression, three years ago there was no question that ""we became a visible target for the Russians"" and neither that the parade some NATO soldiers in Romania would represent a challenge for Moscow.
Regarding the status of ""territory occupied"" by NATO forces, here we are dealing with a thesis promoted intensively by Russian and pro-Russian propaganda and it is a direct continuation of the Cold War theses regarding the usurping and exploiting West. Romania is the one that requested to be accepted in NATO and made the commitment that, as a member, to accept and adopt the common rules for all member states. Although the military and political strength of Romania is not as great as that of the majority of member states (which can translate into less influence at the NATO level) it is, legally, a member that has exactly the same rights and obligations as the others. It can be argued that, once it enters NATO, all countries have ceded part of their territory to the NATO armies, but this is a voluntary act and not the consequence of a territorial invasion.

In reality, both the Ukrainian army and the leaders from Kiev were greeted as liberators, and with the departure of the Russians, information regarding war crimes committed by them began to appear.
NEWS: ""The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, visited the city of Kherson. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are preparing to execute by shooting the civilians in the city. [...] This became possible after the Russian troops regrouped on the left bank of the Dnieper.
Ukraine will start actions to clean up civilians in Kherson, said the deputy governor of the Kherson region, Ekaterina Gubariova. She mentioned that the inhabitants of the city of Kherson should not visit the center because of this danger. Previously, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Maria Zaharova, stated that there will be executions and massacres of civilians"".
NARRATIVE: Volodymyr Zelensky visited Kherson to launch the massacre of civilians.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Kherson on November 14, after this city was liberated by the Ukrainian army following the withdrawal of Russian troops on the left bank of the Dnieper.
Zelenskiy posted on his Telegram channel various information about the situation in Kherson, mentioning the progress made for the supply of electricity, the restoration of Ukrainian mobile telephony, the provision of medical assistance. From the neighboring region, Mikolaev, 25 tons of food products, 3 tons of hygiene products and an ambulance were brought to Kherson. The President of Ukraine thanked the Ukrainian military for having managed to bring normalcy to this city in the south of Ukraine. In liberated Kherson there was no water, no electricity, no internet. Social networks were flooded with images about how the Ukrainian army was received by the citizens. Information also appeared about how Russian forces behaved with civilians, and the international press wrote how Russian soldiers could enter homes at any time, stealing, kidnapping or torturing.
In Kherson, pits with corpses of civilians were discovered, as well as real torture centers, used by the occupying army to destroy the resistance of the inhabitants, who protested against the occupation from the very beginning. Therefore, the Ukrainian army did not come to execute the population, as Russian propaganda says, but to save it from Russia's war crimes.
Ekaterina Gubariova, presented by the Russian press as a deputy governor of the Kherson region, does not represent the legitimate Ukrainian authorities, but an occupation body created by the Kremlin and legitimized in the internal Russian legislation by the act of annexation, signed by Vladimir Putin on September 30.
Gubariova would have forbidden the inhabitants of Kherson to visit the city center in order not to be executed by firing squad, a fact confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
In reality, Ekaterina Gubariova has no control over the city, and her message is addressed especially to the domestic Russian public to demonstrate that there is a certain communication between the occupation authorities, called legitimate, and the residents.
Veridica showed, in a dialogue with a Ukrainian military man of Romanian origin, that the Kiev troops are seen by civilians as liberating forces, and in the localities where the Russian troops were driven out, life is returning to normal, the changes being felt over the course of several weeks.
Also, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the pro-Kremlin media, which aimed to demonstrate that Ukraine is massacring Russian speakers in the east and south of Ukraine. The Russian press wrote in June that the Ukrainian army is massacring Russian-speakers in Donbass, after in May, according to false narratives launched by Moscow, Kiev developed a plan to organize a genocide of civilians in Kharkiv. Russian propaganda kept trying to prove to public opinion that the news about the massacres committed by the Russian military are not true. In April, the Russian press wrote that the Ukrainian army is bringing corpses to Lisiansk to stage a new massacre, after reporting that the murders in Izium or Bucea were fabrications.

The false narrative is picked up by Politnavigator, a website affiliated with the Kremlin.
NEWS: ""Deploying their troops in Romania, the Americans are thinking first of all about an attack on Transnistria, whose supply lines have been cut, said political scientist Marat Basirov in an interview with the ""Vashi Novosti"" channel
""This scenario aims to occupy Transnistria. We have armed forces there, but there are several thousand and they do not have access to the supply routes"".
[...] ,,According to him, first of all we will want to solve the energy problems.
""The only power plant in Transnistria supplies energy to this republic (Transnistria) and Moldova. That is, they bring the army to Romania intending to solve the transport, energy and military problems. If we had conquered Odessa, everything would have been simple""
NARRATIVE: The United States is preparing an attack on Russian/pro-Russian forces in Transnistria.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Narratives regarding the danger posed by NATO, the most important defensive military organization, for the Russian Federation have been among the most frequently invoked by Russian propaganda lately. This is also one of the reasons why Russia claims to have attacked Ukraine.
In recent months, Russian propaganda, but also politicians and the pro-Russian press from Chisinau have launched several falsehoods about the Republic of Moldova's approach to NATO, the massing of Romanian military troops in the Republic of Moldova or plans to attack Transnistria by the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and /or NATO/Romania.
The new narrative, in which the main target becomes the Cuciurgan Power Plant, is launched in the context in which this structure, controlled by a Russian company and the Transnistrian separatist authorities, stopped the supply of electricity to the Republic of Moldova (right bank) after Gazprom reduced the volume of natural gas.
OBJECTIVE: To further fuel the idea of ​​the danger that NATO presents to Russia/the Russian world and thus to justify the war launched by the Kremlin against Ukraine.
 
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Marat Basirov, the one who promotes theses about NATO preparations to attack Transnistria, is the political scientist who in February talked about a war that should have started in 2023-2024. It refers to the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army, recently located in Romania. Its purpose is to fortify NATO's eastern flank in the context of Russia's war in Ukraine and it has no war missions.
NATO leaders have repeatedly declared that they are ready to defend the member states, including Romania, in case of attacks from Russia, but they have specified that they do not intend to attack Russia directly.
Also, the authorities from Chisinau have repeatedly stated that they do not intend to attack the separatist region in the east of the country and continue to opt for the identification of a peaceful solution, even if officials from Kiev have stated several times that the Ukrainian army could eliminate very easily the military and paramilitary structures on the left side of the Dniester.
The thesis related to the attack on the Cuciurgan Power Plant seems even less likely given that its destruction would also leave the right bank of the Dniester without energy. Even if it no longer supplies electricity, the energy that the Republic of Moldova imports from Romania still passes through the respective plant
TRUTH: Elements of the US Army's 101st Airborne Division, nicknamed ""The Screaming Eagles"", were sent to Romania to support NATO's eastern flank. Publication / Media:

According to the section dedicated to Agriculture on the website of the Brussels Commission, in the week preceding the minister's statement, the price in Romania for 100 kg of class S pork carcass - i.e. the one with more than 60% meat - was exceeded only by the prices in France, Portugal , Slovenia, Finland and Sweden. For class E, pork from Romania was cheaper only than that from Bulgaria, Cyprus, Portugal, Finland and Sweden. In conclusion, Minister Daea's statement is false. Romanian pork is one of the most expensive in Europe, by no means the cheapest.
The online operation ""Romanians, called to the army""
misreport.ro / Nov. 1 2022
In the morning of October 11, a network of at least 34 Facebook pages managed from Romania by anonymous owners published the same deliberately false message, at intervals that varied between 2 and 25 seconds. It is the spectacular finding of the complex investigation carried out by the misreport.ro portal, specialized in debunking fake news. The identical text, transmitted to a cumulative audience of ten million users, announces the convocation of thousands of Romanians into the army, in the context of the war in Ukraine. The pages that spread the fake have banal names, are apparently intended for Romanians in the diaspora and regularly offer the same mixture of traditional recipes, baby remedies and morning greetings like ""good morning at cafeluta"", between which they insert material with false and alarmist content. at misreport they discovered that all the posts were accompanied in the first comment by a link to the website usd24.ro, the same one that - as proved by a Recorder investigation from 2018 - took over and distributed the content in Romanian of the Kremlin-controlled publication Sputnik and banned today in the European Union. The domain usd24.ro is registered in the name of Liviu Besleaga, former vice-president of the Coalition for the Modernization of Romania led by the controversial Alexandru Cumpanasu. According to the information on his Facebook account, Besleaga is currently the president of the National Committee of the Republicans Romanian-Americans and president of the Romanian-Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Victor Ciutacu's comment on the RTV show:
""Entire convoys were hit by high-precision missiles in the war in Ukraine. Mr. Harnagea, Mr. Dobritoiu, I'm not good at these military things, but...""
Corneliu Dobritoiu and Catalin Harnagea, the experts invited to comment on the images of the alleged bombing of an armored convoy in Ukraine, were in the past at the head of the Ministry of Defense and respectively of the Foreign Intelligence Service, essential institutions of the national defense system.

Russian intoxication about Ukrainian ""stages"".
observers.france24.com / 1 Nov. 2022
Since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin's propaganda has been trying to convince that the video testimonies of their own atrocities are just fakes with which the Ukrainians are trying to sensitize public opinion. Such an accusation distributed on TikTok, debunked by the creators of the ""Observers"" show of the public channel France24, uses as evidence of the alleged Ukrainian staging images of a film crew at work in the city of Gostomel, bombed by the Russians. In reality, as also show the photos on the Instagram page of the production company, it is about the team of the filmmakers of the documentary film ""The Land of Heroes"", which describes the drama lived under occupation by the residents of Bucea, Irpin and Gostomel. Another example is the online accusation brought against the American actor Sean Penn that he was involved as a director in the falsification of a scene full of drama, filmed in Ukraine. In fact, the images, available on YouTube, were filmed in 2013 in Birmingham for the British action film ""Invasion Planet Earth"". - he would lament in front of Western cameras. In reality, the soldier is an actor who appears in the music video for the song ""Lullaby"" performed by the Ukrainian singer Anna Khanina.
Anti-Ukrainian lies attributed to respectable TV stations
reuters.com / October 31, 2022; verificat.afp.com / Nov. 3 2022
A video announcing the auction in Germany of some Russian works of art in order to help Ukraine has gathered thousands of views on the Facebook and Twitter networks, as well as on the platform of conspiracy theorists BitChute. The auction, later proven to be unreal, involved the sale of paintings and manuscripts by Russian artists, with the objects to be destroyed in public, and the collected money to be donated to the Ukrainian army. For credibility, the images imitated the logo of the Euronews channel, and the organization of the auction was attributed to the prestigious company Bolland & Marotz. Both the French television station and the Bremen auction house denied any connection with the alleged charity event. A fake look-alike distributed online in several languages ​​was dismantled by journalists from France Presse. It is a cartoon in which a pig with Nazi insignia personifies Ukraine - a repetition of one of the favorite themes of Russian propaganda regarding the nazification of Ukraine. The clip, which was distributed and appreciated including by pro-Russian Romanian users, bears the acronym of the Israeli television channel INN, but the logo differs. The management of the Israel National News station categorically denied that it produced or distributed the filmed material. The journalists discovered that the same clip was posted on October 12 on the Telegram channel entitled ""INN: Ukrinazism"", which publishes in Hebrew right-wing content in general, usually targeting the United States and Ukraine, and which uses a logo similar to the one attached to the clip .

In reality, such a draft law is not registered or discussed in Ukraine, the information being an invention of Russian propaganda.
NEWS: ""The draft law on the association of Poland and the Lviv region will be signed by the end of this year. ""It is a historical moment awaited for so long by our peoples, who were separated by the criminal Soviet regime. Poland will come to Ukrainian lands not as an occupier, but as a brother and ally. It will be a convenient collaboration for both parties that will generate economic development of Ukraine and will demonstrate to the whole world that it does not matter who owns the territory, but the prosperity and development of the people who live there is important,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky.
NARRATIVE: Zelenski will cede the Lviv region to Poland.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The news about the annexation of the Lviv region to Poland by the end of the year was published not only by the pro-Kremlin press, but also by some Telegram and YouTube channels. In reality, in the register of draft laws that will be examined or that have been adopted, we do not find such an initiative.
Moreover, the words of President Volodymyr Zelensky, which illustrate the news, are not taken out of context, as Russian propaganda often does, but are simply invented. At no bilateral meeting with representatives of the Polish state did the president of Ukraine speak about any union or association.
At the same time, on September 16, a law came into force that offers Polish citizens in Ukraine additional social, legal and economic guarantees. As a sign of gratitude for supporting Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees during the war, Kiev decided that Polish citizens can engage in work and stay on the territory of Ukraine for 18 months. The law says nothing about territorial changes, the association of some Ukrainian regions with Poland, etc. The false narrative about the annexation of the Lviv region to Warsaw appeared 2 weeks after the entry into force of this law, adopted by the Kyiv Parliament in July.
Also, Poland amended its legislation in March to offer as many opportunities as possible to Ukrainian refugees to integrate into the social and economic structure of Polish society.
The propaganda narrative was launched after the Russian state media published the news about the organization of a referendum on joining Poland in the Lviv region, fabricating information about the ballots stamped by the Polish authorities and Zelenski's promise to allow the annexation.
Poland became a target of Russian propaganda because it was the most vocal of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. Warsaw's actions are determined not least by the fear that Poland will be the next target of Russian aggression. According to a sociological survey, 74% of Poles believe that Russia could attack Poland in the near future.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding Poland's ""desire"" to annex Ukrainian territories. In addition to the false information about the referendum in Lviv, the Russian media also wrote that Warsaw will start a war against Moscow in the next 10 years , while the majority of Poles support the invasion of the western regions of Ukraine. Poland has been accused of wanting to take over its ""historical territories"" from Ukraine, using the weakening of the Ukrainian state. According to Russian propaganda, the President of Poland admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories, and Kiev would have allowed 10 thousand soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country.

In reality, there is no such government order, both producers have ongoing contracts, which must be honored.
NEWS: ""The population and the economic environment in Romania were sacrificed for the sake of Maia Sandu. Hidroelectrica and Nuclearelectrica no longer sell energy in the market, not even for next year, they received orders from the Government to reserve the entire amount for the Republic of Moldova. In this context, President Maia Sandu urged the Romanians to save energy so that it reaches the Republic of Moldova. Someone said that, for how many billions of lei the Republic of Moldova received from us, not even a thank you was heard from the officials across the Prut. Furthermore, President Maia Sandu came to Romania not to thank for the help, but to ask for more energy and, above all, to ask us to save energy, so that we can give it to the Moldovans. It's just our obligation. It is certain that the visit achieved its goal. And now the energy suddenly disappeared from the market, and the state companies were ordered to reserve it for the neighboring country.""
NARRATIVE: The Romanians will not have electricity in the winter because of the Moldovans.
CONTEXT: The Republic of Moldova, a country without its own energy resources, is completely dependent on imports of fossil fuels and electricity. Before the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the Moldovan state buys its electricity from Ukraine (about 30% of what is needed) and the rest from the Cuciurgan power plant, located on the left bank of the Dniester, on the territory of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria. In October, the Russian bombings mainly targeted the Ukrainian energy infrastructure and, for this reason, Ukraine's exports to the European Union and Moldova were stopped. That's why the Chisinau government had to buy the entire amount of electricity needed from the Transnistrian plant, which is under the exclusive control of Russia. The separatist leaders from Tiraspol, encouraged by the Kremlin, took full advantage of this situation and, from November 1, stopped electricity deliveries to the right bank of the Dniester, blackmailing Moldova to receive more gas. The bailout comes under the conditions that the Transnistrian region has not paid for the gas consumed in the last 31 years, accumulating a debt of over 8 billion dollars. In this context, the reaction of our country was a prompt one, and the Moldovan electricity needs are provided, at this moment, in a proportion of 90%, by Romanian companies. At the same time, the Bucharest government also approved aid for the supply of fuel oil and firewood. At the same time, through diplomatic channels, Romanian officials are appealing to the international community to grant grants to the Republic of Moldova so that it can buy energy on the free market.
OBJECTIVE: Weakening Romanians' trust in the authorities, inducing the feeling of fear that they will freeze in their houses in winter, enmity between the two Romanian countries on the banks of the Prut.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The article appeared on a well-known website promoting fake news (many similar to those promoted by Moscow) does not provide even an official source or a document attesting that the Romanian government ordered that the production of Hydroelectric and Nuclear to be reserved exclusively for Moldova. At this moment, Moldova buys electricity from Romania, from OMV Petrom and Nuclearelectrica. There are contacts for signing a contract with yet another Romanian producer, but this does not imply exclusivity conditions at all, the producers being involved, obviously, in other contracts already signed and in progress. There is, indeed, an article in Ordinance 138/2022, which obliges all electricity producers in Romania to sell energy to suppliers and traders from the Republic of Moldova at a capped price, but it does not refer to certain producers nor does it oblige them for them to reserve the entire production for export across the Prut, but only ""within the limit of the available quantities"". Moreover, the respective article invokes exceptional situations caused by the war in Ukraine and refers exclusively to the needs of Moldovan final consumers. In support of the presented ideas, the material in the discussion, he also invokes a statement by the executive director of the Romanian Energy Suppliers Association, Ion Lungu, who states that the suppliers are complaining that they no longer have anywhere to buy energy and that, on the wholesale market, no more transactions are made. in fact, the statement of the director of AFEER says the same things that the president of AFEER, Laurentiu Urluescu, said on October 14, so more than two weeks before the outbreak of the crisis in Moldova. The statements invoke the very bad legislation (n.r. - in the opinion of AFEER members) that currently regulates the energy market in Romania, unrelated to the situation in Moldova. Probably unnoticed by the author of the article on national.ro, there is even in Ion Lungu's statement a remark that confirms the fact that there is absolutely no government provision related to the exclusive reservation of electricity production for the Moldovan state: ""And then the producers, which are state companies, wait, lest they be forced by the Government to give to the Republic of Moldova and have nowhere to turn.""
On a different note, speculating on a personal note, we cannot fail to note the enormous chance that has now appeared for Moldova to definitively escape its energy dependence on Russia and the Kremlin's political blackmail, together with the rest of Europe. Romanian-Moldovan diplomatic efforts are starting to give more than encouraging results. Already, Prime Minister Ciuca declared that Romania can give the Republic of Moldova 5 million cubic meters of gas per day, more than enough for the consumption across the Prut, including during the winter, but at the moment no official act has been signed in this sense. The United States will provide financial aid to the Chisinau authorities for connecting the key elements of the Moldovan energy sector to the European systems, as well as for attracting investments in local production. And the president of the European Commission, Ursula von de Leyen, announced that the European Union will help Moldova ""to face its immediate needs of gas and electricity"". Also, there is already a project financed by the United Nations Development Program , intended, among other things, to create and strengthen effective mechanisms for addressing and preventing the risks caused by the recent energy crisis and other potentially future ones. The divorce of Moldovans from Russia will not be easy, but it has begun. The first step is to get through this winter with good, together. Publication / Media:

NEWS: According to some diplomatic sources, the Russian gas received (by the Republic of Moldova) is sold on other markets.
In total, according to some sources, Moldovagaz could have hidden approximately 140 million cubic meters of gas. From November 1, after the amount of gas delivered to Transnistria was reduced, these volumes could have increased. Part of the stolen gas is stored in warehouses on the territory of Ukraine, as well as in the Iasi-Chisinau gas pipeline.
There is an assumption that Moldovagaz sells gas to Ukraine at the market price, violating the provisions of the Moldovan-Russian contract that prohibits re-export to third countries""
NARRATIVE: The Republic of Moldova steals natural gas destined for Transnistria and sells it to Ukraine, violating the contract with Gazprom and endangering the lives of the residents (including Russians) of the separatist region.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is facing a complex energy crisis, deepened with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Being dependent on imported energy resources and having citizens with the lowest purchasing power in Europe, the increase in prices for this category of products affected the Republic of Moldova both economically and socially. Since the beginning of the year, gasoline has become more expensive by approximately 30%, and diesel by 60%, while the tariffs for gas and electricity have increased several times.
Starting this autumn, in addition to high prices, the Republic of Moldova is also facing a gas and electricity deficit. From October 1st, Gazprom started to deliver only 70% of the gas volume stipulated in the contract, and from November it covers only about half. Since October 11, Ukraine has stopped exporting electricity. Until then, the Republic of Moldova imported approximately 30% of consumption from this market. From November 1, the Cuciurgan Power Plant, located in the separatist region on the left side of the Dniester, but which belongs to a Russian company, suspended electricity deliveries to the right of the Dniester. The plant covered 70% of the energy requirement.
Most of the electricity needed is currently provided by Romania, but the price has increased, so that since November the rates have been increased again.
After the separatist authorities in Transnistria stopped the supply of electricity, the Republic of Moldova reduced the volume of gas for the left bank of the Dniester, and Tiraspol complained to Moscow.
At the end of October, the representatives of Chisinau and Tiraspol had a round of discussions focused on the energy issue, but without much results, as the Deputy Prime Minister for Reintegration, Oleg Serebrian, later commented.
OBJECTIVE: To inoculate the idea that the government in Chisinau makes money at the expense of Russian citizens from Transnistria, violating the provisions of the contract with Gazprom.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: Even if Moldovagaz has reduced the volume of gas for the left bank of the Dniester, the remaining amount covers only 80% of what is needed, so that Chisinau was forced to procure over 150 million cubic meters of gas, which he stored them in Romania and Ukraine. It is logical, as an official from the Ministry of Infrastructure and Regional Development told Radio Moldova, that the Republic of Moldova does not sell, since it has to buy.
Also, the director of Moldovagaz, Vadim Ceban, stated that on the one hand the company does not have the right to sell gas on the foreign market, and on the other hand the quantities of gas that the Republic of Moldova stores in Ukraine cannot be used by it for the needs its. ""Moldovagaz, first of all, cannot sell to anyone outside the domestic market, according to the contract with Gazprom. The gas that is now stored in Ukraine, in the underground warehouses, is the property of Energocom and will be able to be used in case of emergency, but all operators are governed by European rules, which prohibit the use of gas quantities for their own purposes"", explained Vadim Ceban .

In reality, Belarus is not targeted by any foreign power, but it has allowed Russia to use its territory for aggression against Ukraine.
NEWS: ""Every day we hear absurd ideas from the NATO generals, the US leadership and learn about various dangerous plans of the fascist junta in Poland. Belarus is a target of the North Atlantic Alliance and the Polish secret services [...] Aleksandr Lukasenko has declared more than once that he will not allow anyone to occupy the territory of his state. Therefore, the founding of the joint military group is a correct and necessary tactical decision.
[...]
We are not even talking about the Nazi rebels and mercenaries within the Ukrainian army [...] NATO's nuclear exercises represent a challenge for the entire civilized and free world. Therefore, anticipating the events, Aleksandr Lukasenko builds a system of measures to prevent such a scenario.
Unfortunately, we have to admit that our southern neighbor, Ukraine, has become unpredictable, dangerous from the point of view of military illegality and the irresponsible behavior of its leadership. Probably, many have already asked themselves several times how long Ukraine will exist and if such a state (with all the attributes of statehood) still exists today? The answer is not easy. But I believe that Ukraine, which we have known for many decades as a peaceful and creative country, has turned into a terrorist mechanism that causes self-destruction [...]
The alliance with Russia makes us look with confidence towards tomorrow. The president is doing everything possible to prevent the West from initiating a military confrontation with our state"".
NARRATIVES: 1. NATO wants to go to war with Belarus. 2. Poland is a fascist state, and Ukraine - a Nazi state. 3. Belarus must collaborate with Russia to defend itself against Ukrainian terrorism.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In reality, neither NATO, nor Poland, nor Ukraine want to enter into a military conflict with Belarus. This propaganda message resumes the meta-narrative according to which the ""Russian world"" is surrounded by the ""collective West"", which wants to destroy it. In the article initially published on ""Belarus Segodnya"" it is said that Ukraine is a dangerous, unstable and terrorist state, without mentioning the fact that Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, financed and supported the war in Donbass, and on February 24 invaded the Ukrainian state, an action condemned by the international community.
141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted in March this year. a resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine and that it is a terrorist state.
Therefore, Ukraine is not an aggressive, terrorist or unstable state, but a state that defends itself from the military aggression of a neighbor supported by Belarus. The territory of Belarus has been used since the beginning of the war to launch attacks with ground forces as well as for bombings, which indicates a direct involvement in the war of the Belarusian political leadership, considered illegitimate by a large part of the members of the international community after the fraud of the election results presidential elections of 2020.
The article in the Belarusian press is signed by the head of the sociology department of the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, doctor of philosophy, Nikolai Scepkin, with the aim of giving more credibility to the official narrative.
Continuing the Kremlin's propaganda messages from recent years, the Belarusian press writes that Ukraine and Poland are Nazi/fascist, but without providing any proof. As in the case of Moscow, the propaganda talks about Nazism in general terms.
In reality, in Ukraine any public manifestation of communist or Nazi ideology has been prohibited by law since 2015, and far-right formations have never been in government, obtaining low scores in elections. For Moscow, everything that does not coincide with the ideology of the ""Russian world"" is a Nazi, a narrative taken over by Minsk.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Warsaw has been accused by Moscow of supporting Kiev's defensive efforts, with a series of fake news being released regarding Poland's true intentions in this war. The Belarusian press writes that Poland is a state led by a ""fascist junta"" that dreams of attacking Belarus, after the Russian press wrote that Poland will start a war against Russia in the next 10 years and will occupy western Ukraine in a few months.
In reality, Poland helped both Ukraine and the Ukrainian refugees on its territory. Right from the first days of the war, the leadership of Poland declared that Russia must be stopped now, because, otherwise, the war could expand. In September, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki declared that the EU must prepare for a possible extension of the war, because Moscow is dominated by the idea of ​​occupying other states.
The creation of the Russia-Belarus joint military group has nothing to do with NATO exercises. Russia wants to involve the Belarusian army in the conflict, but, for now, without much success, probably because of the opposition of the Belarusian society to this idea.
Annually, NATO organizes nuclear deterrence exercises. The exercise ""Steadfast Noon"" involved 14 members of the NATO Alliance and aircraft with nuclear capability, along with additional capabilities. The Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, declared that it is a routine exercise, which takes place every year: The fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear deterrence has always been peacekeeping, prevention and deterrence of aggression.""

""All the unemployed in Ukraine will be sent to the front"", writes the former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mikola Azarov from the time of the pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in a post on Twitter, quoted by the pro-Kremlin press and Telegram channels in Russia.
NARRATIVE: The unemployed from Ukraine will be enlisted in the army and sent to the front
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Starting from a post on Twitter by the ex-pro-Russian Prime Minister of Ukraine Mikola Azarov, who fled to Russia after the outbreak of the military conflict in Donbass and the annexation of Crimea in 2014, pro-Kremlin media and Telegram channels from Russia distributed a false narrative about sending unemployed Ukrainians to the front.
If Azarov tries to convince the public opinion that the unemployed will be sent to the front by the Ukrainian Government, the press writes that ""for now"" they will be enlisted in the ""Recovery Army"", implying that they will be sent to the conflict zone later.
The propaganda narrative exploits to the maximum the name of the Ukrainian government project ""Recovery Army"", which is not a military unit. The Ukrainian Minister of Economy, Yulia Sviridenko, even emphasized that it is a non-military structure: ""At the moment we have two armies in the country - the first defends the country on the front, and the other - works"". The Ukrainian governor emphasized that no one will be forced to participate in this project, and those who will work will benefit from remuneration at the level of the minimum wage in the economy.
Taking into account the manipulations launched by the pro-Kremlin press on this topic, most of the Regional Military Administrations in Ukraine have published on their official pages explanations regarding the functioning of this governmental project. Therefore, the Ternopil Regional Administration writes that in Sumi people will take care of cleaning the riverbeds and repairs in various buildings, and in Chernihiv - the redevelopment of landfills and the repair of social spaces. These regions are far from the front area, and the works described are not military activities. According to the Government's explanations, participation in the ""Recovery Army"" is not mandatory, and by Article 43 of the Constitution of Ukraine, forced labor is prohibited even under the conditions of marital law.

Pravda.ru: the resigned Dincu, the model of Romanian ""patriots"".
pravda.ru / Oct. 24 2022; primatv.ro / Oct. 8 2022; pressone.ro / 24 Oct. 2022
The Russian website Pravda is among the few foreign publications that mourn the resignation of Vasile Dincu from the position of Minister of Defense. After emphasizing the reason cited in the text of the resignation - namely the impossibility of the PSD politician's collaboration with the president Klaus Iohannis - the Russian journalists are trying to convince that a good part of the Romanian military would support the conciliatory position of Dancu, in contradiction with the attitude of the Supreme Commander of the Army , willing to fight ""to the last novel"" with Russia. It all started - writes Pravda - with the televised interview in which Dincu proposed that the United States and NATO negotiate peace with Russia over Ukraine's head, in contradiction to the official position of Bucharest according to which the decision of the negotiations belongs to Kiev and the discussions will not call into question the sovereignty of the Ukrainian territory. As proof of the support that Dincu's position would enjoy among the military, the Pravda article quotes from the pressone.ro publication some of the ideas of a lieutenant -anonymous reserve colonel, considered an exponent of ""Romanian patriots"": the civilian population of Donbas is the victim of Kiev's aggressive actions, Ukraine has never been Romania's friend, Stephen the Great's Moldova borders Russia and Poland - so Ukraine has no historical legitimacy, the eastern regions of Ukraine are populated only by Russians, just as Bessarabia, Odessa and Chernivtsi are populated by Romanians. What the Russian journalists avoid saying is that the much-lauded opinions of the Romanian reservist were presented by the press as an example of the spread of disinformation and fake news in Romania by the sympathizers of the AUR party, which includes the retired military man.
The Kremlin's propaganda echoes in the Romanian press
evz.ro / October 25, 2022; mediafax.ro / 25 Oct. 2022
The favorite publication of the Romanian reservist praised by the Russians from Pravda is, according to his words quoted by pressone.ro, Evenimentul zilei. Not by chance, since the Romanian newspaper, like the Moscow one, shares the opinion of the resigned Minister of Defense regarding the resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. In a podcast dedicated to the retirement of Vasile Dincu from the head of the Ministry of Defense, the journalist Ion Cristoiu explains the gesture of resignation - comparable in seriousness, in his opinion, to a hypothetical resignation of the Russian Minister of Defense - by the PSD politician's refusal to be complicit in,, the irresponsible adventure into which Klaus Iohannis wants to drag Romania"". For Ion Cristoiu, Romania is already in a state of war, and the current military situation is comparable to that of June 1941, before the invasion of Russia by the Nazis with the support of the Romanian army. -a logic similar to the one promoted by the Kremlin, the journalist believes that all those who insist on the territorial integrity of Ukraine are in fact partisans of the war, unlike those like Vasile Dincu, who would have disturbed President Iohannis by talking ""about peace"" under the conditions of Moscow. Concerned about the political future of Vasile Dincu, Ion Cristoiu foresees the possibility of the coagulation of a group of those willing to accept Russia's territorial claims.
Ion Cristoiu: If it is not possible to associate with the ""Marga group""...
Ionut Cristache, journalist: From where? Yes, the Transylvania area...
Ion Cristoiu: He's a good man (Andrei Marga)... I read it now in (,,Trecerea la ) Prostocratie"", I was really envious of Marga. The problem with Marga is that she doesn't have a group. I mean, unless.. It can't go with AUR... That means it needs a grouping, however...
The height of manipulation: Russian propagandist accused of being a C.I.A. agent.
rt.ru / Oct. 24 2022, polygraph.info / Oct. 25 2022
Anton Krasovschi, the director of the Russian-language programs of the Russia Today propaganda office, scandalized even his bosses after he suggested while interviewing the writer Sergey Lukyanenko the physical liquidation of all Ukrainian children who say their country is invaded by Russia .
Sergey Lukianenko, Russian writer
""I went to Ukraine for the first time in the 80s, when I was a child. The children there told me that Ukraine is occupied by the Muscals, that if it weren't for the Muscals, they would be living like in France and that they are suffering under the occupation. They were not Ukrainian-speaking children (...) They were Russian and Russian-speaking.""
Anton Krasovschi, RT journalist: ""They should have been taken to the river and drowned!"" Right where the ducks swim!""
The slippage of Krasovschi, who during the interview also urged the burning alive of Ukrainian children, proved excessive even for his bosses, otherwise very permissive when it comes to war propaganda. Even if the journalist later apologized, the editor-in-chief of Russia Today suspended him, following which he will be investigated by a special commission. Paradoxically, a former adviser to Vladimir Putin blamed the United States for the journalist's calls for genocide. Sergey Markov wrote on his Telegram account that Krasovschi acted at the behest of the American secret services, which ""desperately"" needed arguments to accuse Russia of preparing a nuclear attack on Ukraine.
Russian lies about Ukrainian ""dirty bombs"".
truthorfake.france24.com / October 27, 2022
Meanwhile, Kremlin propaganda is trying to validate the idea that Ukraine is preparing to use so-called ""dirty bombs"" - explosive devices containing both radioactive material and conventional explosives. In Moscow, the theory was presented by the head of the Biological, Chemical and Russia's nukes. General Igor Kirilov used as arguments several images and graphics, claiming to come from Ukraine. However, journalists from france24.com discovered that most of them are either fake, or wrongly attributed or located. For example, instead of the Nuclear Research Institute in Kiev, indicated by the Russians as being involved in the design of the alleged Ukrainian weapons, there appears a photo that the Russian news agency TASS presented last year as being of the most powerful neutron source in the world, located in Russia, at St. Petersburg. Similarly, the manufacturing process of Ukrainian ""dirty bombs"" is illustrated with an image published in 2010 by the Slovenian Agency for Radioactive Materials. The journalists also found that a third image, intended to convince about the danger of radiation generated by the bombs planned by the Ukrainians, is actually a capture from a video on which Russian propaganda was used during the war in Syria.
Senator Sosoaca and the ""chemical gifts"" in the Parliament
factual.ro / October 27, 2022
Diana Iovanovici-Sosoaca resumes an older conspiracy theory, this time from the rostrum of the Parliament. On October 12, the senator addressed a questioning from the Parliament's podium on the topic of the ""chemical trails"" left behind by airplanes, suggesting that they could prove the start of a new pandemic.
Diana Iovanovici-Sosoaca, unaffiliated senator
""On October 6, 2022, the population was worried about the numerous lights that appeared in the sky of Romania, known as Chemtrails. The thousands of photos published on Facebook by thousands of users from all over the country, during the whole day, are proof. The problem is that many people have complained of respiratory problems, stinging eyes, fatigue after the appearance of these symptoms. Another problem is that, although people saw or video recorded the movement of these planes in the sky above them, on the air traffic tracking applications, Flightradar24, Airtraffic, Airnav, Radarbox, there were no planes present within a radius of 50-100 km around them or they were outside the usual flight lanes"".
The senator's assertion that the streaks visible in the sky could not be ordinary traces of condensation left by airplanes, on the grounds that they would disintegrate almost instantly, was dismantled by the website factual.ro, which consulted a specialist. Scientific researcher Bogdan Antonescu explained that the duration of visibility of condensation traces depends on atmospheric humidity. They disappear in a few minutes if the air is dry or, as NASA found, they can stay in the sky for up to 14 hours in case of high humidity.

In reality, such methods are illegal on the territory of Ukraine and Russia is the one that forcibly recruits soldiers to cover its losses.
NEWS: ""Until October 30, bring a friend and you will receive a cash prize of 20 thousand hryvnias."" Help your state now. The marketing experts of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine invented a ""brilliant"" promotional contest to betray friends in the interests of the Armed Forces"", writes Podolyaka, the information being distributed by a Twitter account that praises Russia's actions on the territory of Ukraine, but also by the channel by Telegram ""Military Observatory"".
""The Ukrainian army is gradually and irreversibly turning into a financial pyramid, but it is an atypical one, composed of the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers. This is how oxen are taken to the slaughterhouse, sold for good money"", writes Glav.su.
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian army gives money to those who trick their friends into enlisting.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there were no such ""offers"" or ""promotional contests"" at the level of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Russian press, Telegram and Twitter channels cite the official pages of the Ukrainian army, but without including hyperlinks. There is no such announcement, presented in the form of a video clip by Russian propaganda, on any official page of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Armed Forces or relevant departments. Therefore, the information about the monetary prizes offered to people who bring their friends to the military commissariat is an invention of the Russian press, because the announcement cannot be found on the official pages of the Ministry of Defense or the Ukrainian army, and the Russian press does not present any evidence. Once again, false citation is used as a method of creating propaganda messages, to which the Russian government press increasingly resorts in the last months of the war.
The process of military recruitment or mobilization during martial law is described in small details by Ukrainian legislation, and the offering of monetary prizes or any other relations of this kind between the military commissariat and citizens are illegal. There is no legal mechanism for offering prizes or remuneration in the context of the general mobilization determined by the war. Art. 15 of the 1993 Mobilization Law describes the mobilization process. During mobilization, the enlisted person keeps his job and salary until mobilization. Those who must be mobilized, especially men between the ages of 18 and 60, and refuse to do so will be penalized and judged, according to the law.
The Center for Countering Disinformation, which works alongside the Government of Ukraine, wrote on its Telegram channel that Russia, through various propaganda messages, discredits the mobilization campaign in Ukraine, as it is a wider informational-psychological operation, the purpose of which is to discourage Ukrainian resistance in this war.
In addition, it is Russia that has been intensely criticized for the methods used to restore its forces decimated by the war - from the recruitment of prisoners among the Wagner mercenaries, to the forced mobilization, ""with the arcanum"", of thousands of people.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the mobilization process in Ukraine. In May, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine is mobilizing a million soldiers, paying with human beings for Western loans. Other propaganda narratives followed, according to which the EU will deport refugee men to Ukraine to be conscripted into the Ukrainian army, while volunteers enroll in pro-Russian battalions that will defend the country's southeastern regions from the Ukrainian army.

In reality, we cannot even talk about a real competition between the two ports, the port of Rotterdam being advantaged by its geographical position, work capacities and infrastructure.
NEWS: ""The scooterist press claims that the explanation with the port of Constanta is a conspiracy theory. Not true. We come back one more time. Rotterdam, if I'm not mistaken, which is their port, brings, I don't know, 10% of the GDP of the Netherlands. Why? Let's take an example: I want to send some products from Frankfurt, Germany, to Georgia, which is on the Black Sea. That's why I send them to Rotterdam, load them, when you load them you take a lot of money, and then hush-hush-hush through the Dardanelles, it arrives in the Black Sea. So it does that for about two weeks. When we enter Schengen , the entrance gate to Schengen is the port of Constanta. And then it is much simpler for the one from Frankfurt to send the goods to Constanta, which at some point goes to the Black Sea from this point of view. And then, it is a trick to the Dutch lobby, as we also have internally, the Dutch have a lobby, parenthesis: few people remember that before '89 the nest of Western spies was the ambassador of the Netherlands; we had been surrounded from an informational point of view, he went over everything; and it was for a long time after '90. This is one of the causes, Schengen no longer means customs."" (Ion Cristoiu, at the Marius Tuca show, from 23:50)
NARRATIVE: The Netherlands will not accept Romania in the Schengen area, because the port of Constanta will compete with the Dutch port of Rotterdam.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: Romania and Bulgaria should have been admitted to the Schengen area in March 2011, according to an agreement at the level of the European Union. However, the entry was postponed, the reasons cited by the opposing states being corruption and the lack of real justice reforms in the two countries. Mainly, Germany, Finland and Austria were the most vehement, but France and the Netherlands also showed some reluctance. Surprisingly, in the fall of 2011, the Netherlands accentuated its opposition, invoking, together with Finland, the danger of illegal immigration from Turkey through Bulgaria and Romania into the community space. Bucharest's diplomatic attempts to solve the problem did not have the expected success, and the position of the Netherlands remained unchanged.
Immediately, associating the information with the 2012 parliamentary elections, Vocea Rusiei launched in the Romanian media the theory of Dutch interests regarding the port of Constanta and their connection with the refusal to accept our country in Schengen. It was quickly taken over and disseminated by various politicians and maritime transport experts. It is enough to say that Vocea Rusiei is the former name of the Sputnik agency, Russia's main propaganda tool and fake news launcher, so that we have a clear picture of the veracity of the arguments that make up this theory. Since then, it reappears sporadically in the news streams, whenever the sovereignist propaganda runs out of current topics.
In the context of the war in Ukraine and amplified by the increase in European solidarity against the background of the resulting crisis, Romania's chances of joining Schengen have increased considerably. The leaders of Germany and France, as well as the institutions in Brussels, explicitly support this, the only still hesitant opinion being that of the Netherlands. As a result, the Rotterdam-Constanta topic was brought back into the public space by Ion Cristoiu in a series of statements made in the online broadcasts of some journalists at least as controversial as him.
OBJECTIVE: Weakening public opinion's trust in the European Union, undermining European solidarity, inducing the idea that the West considers us to be inferior citizens and that for equal rights we will have to give up sovereignty and economic independence.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: An objective analysis to reveal the possible advantages of one of the ports over the other must take into account not only the geographical position, but also aspects of the port infrastructure, the land network of access roads and, not in lastly, the socio-economic and political situation of the analyzed areas. Currently, Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe, the amount of goods passing through the Dutch port being greater than the combined amounts of the next two, Antwerp and Hamburg. The Port of Constanta is rather an isolated port, any maritime transport in connection with it having to pass through two straits, which implies higher costs and delivery times, as well as some size limitations. It is becoming more and more irrelevant in trade relations with Asia and especially China for two reasons:

The new Silk Road is becoming a reality every day that excludes a maritime route through the Black Sea. For several years, a freight train has been running directly between the east coast of China and London, passing through Rotterdam and Hamburg as well. Moreover, the land transport infrastructure (railways and highways) in Central and Western Europe is much more developed than in Romania, where transport from Constanta Port to the west represents an eternal problem. However, we must mention that, in the current context, crossing the Russian-Ukrainian war zone by land can become problematic.
Although not without controversy, the acquisition by the Chinese of the port of Piraeus brought a new regional hub to the forefront of commercial routes. Compared to the investments and profits registered by the Chinese in Greece, it is expected that their interest will not increase at all in the sense of relocating some of the operations to the Black Sea. Much closer to the exit of the Asian commercial route to the Mediterranean, Piraeus has real chances to become perhaps the most important Mediterranean port, a fact that will lead to the diminishing and thus declining role of the port of Constanta.

In addition to the geographical disadvantage, Constanta also faces technological, bureaucratic or financial problems. The port of Rotterdam is fully automated, being from this point of view the most technologically advanced port in the world. In contrast to this, the technological level of the port of Constanta not only stagnates, but seems to decrease with the passage of time. The lack of equipment is felt to the full when it comes to activities related to the port, such as sanitary-veterinary inspections. If in other European countries, through whose ports goods from outside the EU are transited, an analysis takes a few hours, in Romania it can take several days. In addition, the access fees in the Romanian port are huge, probably justified only by the large number of salaries that must be paid to the employees. Their number is almost equal to that of the employees of the port of Rotterdam, with a volume of activity more than 25 times higher in favor of the Dutch.
The truth about the Dutch hesitations regarding Romania's accession to Schengen essentially lies in the internal policy of the Dutch government. More concretely, it is related to the fragility of the majority on which the government led by Mark Rutte is supported in the parliament. Invested almost 300 days after the legislative elections, the current government relies on a coalition made up of four parties. Among them, the Christian Union, a conservative party, which has only 9 members in parliament, 5 deputies out of 150 and 4 senators out of 75. This political formation is strongly opposed to immigration, especially to Islamic immigration from Central Asia and the Middle East. Fearing that the borders of the Schengen area will no longer be as well secured as before, this party is blackmailing the governing coalition with the breaking of the protocol, in case, in Brussels, the Netherlands will vote for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. Last but not least, our country's accession will not be possible without Bulgaria's, for both political and strictly geographical reasons. Unfortunately, our southern neighbors do not seem to be as ready for accession, which is why, regardless of Romania's situation, for the moment, the Schengen area stops at Nadlac customs.

The narratives are false given that, on the one hand, Romania has no territorial claims, and on the other hand, Russia is now mired in Ukraine and does not have the strength to change the borders of the states as it pleases.
NEWS: Russia will not agree to the union of Romania and Moldova, but will return Bessarabia under its wing, together with Transnistria, said the expert from the Institute of CIS Countries, Igor Siskin, in an interview given to the YouTube channel ""Vnuki.info"" .
""Moldovans are our fraternal Orthodox people. And we have no reason to give it to the Romanians. [...] The entire former principality of Moldova should gain independence and unite in a single Moldovan state,"" said Siskin.
It is certain that in case of union with Moldova, Romania will want to take over not only Transnistria, but also Odessa. Instead, the expert proposes the annexation of the Romanian city of Iasi to Moldova.
""Iasi is an old Moldavian city. And the Romanian boot has nothing to do there,"" said Siskin.
NARRATIVES: 1. Moldovans and Romanians are different peoples. 2. Romania is an aggressor state with territorial claims. 3. Russia can reshape the regional map as it pleases.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova appeared on the world map in 1991, when it proclaimed its independence from the USSR. Until 1812, when it was annexed by the Tsarist Empire, the territory between the Prut and the Dniester was part of the medieval Moldavian Country. From 1918 to 1940 it was part of Romania, but the USSR occupied the territory in 1940 and formed the SSR, with borders other than those of the former Bessarabia.
The territorial claims that Romania would have for the Republic of Moldova and several regions of Ukraine that were part of Bessarabia represent one of the most promoted theses by the Kremlin and pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau, despite the fact that Bucharest recognized independence and the sovereignty of the two states and offers political and financial support to Ukraine in the war launched by Russia; as far as the Republic of Moldova is concerned, Romania has constantly supported it, even when political formations with a Moldovan and even anti-Romanian rhetoric were in power.
Another thesis promoted both during the Soviet period and after the collapse of the USSR, is the existence of two distinct peoples - the Moldavians and the Romanians, who speak two different languages. The union of the two Romanian principalities in 1859 is presented as an annexation of the Country of Moldova and it is suggested that the Republic of Moldova would have the right to claim Moldova on the right of the Prut.
OBJECTIVE: To present Romania as an aggressor state and, at the same time, Russia, which got bogged down in the war in Ukraine, as a strong country, a regional leader, which can bring order to this part of the continent.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The thesis of Moldovanism, which appeared during the Tsarist Empire and was intensively promoted during the Soviet period, represented one of the elements of propaganda intended to justify the annexation of a part of the territory inhabited by ethnic Romanians.
Romania was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Moldova and even if over the years there have always been discussions about a possible union, this topic is not officially discussed either in Bucharest or in Chisinau.
In parallel with these theses, through the statements about the role of Russia and the possibility that Moscow can change the borders as it pleases, the idea of ​​the military and political power of the Kremlin in the region is promoted, against the background of the failures on the battlefield in Ukraine. Romania is a NATO member state and any attack on its territorial integrity would provoke a common response from the Alliance, however, it is very unlikely that Russia, which is not making progress in the war with a non-aligned military state, would risk a confrontation with the strongest alliance military around the globe.

""Romanians have been protesting for many years, but I have never seen anything like this before. I have never seen such great intolerance. People are against the redeployment of NATO troops on their territory. Here came the reply of the population. They started with slogans like ""we are not a bridgehead"", ""we can no longer feed Ukraine"", ""shame"" etc. and ended with street clashes. The authorities hid the truth about this event, nowhere was said about this protest"", informed a reader of the Telegram channel ""War Correspondents of the Russian Spring"".
NARRATIVE: Romanians protest en masse against NATO and the support policy for Ukraine.
CONTEXT: In recent years, the Russian government press promoted a series of false narratives about the desire of the peoples of Eastern Europe to leave NATO and the EU. The Russian press wrote that after joining the European and Euro-Atlantic structures, the Romanian state became poor, depopulated, controlled by Washington or Brussels, and the political elite from Bucharest makes decisions against the will of the people. These narratives have a double purpose: on the one hand, to show public opinion in Russia that the rapprochement with the West is a real catastrophe, and on the other hand, to sow Euroscepticism in Romanian society. After the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 a.c. the anti-NATO narratives are closely related to the anti-Ukrainian ones. NATO states are criticized for supporting Ukraine's defensive efforts, supplying it with weapons, ammunition, equipment and humanitarian aid.
OBJECTIVE: To show that NATO does not enjoy support in Romania and the citizens want the exit from the Alliance. To induce the idea that Ukraine does not enjoy support.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Demonstrations are a constant in Romanian public life. Only in the last decade have there been anti-austerity demonstrations, in 2012, to block exploitation in Rosia Montana, against corruption after the Colectiv tragedy, protests against GEO 13 or, during the pandemic, against the measures taken to stop the spread of Covid -19 etc. For several weeks, another wave of rallies and protests has been recorded. Some protesters demanded higher salaries and better working conditions, others requested the complete delimitation, diplomatically and economically, of Romania by the Russian Federation in the context of the invasion of Ukraine. There have also been protests by those dissatisfied with the ever-increasing energy prices or solidarity marches with the women of Iran. However, there were no significant anti-NATO or anti-Ukraine demonstrations; and if there were protests, their magnitude was so small that they went unnoticed by the press or the public. The clips posted by the Russian press or Telegram channels do not include any evidence of when they were filmed, representing a fragment of a protest, most likely in Bucharest, but without including evidence of the existence of anti-NATO or anti-Ukraine slogans. In fact, video footage can be used to illustrate any propaganda narrative.
The news was picked up by some portals from the Republic of Moldova, which published the video clip, citing ""a series of international publications"". In fact, only one source is cited - the online newspaper Pravda from Russia.
Moreover, the news is based on a comment by an anonymous reader who stated that the protests have a large scale, with great intolerance and that ""he has never seen anything like this"". At the same time, no one knows, according to to the Russian press, about these protests because the central press ignored them at the request of the authorities. From this it appears that there was an unprecedentedly large protest in Romania against NATO and Bucharest's policy of supporting Ukraine, with street clashes, but no one heard of him!
Another publication, the Ghall portal, publishes this news, illustrating it with two photos from the Bucharest protests in 2018. One of the photos clearly shows ""Down with PSD"". The pro-Kremlin publication Regnum writes about the protests in Romania, publishing a photo of protesters on the streets of Bucharest, in which some have umbrellas, and it is snowing outside. At least until the date of publication of this information, it did not snow in Bucharest, and the autumn turned out to be quite warm and without significant precipitation. The newspaper Izvestia de in Moscow he wrote about the anti-NATO protests in Bucharest, illustrating the information with a video report, but not from Romania, but from Germany. If in the text it is said about Romanians' dissatisfaction with the position in the context of the war in Ukraine, the video clip, taken from REN TV Moscow, reports about another protest in Berlin. Therefore, no Russian source has any evidence to prove that such protests took place in Romania.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian government media regarding the EU, NATO or the policy of some member states of these organizations. In June, the Russian press wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace. In May, Russian propaganda distributed information about the EU's fear of tuberculosis originating from NATO laboratories in Ukraine. In April, the pro-Kremlin press accused Ukraine of wanting to join NATO in order to attack Russia. Russian propaganda tries to convince the public opinion that half of the soldiers of the Ukrainian army are foreigners, which means that NATO is participating in the war. Publication / Media:

Demystifying Zelensky's hologram
observers.france24.com / October 11, 2022
Several Facebook and Twitter accounts with pro-Russian activity, including that of the Russian embassy in London, shared a clip accompanied by photos of Volodymyr Zelensky in front of a green screen, intended to authenticate the idea that the video interventions of the Ukrainian president are filmed in a super-technological studio and not in the heart of important events, as claimed. Moreover, some users claimed that the images prove that Zelenski has left his country and is sending his recorded messages from Poland. The journalists of the Observers show from the France 24 channel discovered that the clip that has gathered hundreds of thousands of views contains sequences from a video available on YouTube from June 16, when the president of Ukraine recorded his message in the form of a hologram to the participants of a series of European conferences dedicated to high technology. France 24 recalls that Zelenski's extremely popular video appearances have been criticized by pro-Kremlin propagandists since March, the first month of the invasion of Ukraine.
The false supremacy of BMW in European polices
digi24.ro / Oct. 17 2022, commons.wikimedia.org / police cars by country
Suspicions regarding the fairness of the auction through which the Romanian Police will buy 600 BMW cars continue to shake the political scene, however cloudy. PNL MEP Rares Bogdan felt obliged to reject the criticism addressed to his party colleague at the head of the Ministry of Interior with an at least casual statement. He told the Digi 24 station that ""in Europe, all the national police have cars bought from BMW"". The former journalist went further, saying that 90% of the police cars and motorcycles in France are manufactured by the German manufacturer. Beyond the controversies related to the costs and the technical specifications of the tender specifications, the argument invoked is false. According to the section dedicated to the brands of police cars in the Wikimedia Commons archive, the European police forces registered as having BMW cars are - in addition to the German police - the from Belgium, Norway, Italy, the Czech Republic, Poland, Great Britain, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, which means less than a quarter of the states of the continent. Admitting that the cited source would have omitted, by mistake, the possible presence of the German brand in the car park of the French national police, the percentage of 90% attributed by the politician to the BMW brand is totally unrealistic. As indicated by several specialized websites, the police in Hexagon is mainly based on the domestic brands Renault, Peugeot and Citroen, to which is added the Dacia Duster, manufactured by Renault in Romania. The confusion is amplified by the mixing in the same sentence of the Romanian politician of the motorcycles with the supposed BMW vehicles used with predilection by the French policemen. An irrelevant mention in the context, since the Bavarian manufacturer has been, for decades, a European leader in the motorcycle field, so specific. In fact, before being part of the equipment of the Romanian Police, BMW motorcycles were in the possession of the Communist Militia.
A Russian propagandist proposes bombing Romania
smotrim.ru / October 18, 2022
Vladimir Solovyov, one of Vladimir Putin's most active and influential propagandists, confused two Russian analysts invited to his show on the state television Rossia 1. Solovyov suggested Russia's bombing of military bases used by the West for helping Ukraine, including those from Romania: ""Perhaps the time has come to explain to those in the West, who are becoming more cheeky as we speak, that the bases in which they are currently training Ukrainians - those in France, Poland, Germany, Great Britain - maybe we should tell them that we consider the Polish airfields where planes land with the help of the USA and Great Britain, the bases in Romania and so on, to be legitimate targets. Don't you see now that, once again, they are expanding the range of action and the complexity of the weapons provided?"" Military expert Evgheni Bujinski tried to temper him, explaining that such an attack would practically mean declaring an open conflict with NATO: Well, I have already said that everything that enters Ukrainian territory is a legitimate target for us. But carrying out strikes on the territory of NATO member states means, of course, declaring war against them."" Not at all discouraged, Solovyov came up with the option of attacking the Polish airports of alleged ""partisan units"" located on the territory of Ukraine, including in the Kharkiv region, which the Russians did not manage to completely occupy: ""But the American missiles do not shy away from strike at Belgorod!"" Evgheni Bujinski: ""It's true, but...formally, the missiles are launched from the territory of Ukraine. It's a proxy war.""
The scenario of the denialists of civilian victims in Ukraine
dw.com / Oct. 18 2022
The rockets launched in the last weeks by the Russian army on Ukrainian cities were followed by the indispensable smoke screen of the Kremlin's propaganda. The supporters of Vladimir Putin contested the veracity of the victims of the intense bombing of Kiev on October 10, a soldier attack, according to the Ukrainian authorities, with 19 dead and over a hundred wounded. The conspiracists interpreted a short video distributed on social networks as proof of a Hollywood direction with actors mimicking suffering. The presence in the images of a woman who seems to be trying to take a selfie even though her head is bandaged and her clothes are covered in blood was the pretext for several malicious comments and accusations of staging. Deutsche Welle journalists identified the woman, Olexandra Kiseliova, in a hospital in Kiev. With wounds still visible, surgically stitched, she told how she was hit by the explosion when she was heading from her workplace to the shelter. Olexandra explained that she wanted to take a photo to convince her sister in Russia - who, by the way, is also talking about in the clip - of the Russian attacks on innocent Ukrainian civilians. The German journalists managed to talk to both the Associated Press correspondent, the author of the photos and the truncated distributed clip, as well as the military man in the images who provides first aid. Both confirmed that the images published with the victims of the bombing are real and provided details about the filming location, located near the office building where the German consulate in Kiev operates.
A Russian official tells the truth by mistake

An official of the Russian Ministry of Defense has publicly, involuntarily, confirmed a truth that both Moscow and Tehran stubbornly deny: the drones used to bombard Ukrainian cities are Iranian-made. While entering the set of a show on economic topics, Ruslan Puhov, the director of the Center for the Analysis of Strategies and Technology, without realizing that his microphone was open, was recorded asking the moderators not to insist on the topic of drones, which says that, although ""it is known that they are Iranian, the authorities do not recognize this"". Aware of the guest's blunder and embarrassed, the presenter continued with the prepared question.
TV presenter: ""How will the global market fundamentally change?"" Let's ask an expert. In the studio we have Ruslan Puhov, director of the Center for the Analysis of Strategies and Technologies and member of the Public Council of the Russian Ministry of Defense.

In reality, the politician's words were taken out of context, and Israel's refusal is determined by other reasons.
NEWS: Any weapon offered to Ukraine will end up in the hands of Iran, the former Prime Minister of Israel, who is currently the leader of the opposition, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in an interview for the American television channel MSNBC.
""As far as weapons are concerned, I do not rule out that it will happen as it has happened more than once - the offered weapons will end up in the hands of Iran and will be used against us,"" the politician declared.
Netanyahu commented on Israel's current policy of supporting Ukraine, calling it ""a wise one"". Israel now accepts refugees (but in a limited number) and offers humanitarian aid.
[...]
We remind you that Israel's Minister for Diaspora Affairs, Nachman Shai, wrote on Twitter that ""there is no doubt about Israel's choice to support one side of the conflict"", considering the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev.
NARRATIVE: Israel will not deliver weapons to Ukraine so that they are not stolen or sold to Iran.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, in the interview given to the American television station MSNBC by the former prime minister of Israel, Ukraine is not accused of stealing or selling weapons from the West. Russian propaganda linked two different theses from Benjamin Netanyahu's interview to prove that Kiev is a partner of distrust.
The Israeli politician analyzed Israel's traditional reluctance to supply weapons to other states. ""On the Golan Plateau, where we tried not to allow Iran to create a second Lebanese front against us, another second terrorist front, we found weapons produced by Israel"", argued Benjamin Netanyahu, showing when and from where appeared this reluctance for the first time, without referring to Ukraine.
Then, Netanyahu declared that the decision to provide weapons to Ukraine or any other state is very complicated and atypical for Israeli politicians. The Russian media added that Ukraine traditionally steals and sells western weapons, and Netanyahu would have confirmed this in this interview. Various Russian news portals such as Ruskaia vesna, Eurasia Daily, News.ru and others wrote that Netanyahu directly accused Ukraine of stealing and/or selling foreign weapons to other states, the statement being a propaganda invention. Moreover, the press headlines say that Israel accused Ukraine at the state level. However, Netanyahu does not represent the authorities of his state, being an opposition politician.
In another interview with USA Today, quoted by The Jerusalem Post, the former prime minister said that he will ""analyze"" whether or not Israel will supply weapons to Ukraine if he returns to power after the upcoming elections. He also said that he expects to he is asked to be a mediator for the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. ""If I become prime minister, it is assumed that this matter of mediation will come up again,"" he said.
In fact, Israel seemed quite close to making a decision to supply weapons to Ukraine. However, after the former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the number two in the Russian Security Council, warned Israel not to deliver weapons to Ukraine because this would ""destroy"" its relationship with Russia, an Israeli official refused. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz reiterated that the country will not supply weapons to Ukraine, despite a new official request from Kiev for air defense systems. ""Israel supports and stands with Ukraine, NATO and the West. That said, I would like to emphasize that Israel will not deliver weapons systems to Ukraine due to a series of operational considerations. We will continue to support Ukraine within our limits, as we have done in the past,"" said the minister. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Israel has an interest in maintaining good relations with Russia because Israeli air activity in Syria requires Russia's consent.
The suspicions regarding the relations between Ukraine and Iran are an invention of the Russian media in the context of the deterioration of the relations between the two states. The MFA in Kiev directly accused Iran of supporting Russia, which commits war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba requested the Western states to impose additional sanctions on Iran. According to the head of Ukrainian diplomacy, the Tehran regime supplied Iranian drones to Russia, ""while telling us that it is against the war and that it does not support any of the parties"". the current context of degraded bilateral relations seem disconnected from reality.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media that aimed to present Ukraine as a vulnerable, unstable and dangerous international partner. The Russian government press wrote that because of Kiev's propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated by Russia, not occupied, while American scholars support Putin's ideas about Ukraine. According to Russian propaganda, Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to seize part of Ukraine, and various mercenaries from Israel are fighting against Russia alongside the soldiers of the ""Azov"" group.

In reality, digital identity can be used to obtain various public and private services even now, and digital currency represents another form of existence of money.
NEWS: The Deputy Director General of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently explained how Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) can be programmed to determine what people will or cannot buy and insisted that they should be used together with a Chinese-style social credit system. Unlike cryptocurrency, which is private, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will be issued and controlled by the central banks themselves. In many ways, they will be the same as banknotes, but each transaction will be monitored to track compliance.""
NARRATIVE: The world occult will bring humanity under control by imposing digital currencies and digital identity.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The theory of total control of humanity by elites is not new. It is constantly adapted, depending on the ongoing events, sometimes the narratives even end up contradicting each other. Many of them are maintained, in recent years, by propaganda from Russia and amplified through social networks and media institutions that promote conservative themes and support radical movements and those of nationalists, sovereignists or anti-vaxxers. In order to better understand the success enjoyed by this policy of Russia, it is good to know that, during the Covid19 pandemic, for example, 66% of Romanians believed the conspiracy theories that promoted the connection between the pandemic and the ""world occult"". Theories of the related conspiracy talked about imposing control through the digital passport, inventing the Omicron strain to impose global dictatorship, or using vaccines for evil purposes.
As, at present, the energy crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine will ultimately lead to a financial crisis, the topic of individual finances has become for some time the main narrative promoted by conspiracy theorists. In mid-October, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference took place with the title: ""Digital currencies of central banks for financial inclusion: risks and benefits"". The well-known conspiracy site The Expose brought to the attention of the public its own interpretation of the speeches of the guests , and a translation of the article was published on activenews.ro, which wrote that, soon, we will be able to use our own money only if the government allows us and we will be able to buy only what we are allowed to. Activenews is one of the most famous sources of fake news in the Romanian online, over time Veridica dismantled several conspiracy theories promoted on this site, just as the international press did with the false narratives promoted by the British counterpart, The Expose.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing the idea among public opinion that advanced technology in the financial field and the introduction of digital currencies are aimed at controlling occult forces over people.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The dialogue at the conference mentioned above was focused on increasing financial inclusion globally with the help of digital currencies issued by central banks. Financial inclusion is a concept through which people and businesses can access payment services and other safe, efficient and convenient financial services. For this purpose, the digital currency issued by a central bank (Central Bank Digital Currency - CBDC) does not have the role of replacing cash, but of complementing it. In financial language, we are talking about an electronic form of money, complementary to the other existing forms (cash and bank accounts) used for making fast and safe payments. A digital currency is money of a central bank. This means that it would be supported by a central bank, which has the responsibility of maintaining the value of money, regardless of its form, physical or digital. In terms of financial inclusion, a digital currency means that those who do not have a bank account can have easier and safer access to money and cashless payments. CBDCs are more profitable than physical money, because they have lower transaction costs and transfer times. They also reduce printing costs, because instead of printing money, the central bank issues electronic coins. Moreover, banking operations with CBDC are available 24/7, as they are not limited by bank schedules.
Returning to the narrative of the total control imposed by the ""occult"" through local governments, we must agree that the election of the former deputy governor of the Central Bank of China and current deputy director of the IMF, the Chinese Bo Li, to exemplify the way the entire financial system works digitally, she was not the happiest. But what the Chinese official stated has absolutely nothing to do with violating the right to private life or restricting any freedom. Targeting payments for social assistance, consumption coupons, meal vouchers, vacation etc. is already a real fact. Even in Romania, thousands of social cards have been cancelled, because they were used for completely different purposes than the one for which they were issued. As a principle for allocating social funds, their exact direction to the destination and recipients established from the start cannot be something imputable to the authorities, even against it.
Another objection brought by conspiracy theorists to the new technologies is the verification of digital identity, considered essential for the functioning of CBDCs, especially in international transactions.
Digital identity already exists and is becoming more and more relevant with each new loyalty card registered for cheaper drugs and cigarettes, with each free pack of cigarettes accepted in exchange for a phone number, and with each engagement on social media. It is not imposed on us, we build it ourselves. Also, the use of behavioral models deduced by a computer following the analysis of financial transactions is not a new thing. For years, our activity has been analyzed in real time by increasingly intelligent algorithms, and data about us is stored to personalize online experiences. The transaction of said data to third parties would not be something new, unfortunately, it has already happened, at incredibly high levels. But behind these illegal and immoral practices are not some occult minds, but normal people who are usually caught and punished. Publication / Media:

Tirdea, in fact, repeats theses promoted more and more intensively by Russian propaganda and by pro-Moscow politicians from Chisinau.
NEWS: The Republic of Moldova is rapidly militarizing. The West, with the participation of Ukraine and Romania, involves it in military actions, which can lead to a civil war, resulting in the definitive loss of Transnistria and Gagauzia.
[...]
According to the deputy, many political scientists are already talking openly about the fact that Moldova is moving towards the approach and accession to NATO. The request could be submitted if the geopolitical and military situation on the territory of Ukraine changes in favor of Russia.
[...]
Referring to the effectiveness of protests against the government, Bogdan Tirdea mentioned that in a colonial regime, administered from the outside, ""there are zero chances for a legitimate change of power, early elections or the collapse of the system"". NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European governance of the Republic of Moldova, led by the West, establishes an authoritarian regime that will no longer be able to be removed by democratic means. 2. The West forces the Republic of Moldova to arm itself, including to get involved in the war in Ukraine. 3. The militarization of Moldova will lead to civil war and the separation of Transnistria and Gagauzia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is facing a deep economic crisis caused by the increase in prices, especially for energy resources, against the background of the war in Ukraine. The electorate and a good part of the political class in the Republic of Moldova have opted for years for the country's approach to the EU. Even after, due to corruption, some pro-European groups compromised, support for European integration remained strong. In the last presidential and parliamentary elections, Maia Sandu and the party formed by her, PAS, obtained, with a pro-European, pro-reform and anti-corruption speech, categorical victories, against the pro-Russian socialists, which was reacted to by - a wave of fake news and disinformation aimed at discrediting the pro-European option.
The attacks from the Russian media and the docile politicians of Moscow intensified with the outbreak of the war, among the main topics being those related to the proximity of the Republic of Moldova to NATO, the support it offers to Ukraine and even the intention to get involved in the war.
OBJECTIVE: To present the government from Chisinau as an undemocratic regime and involve the Republic of Moldova in the war against Russia. To justify possible pressures or attacks from Russia on the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Veridica has already explained that the so-called plans to attack the separatist region by the forces of Chisinau, at the command/with the support of the West, have no logic in the conditions in which representatives of Kiev, who consider the region as a possible factor of risk, even if small, considering its military potential, they expressed their readiness to ""cleanse"" it of separatists and Russian forces ""as soon as you snap your fingers"". A scenario of the regulation of the Transnistrian conflict following a military intervention is excluded by the Chisinau authorities, who continue to insist on negotiations.
Even if Ukraine showed itself ready to intervene in Transnistria, the opening of a new front would mean that it must mobilize the necessary resources for it in other areas of the country. In addition, the Republic of Moldova has a military budget of less than 40 million euros, Soviet armament, no tanks, fleet and anti-aircraft defense, so a minimal military potential.
The narratives regarding Western pressures for the Republic of Moldova to arm themselves for war are also false and have been thrown on the market repeatedly by Russian and pro-Russian sources; see for example here and here. Indeed, the problem of equipping the army of the Republic of Moldova was raised, but only because it was neglected for decades; neutrality does not exclude the existence of a strong army (see, for example, the case of Switzerland), and the Republic of Moldova does not even have the potential to become a considerable military force, given its population and its economic possibilities. Anyway, building a modern army takes years, regardless of the financial possibilities of a state, because it is not enough to purchase military equipment.
The accusations about the establishment of an authoritarian regime in Chisinau are part of another thesis promoted intensively recently by the media and Russian and pro-Russian politicians, who refer to the actions of the authorities during the protests that have recently taken place in the Republic of Moldova. It is about actions of the police (such as dismantling the protesters' tents) that resulted from the provision of the Commission for Exceptional Situations, under the conditions in which a state of emergency is declared in the Republic of Moldova. Paradoxically, the accusations regarding the intention of the authorities to no longer respect the electoral process were launched in the context in which they were confronted with demonstrations whose stated purpose was precisely the overthrow of the government through actions in the street - that is, exactly outside the usual electoral process. The next presidential elections would be held in the fall of 2024, and the parliamentary ones - in the summer of 2025. No one in Chisinau is discussing the cancellation of these elections and never, in the history of the Republic of Moldova, has it happened that the ruling party did not recognize election results and not to go to the opposition when he lost; this system worked even in the case of some regimes (Voronin, Plahotniuc) that were accused of trying to alter/corrupt/fraud the electoral process.
Regarding the danger of a civil war, in Transnistria there is, practically, a conflict that has not ended, but only passed from the phase of fighting, in which separatists supported by Russia fought with the forces of Chisinau, to a frozen one, but marked by regularity over time of an aggressive and threatening positioning of Tiraspol. After the armed phase of the conflict, Moldova never raised the issue of its resumption and went for the idea of ​​a peaceful reintegration, doubled by the withdrawal of the Russian army - which, however, refuses to leave the territory of the Republic of Moldova despite the commitments assumed. Moreover, the continuous presence of Russian forces on the left bank of the Dniester, but also the tacit support of Ukraine, at least until this country was invaded by Russia for the first time, in 2014, allowed Transnistria to resist as an entity outside the Republic of Moldova. Currently, the region is more economically linked than ever to the rest of the Republic of Moldova and the EU, and the isolation from Russia may lead to a greater willingness to discuss with Chisinau and accept a settlement of the situation. Consequently, the situation evolves in favor of Chisinau, which has no reason to seek a conflict. As far as Gagauzia is concerned, although the entity has threatened that in case of Euro-Atlantic integration it will separate from the Republic of Moldova, it is unlikely, given its size, but also the way in which it can be economically co-interested, that it can do this without the support and even the direct intervention of Russia. In addition, the hypothetical arming of the Republic of Moldova does not imply giving up the status of neutrality, which could be invoked by Russophiles as a pretext for unrest. Publication / Media:

In reality, Chisinau developed significantly during the period when it was part of Romania and was largely destroyed by the Red Army in 1941 and 1944, before being rebuilt in Soviet style.
NEWS: ""On October 14, Chisinau celebrated the day of the city. The capital of Moldova had several periods of development - from a provincial town during Pushkin's time, to a government center from the beginning of the 20th century, from a city almost completely destroyed by the Germans and a depopulated settlement, to a one of the largest industrial nodes of the Soviet Union. After the declaration of independence, Chisinau unfortunately lost many of the achievements of the previous generations. We would like to hope that, despite all the attempts and the anti-national course of the current government, the city will keep its status and regain its former greatness. We probably won't exaggerate if we say that the city of Chisinau owes its capital status to Russia [...]""
The publication also writes that ""the occupation of these lands by Romania once again turned Bessarabia into a foundation of a province, with the status of a colony, from where all resources were transported to the metropolis"", that ""during the Nazi occupation, the population of the capital decreased up to 25 thousand inhabitants"", that ""city development plans stopped with the proclamation of independence, and the ""freedom"" obtained turned into poverty and degradation"", that ""the European path promoted by the authorities is incompatible with development , but it relies on imports"" and that ""the change of power and the course of foreign policy would lead to true independence of Moldova and, respectively, to the industrial renaissance, development and flourishing of Chisinau"". NARRATIVES: 1. Chisinau developed only during the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union and degraded during the union with Romania and after the declaration of independence of the Republic of Moldova. 2. The European path of the Republic of Moldova is harmful to development, and Chisinau can regain its greatness only after the change of government.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the narratives is to present the periods of Russian/Soviet occupation as flourishing and beneficial for the development of Chisinau and at the same time to denigrate the periods in which it was part of Greater Romania, of the independence of the Republic of Moldova and its European course.
CONTEXT: The history of Chisinau is linked to Russia starting with 1812, when it annexed the eastern part, up to the Prut, of the Principality of Moldova. Chisinau then became the administrative capital of the Russian governorate of Bessarabia, being also used as a stationing point for Russian troops. On March 27, 1918, the Council of State decided on the Union of Bessarabia with Romania, and Chisinau was involved in an intense process of modernization according to Romanian patterns. During the interwar period, Chisinau became one of the great urban centers of Romania, with an intense cultural and economic life. With the Soviet occupation, Chisinau became the capital of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic and was rebuilt according to the Soviet model; since independence, the city has been the capital of the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Chisinau was named the administrative capital after the territorial seizure of 1812 and the annexation to the Russian Empire, but it was not until 1873, when Bessarabia became a governorate, that the city began to develop. Chisinau modernized especially thanks to the mayor Carol Schmidt, who led the city for 25 years, between 1877 and 1903, and radically changed its appearance, thanks to the collaboration with the architect Alexandru Bernardazzi.
Chisinau continued to develop very intensively during the interwar period, under the Romanian administration. Many comfortable houses, urban villas, buildings with apartments, very well designed schools were built in the city, libraries, printing houses, theaters were opened. It was also then that a series of businesses began to operate, the first mechanized mill, the bread and sausage factory, the candy factory, shoe, knitwear, fur factories, exhibitions of industrial goods and agricultural machinery were organized. In 1919, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry was founded in Chisinau, the banking sector began to develop, with the establishment of Banca Bessarabia. In 1921, the first airport was opened, and Chisinau was integrated into the road network of Romania. In 1918, the Popular University was founded, later the Faculty of Theology (1926) and the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences (1933). In 1919 the Unirea Conservatory was founded, in 1929 the National Conservatory was founded, and in 1936 the Municipal Conservatory. In Chisinau there is the National Theater, several cinemas, the Museum of History, a series of associations and cultural societies, dozens of Bessarabian newspapers and magazines appear. Under the Romanian administration, school was compulsory and by 1940 in Chisinau there were 50 primary schools, 11 high schools, three gymnasiums, the normal teachers' school, the diocesan school, the theological seminary, the accounting school, the military high school, the commercial high school, the girls' high school Princess Dadiani, Regina Maria Girls' High School, B.P. High School. Hasdeu, the Diocesan High School, the Industrial High School and others. During the Romanian period, the first democratic exercises took place - in 1919, at the first parliamentary elections, the city elected its representatives in the Romanian Parliament. Thus, the statement that ""the occupation of these lands by Romania once again transformed Bessarabia into a provincial foundation, with colony status"", is a false and manipulative one.
The publication claims that the city was rebuilt after the war and developed thanks to the Soviet Union, but omits to say that it was mostly destroyed by the retreating Soviet army in the summer of 1941, when the more buildings from the center of Chisinau by destruction battalions created by the NKVD. On the other hand, taking over the city during the war, for three years, the Romanian administration rebuilt a large part of the destroyed buildings. In June 1944, another episode of destruction followed, when Soviet bombers dropped tons of bombs on the city. Soviet propaganda accused the ""German-Romanian occupiers"" of destroying the city. After the war, the city was rebuilt in the Soviet style and few previously built buildings survived. In the context of communist planning, bulldozers destroyed many historic buildings that could be restored, on reason that they did not correspond to the Soviet plans.
The publication also writes that the city developed economically during the Soviet period, but all transformations in the economic sphere were accompanied by the denationalization of the native population and the modification of the ethnic structure of the city's population. in Chisinau, specialists from all corners of the USSR, but especially ethnic Russians, were brought to the state administration, party bodies, administration of the economic sectors. Russian language and culture were dominant in Soviet Chisinau. At the same time, all the goods produced were intended for the USSR, not for the local population. The purchasing power of the population was low, and the goods for daily use were in short supply. No good was owned by the people; including the housing stock in Chisinau belonged to the Soviet state. Moreover, the Russians who came were favored not only with better functions and jobs, but also with apartments in Chisinau, to the detriment of the local population. Privatization of houses in favor of citizens was done after the declaration of independence, by the state of the Republic of Moldova.
Even though the Republic of Moldova had to face some economic crises after the declaration of independence, Chisinau continued to develop continuously. Although it is criticized for administrative shortcomings and problems, for the corruption of officials, the destruction of the architectural heritage and the lack of urban vision, Chisinau is developing from an economic point of view, with the largest part of the economy of the Republic of Moldova being concentrated here. The population of Chisinau is growing and, at the same time, it is being built massively in the public and private sphere. Moreover, thanks to European projects, in particular, public transport has been modernized, with European money the main arteries of the city have been repaired, many schools are thermally insulated with the financial support of the EU, etc.
The statements that the city's development plans stopped with the proclamation of independence, that freedom brought poverty and degradation, and that the European course is detrimental to the development of Chisinau, are part of the Kremlin's propaganda, which promotes the thesis that the former Soviet republics have a future only within ""the Russian world"".
Russian propaganda, like the Soviet one, resorts to the falsification of history, in its claims on the territories it occupied by force. Veridica deconstructed several historical forgeries regarding the famine organized in the SSR, the 1918 Union of Bessarabia with Romania, the well-being of the SSR population, regarding the events and consequences of the Second World War.

In reality, Serbian diplomats withdrew from Kiev in the first phase of the war, in March, and never returned. War propaganda aims to sow panic and disorientation within Ukrainian society.
NEWS: The Embassy of Serbia in Ukraine is temporarily closed for security reasons. This announcement was published on the embassy's website on Sunday, October 16.
""The Embassy of the Republic of Serbia in Ukraine is closed to ensure the security of its collaborators,"" the announcement says.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Serbia recommended its citizens to leave Ukraine on time. According to the embassy, ​​the diplomats will spend a period in Belgrade, and this will last until all the necessary conditions for their return to Ukraine are met.
[...]
""Something will happen in Ukraine. China, India, Egypt, Serbia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kargazstan, Tajikistan and Belarus have asked their citizens to leave the country immediately. Kazakhstan closed its embassy in Kiev and also urged all its citizens to leave Ukraine. All these countries are among Russia's partners. It is likely that he received some information through diplomatic channels,"" said Russian political scientist Ramil Harisov.
The same opinion is shared by experts from Europe. ""Serbia closes its embassy in Ukraine for security reasons. It is obvious that all the partners of the Russian Federation have been warned by Moscow about what is to come. What is being prepared is confirmed by the activities on the ground,"" said media expert Anatolii Sarii.
NARRATIVE: The embassies of the countries of the world withdraw from Kiev for fear of the Russian offensive
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian government media writes simultaneously about different topics to manipulate public opinion: the recommendations of the states for their citizens not to travel or to leave Ukraine as much as possible, in the conditions where Russia is bombing Ukrainian infrastructure targets and cities on a daily basis , and the decision of the embassies to withdraw from Kiev. For example, on October 10, the US Embassy in Kyiv urged American citizens to leave Ukraine, but American diplomats were not evacuated. And other states did the same. The embassies of the EU member states, including Romania, but also that of Great Britain, continue to operate in Kiev. On October 11, the British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, wrote on Twitter that the diplomatic representative is in Kiev and will continue to work there.
As for Serbia, this country withdrew its diplomats from Kiev in March and since then they have not returned to Ukraine. An undated announcement regarding the functioning of the diplomatic institution in Belgrade appeared on the embassy's website. The Serbian Embassy did not withdraw now, and not because it was informed about a major Russian offensive, but it has been in Belgrade for more than 7 months. Therefore, the narrative in question is built on the basis of false information.
To give this false information more credibility, the Russian press quotes two so-called experts: one Russian and another European. The Russian is, like all his fellow citizens accepted in the official media, obviously pro-Kremlin and a vector of its propaganda. The ""European expert"" is neither independent nor from any EU state. It is about Anatolii Sarii, a citizen of Ukraine who fled the country and was pursued by the Security Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, being accused of treason state. Over the course of several years, Sarii promoted Russia's propaganda narratives on the territory of Ukraine, founded a pro-Russian party, being a tool of the Kremlin in the Ukrainian political environment. After Sarii fled the country and hid in a European state, the Russian press invites him to broadcasts and quotes him in online publications, presenting him as an independent European expert.
The purpose of the propaganda message is to sow panic and disorientation within the Ukrainian society, but also to convince the public opinion in Russia that the ""special military operation"" is taking place successfully.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the duplicity of the West in the war in Ukraine and Russia's enormous military force. The Russian government press wrote that the Government in Kiev expressed its mistrust in its partners from the West, adding that terrorists are being trained on EU territory who will act against civilians in Donbass. Propaganda tried to convince public opinion that the West is asking Kiev to give in to Moscow, while Ukrainian refugees are housed in former Nazi concentration camps. Publication / Media:

Romanian conspiracists help the disinformation of the Kremlin
verificat.afp.com / 11 Oct. 2022
Bad faith - or maybe just ignorance or naivety - makes thousands of Romanian Facebook users assiduously propagate the Kremlin's misinformation regarding Ukraine. The France Presse agency discovered a gross lie which, after previously being rolled out online in English, French, Finnish, Polish, Hungarian, Slovak and Czech, ended up gathering over 50,000 distributions in its Romanian version. The posts claim that President Volodymyr Zelensky would have sold 28% of Ukraine's territory - that is, 17 million hectares of agricultural land - to three American corporations: Cargill, DuPont and Monsanto. In order to sensitize the public here, the Romanian version also cites accurate data, such as that, compared to Ukraine, ""Romania has 14.8 million hectares of agricultural land"", after which it proclaims, without arguments, that, to unlike the neighboring country, we are already an ""American colony"". The lie of Americans buying a piece of Ukraine is easy to dismantle. Through the reform of the Ukrainian Land Code, which entered into force in the middle of last year, the sale of agricultural land to foreign individuals or legal entities is prohibited. According to the law, only Ukrainian citizens, local authorities or the Ukrainian state can buy land. Moreover, foreign or stateless heirs of Ukrainian agricultural lands can hold these lands for a maximum of one year, after which they must sell them according to the law. As expected, the three American companies mentioned in the posts denied that they own land in Ukraine, a fact confirmed by the latest public reports of the respective companies.
Viral confusion among Londoners
reuters.com / October 11, 2022
The anxiety and fears generated in Europe by the war waged by Russia against Ukraine are sometimes manifested in embarrassing ways. A video filmed from a car driving through the center of London has gathered over one million seven hundred thousand views thanks to an explanation that in less turbulent times would have been rightly dismissed as frivolous. The description, also present on the images, claims that it is about the installation of an anti-aircraft gun on a building under construction in the capital of Great Britain. After locating the construction site, Reuters journalists spoke with representatives of the construction company who explained that the metal structure with a military appearance is nothing but a special equipment, quite common, used for pumping concrete in hard-to-reach areas.
Putin's propaganda on the understanding of a Russian soldier
rainews.it / October 12, 2022
If for any rational person the arguments invoked by Vladimir Putin for the invasion of Ukraine can be described, with indulgence, as paranoid manifestations, the interview with Pavel Gubarev - neo-Nazi in the 90s, governor of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk in 2014, now a volunteer in the Russian army - it shows that the Kremlin's propaganda has found a place in the minds of Russians from the front line.
PAVEL GUBAREV
Volunteer in the Russian army:
""It is very important for us to show the image of the enemies, (Ukrainians) these are actually some Russians possessed by a demon. We did not come here to kill them, but to correct them. But if you don't want to correct yourself, we will kill you! We will kill as much as necessary: ​​one million, five million... We will liquidate all those who do not understand that they are possessed and need healing. Their most possessed man is Zelensky. He's from the possessed tribe, he's Hitler 2.0 (...)""
Online fakes after the Kerchi bridge explosion
apnews.com / Oct. 12 2022; disinfo.detector.media.com / 11 Oct. 2022
The October 8 explosion of the Kerch bridge that connects Russia to the annexed Crimean Peninsula has given rise to the spread of numerous fakes on social networks, from fake footage of the explosion to hoaxes about the perpetrators of the attack. The Associated Press agency identified a video with almost 100,000 views distributed on Twitter immediately after the announcement of the incident, with the claim that it shows images filmed by the dashboard camera of a car on the bridge at the time of the explosion. In reality, although the video contains images filmed on the Kerci bridge, they have been distributed on the Internet since May. An analysis of the clip showed that video effects were added to the original sequences, quite clumsily, to suggest the recent explosion. Another fake with success among the gullible public was discovered by the site disinfo.detector.media.com and proved to be at least as clumsily made. The post shows a Ukrainian identity document, it seems stained with blood and attributed to one of those suspected of attacking the bridge nicknamed ""Putin"". A closer check proved that it is a fake image, in which the names have been replaced , the sex and photo of a young woman on the model of the Ukrainian identity card published on Wikipedia with the photo available on the Internet of an American comedian named Sam Hyde.

""The President of the AUR drew attention to the fact that, through the changes voted within the Commission, any punishment for magistrates who neglect the decisions of the Constitutional Court has been eliminated. The reason for convening the press conference was precisely to express the AUR's concerns regarding the changes voted within the Special Commission that blow up the justice system in Romania.""
""After 20 years, the EU can say that it has fulfilled its plan to destroy a country like Romania, populated with naive citizens who believed that integration would bring them prosperity and freedom, led by politicians who exercised their mandates only in external benefit, strictly concerned with personal rescue strategies.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The judicial reform leads to the undermining of the Constitutional Court and the loss of Romania's sovereignty. 2. Romania's colonization plan succeeded. After resources, labor force and capital, the West managed to get its hands on Romanian justice.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Ever since August, when the first draft amendments to the justice laws (regarding the Superior Council of Magistracy, the judicial organization and the status of judges and prosecutors) were submitted to public debate, the luju.ro website published an article in which announces the disappearance of Romania's sovereignty and, implicitly, of its independence. It is not the first time that Lumea Justitiei spreads fake news, the site being known even in Brussels for its own and personal interpretation of any sentences and movements of justice, in order to serve the interests of the boss of the Intact group, the criminal Dan Voiculescu. Over time, this site has created articles that are certainly envied even by colleagues from Sputnik or distributed fake news so gross that their dismantling could be done in record time for such an approach.
With the return to public attention of the debates on the laws of justice, the sovereignist propaganda was strongly reactivated, and the conclusion of those from luju.ro was amplified and spread on all the channels available to it. At the initiative of former judge Adrian Toni Neacsu, a criminal in his turn, a petition was also initiated to stop the modification of the laws of justice, a little over 17,000 Romanians adhering to its content. The home websites and broadcasts of characters such as Diana Ivanovici Sosoaca, Cozmin Gusa, Iosefina Pascal or the leader of the AUR party, George Simion took over, distributed and amplified the information, leaving aside really important aspects of the three laws, which would really be deserved a wider dialogue.
The Constitutional Court of Romania has given, in recent years, several decisions that generated controversies, which brought accusations that they would serve the interests of some corrupt politicians. At the same time, some decisions taken by the Constitutional Court violated EU legislation - although the Constitution itself provides for its supremacy - and attracted criticism from the European Court of Justice and the European Commission.
For obvious manipulative purposes, the anti-Western propaganda omits to say that not a few times, the Constitutional Court of Romania has issued some extremely controversial decisions and harshly criticized by the legal community, there are even voices that affirmed that the CCR has exceeded its powers or that it wants to and increase them. We remind you of the partial decriminalization of abuse of office, a decision that led to the classification of more than 800 corruption files in various stages of investigation. Over time, the press has documented several decisions that have brought the Romanian judiciary to its knees in matters of criminal law. The 9 members of the Court, politically appointed by the Parliament and the President, were at the center of the debates and in the midst of the pandemic when they decided that home isolation, quarantine and internment cannot be imposed only on the basis of a ministerial order, even if the persons concerned are infected with the new coronavirus. Later, the CCR also intervened in the issue of contravention fines for non-compliance with the restrictions imposed in the lockdown, a decision seized extremely cynically by the sovereignists and presented as a victory of the people against the health dictatorship. At the end of the CCR portrait, we also remember how two of its members granted themselves special pensions.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the justice reform. Promoting sovereignist and anti-Western discourse, undermining confidence in the current governing coalition for electoral purposes and forcing early elections (the failed initiative following the resounding failure of the October 2 protests)
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The entire sovereignist narrative is based on the removal from law 303/2004 (regarding the status of judges and prosecutors) of article 99, letter s: ""Constitutes disciplinary violations: non-compliance with the decisions of the Constitutional Court or the decisions pronounced by the High Court of Cassation and Justice in resolving appeals in the interest of the law"". Therefore, we note from the very beginning that the article in question refers to decisions of the ICCJ and CCR and not to the Romanian Constitution.
The decisions of the High Court of Cassation and Justice discussed in the respective paragraph are those related to the appeal in the interest of the law. This is a legal procedure through which the ICCJ ensures that the laws are interpreted and applied uniformly by all the courts in the country. More specifically, upon notification to the general prosecutor of the Public Prosecutor's Office next to the ICCJ, ex officio or at the request of the Minister of Justice, the Governing Board of the ICCJ, the governing boards of the Courts of Appeal or the People's Advocate, when two or more courts give solutions different on the same law, a panel of 25 judges determines which interpretation of the law is the correct one and will become the norm from that moment. This decision has effects only in the future, the court decisions examined and the situation of the parties involved in those processes remaining unchanged. The decisions of the ICCJ in the case of an appeal in the interest of the law, just like any other judicial decision, are based on the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court, the European Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice of the European Union, as well as on the doctrine in the matter and the opinions of the consulted specialists, so the risk that a judicial decision contravenes one of the ICCJ is extremely rare.
In defense of the Constitution trampled by the world occult, the propagandists invoke article 147, which, in paragraph 4, says that: ""Decisions of the Constitutional Court are published in the Official Monitor of Romania."" From the date of publication, the decisions are generally binding and have power only for the future."" What the fighters for the country's independence do not say is that article 148, paragraph 2, stipulates the obligation to comply with European norms with priority: ""As a result of accession, the provisions the constitutive treaties of the European Union, as well as the other binding community regulations, have priority over the contrary provisions of internal laws, in compliance with the provisions of the act of accession."" In addition, article 20 of the same holy Constitution says as clearly as possible that: ""If there are inconsistencies between the pacts and treaties regarding fundamental human rights, to which Romania is a party, and the internal laws, the international regulations have priority, with the exception of in the case where the Constitution or internal laws contain more favorable provisions."" In Romanian, only if the domestic legislation is more favorable to the citizen, the Constitution becomes binding in front of the international legislation to which our country has acceded.
The principle was explained by the Minister of Justice, Catalin Predoiu, since August, namely that all sources of law with a binding nature are and remain binding, and the judge must have full freedom and independence in their interpretation and application. In conclusion, the national legislation is not in competition with the European one. In case of a conflict between the rules, the judges will establish which of them applies with priority, without asserting its supremacy in relation to the other. In this way, the supremacy of the Constitution over the rest of the internal laws is ensured, as well as the specific hierarchy of the order of international legislation. It is equally obvious that, even if from now on the judges will no longer be obliged to comply with the decisions of the CCR, this does not automatically mean that they will only judge according to the laws, treaties and regulations of the European Union. In any case, none of the whistleblowers of the loss of Romanian sovereignty explained which European law norms are so bad that their application would seriously and irreparably damage Romania.
Regarding Romania's ""colony"" status, here we are dealing with a thesis promoted intensively by Russian and pro-Russian propaganda and it is a direct continuation of the Cold War theses regarding the usurping and exploiting West. Romania is the one that asked to be accepted in the EU and made the commitment that, as a member, it would accept and adopt the common rules for all the member states. Although the economic and political strength of Romania is not as great as that of to the majority of member states (which may translate into less influence at the EU level) it is, legally, a member that has exactly the same rights and obligations as the others. It can be argued that, with EU integration, all countries they gave up part of their sovereignty, but it should be noted that the main decisions of the EU are taken by the consensus of the member states.

169,671,Russia withdrew from PACE because it did not want gays in the State Duma,Russia withdrew from the APCE because it did not want gays in the State Duma,False,[],"['Russia', 'PACE']",,,,,,,https://ukraina.ru/20221017/1039825550.html,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-rusia-s-a-retras-din-apce-pentru-ca-n-a-vrut-gay-in-duma-de-stat,,18.10.2022,,,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-rusia-s-a-retras-din-apce-pentru-ca-n-a-vrut-gay-in-duma-de-stat,,"Russia withdrew from PACE, in March 2022, because it does not have gay parliamentarians, although this is mandatory for the member states. The false narrative was launched by the president of the State Duma in Moscow, Viaceslav Volodin. In reality, Russia withdrew because it was going to be excluded from PACE due to the invasion of Ukraine. The subject was resurrected because PACE designated Russia as a terrorist state.
NEWS: ""The President of the State Duma Viaceslav Volodin declared that the absence of homosexual men in the Russian parliament was one of the reasons for Russia's withdrawal from the PACE. The statement was made on October 17 during the parliamentary hearings. According to Volodin, the vice-president of the State Duma, Piotr Tolstoy, received a form at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, according to which the lower and upper chambers of the Russian parliament must send representatives of the LGBT community to a joint meeting as a matter of priority. We don't have such representatives, that's why we didn't fill out the form [...].
Volodin stated that he received many addresses regarding the adoption of the law on the protection of traditional family values"".
NARRATIVE: Russia withdrew from PACE because it has no gay parliamentarians.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: For several years, the Putin regime has been trying to present Russia (for the external public and, especially for the internal public) as a besieged fortress, a space of traditional values ​​and morality that is in antithesis to ""Gayropa"". a space of depravity in which not only homosexuality, but also pedophilia are tolerated and encouraged. The West would be behind a real assault aimed at imposing the LGBT ideology in Russia.
The invasion of Ukraine isolated Russia internationally. The unjustified and unprovoked attack on an independent country, the brutality of the Russian army and the war crimes committed by it, from the bombing of civilian targets to summary executions, torture and rape, the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions, etc. they were condemned not only by the West, which became the main supporter of Ukraine, but also by NGOs specialized in human rights and international organizations (UN General Assembly, OSCE, APCE). Russia's response to this wave of condemnations caused by its aggression and crimes was to victimize itself and invent various pretexts and justifications, many of which have been used by Kremlin propaganda for years: that its values ​​are threatened, that it is fighting Nazism, that it is surrounded and attacked by the West, that it is the target of terrorist attacks, etc.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the delegations of the states in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe are not formed according to the ethnic principle, race or gender. APCE aims to defend human rights and promote diversity and tolerance. The state delegations to the PACE are composed of parliamentarians elected in free elections, and the Council of Europe cannot intervene or influence the citizens to choose certain candidates. Viaceslav Volodin's statement has no legal basis, and the non-representation of sexual minorities in parliament is not a reason for exclusion from the Council of Europe, nor for the withdrawal of the delegation. In fact, PACE decided to exclude the Russian Federation from the Council of Europe after the invasion of Ukraine, and the adopted document provides for the termination of membership for the Russian delegation due to its incompatibility with the organization's principles.
""There is no place for an aggressor in the common European home. The Committee of Ministers should request the Russian Federation to withdraw from the Council of Europe. If the Russian Federation does not comply with the request, the Committee of Ministers must consider the immediate possible date from which the Russian Federation ceases to be a member of the Council of Europe"", according to the APCE opinion.
Volodin claims that Russia was not excluded, but that it withdrew. In fact, knowing that the Russian delegation will be excluded from the organization, the representative of Moscow, Piotr Tolstoy, submitted an official letter of withdrawal from the Council of Europe in time. Therefore, Russia withdrew from the Council of Europe before being excluded. In the Russian press, there was no information about the exclusion of Russia, but about the withdrawal of the Russian delegation. The truth is hidden from Russian citizens in order to maintain public opinion in the internal informational space in which the need to carry out the ""special military operation"" is justified on a daily basis.
The false narrative was not picked up by accident. On October 13, PACE designated Russia as a terrorist state by adopting a resolution entitled ""The escalation continues in Russia's aggression against Ukraine"". 99 members of the assembly voted for the resolution, and one abstained. Russian propaganda tries to demonstrate to public opinion that this resolution has no value, it is not representative, arguing that Russia intentionally withdrew from there.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the positions of international organizations regarding the war in Ukraine. The Russian press wrote that the referendums on the annexation to Russia of the territories in the east and south of Ukraine respect the UN Charter, and the UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control Ukraine's seaports.
According to some propaganda narratives, the OSCE collaborates with the ""Azov"" regiment in Mariupol and provides it with information from the very beginning of the conflict in Donbass, while the West investigates the atrocities committed by Ukrainian nationalists on the territory of Ukraine.

In reality, only the ban on blocking the streets was imposed, after protesters organized by the party of the fugitive oligarch Ilan Sor set up tents on the main artery of Chisinau, causing traffic jams.
NEWS: ""The Commission for Exceptional Situations of the Republic of Moldova prohibited the organization of protest actions on working days. And during rest periods, their duration cannot exceed four hours. Also, on working days, demonstrators do not have the right to block transport arteries and access to public institutions""
NARRATIVE: The pro-European government in Chisinau has turned into an authoritarian regime that prohibits anti-government protests.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In Chisinau, protest actions organized by the Sor Party, led by the fugitive oligarch Ilan Sor, convicted in the first instance for the bank robbery of approximately one billion dollars in 2014, have been taking place in Chisinau for a month. These are taking place in the context of a deep economic and social crises caused by inflation and the war in Ukraine.
The demonstrators set up tents in the center of Chisinau, and on October 9 they blocked Stefan cel Mare boulevard, the city's main road, making traffic difficult and causing traffic jams on Monday morning, until the police removed the tents. Later, the police announced that they found prohibited items in the tents.
OBJECTIVE: To present the pro-European government in Chisinau as authoritarian and anti-democratic.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The authorities did not ban protests on weekdays, as the Russian publication writes, but blocked the streets on those days. ""The holding of meetings with the blocking of traffic lanes, transport arteries or access and evacuation routes to public institutions will be prohibited on working days. On days off, these meetings can be held for a maximum of four hours"", according to the CSE decision.
It should be noted that a state of emergency was decreed in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis caused by it, a valid measure, following several extensions, including the current period. During the state of emergency, protests are prohibited. Some political scientists recommended the government to make use of this provision, but the representatives of the executive stated that they will allow peaceful protests to take place.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: After the demonstrators of the Sor Party blocked the Stefan cel Mare boulevard in Chisinau, the Commission for Exceptional Situations really imposed certain prohibitions related to the organization of protests. Publication / Media:

In reality, the former USSR and Nazi Germany had agreements to divide Europe and, together, attacked Poland. Similarly, Russia is now the aggressor state, the West limiting itself to helping Ukraine defend itself.
NEWS: ""We cannot allow Ukraine to create permanent dangers for the security of the Russian Federation [...] I am convinced that without the elimination of Nazism from Ukraine, it will be very difficult for us to solve the problem of our coexistence on the European continent.
I am very reserved about Europe's position. If we talk about the Nazis, during Nazi Germany Adolf Hitler united under his flag most of the states in Europe to attack and destroy the Soviet Union. At the moment, roughly the same group of states support Volodymyr Zelensky, who is nowhere near a Hitler, but he determines the actions directed against the Russian Federation. He also receives instructions on what to do. Despite this fact, the flag of the new Nazi international is the same"", declared Sergey Lavrov during the program ""60 minutes"" of the government television station Russia 1.
NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine is a Nazi state 2. Volodymyr Zelensky created a new ""Nazi international"" made up of European states. 3. Nazi Germany was supported by European states to destroy the USSR.
CONTEXT: One of the characteristics of the Putin regime is the attempt to present an alternative history, especially regarding the Second World War. The narrative that the Kremlin is trying to impose is that Russia was the main victim of the conflict and the victor of Nazi Germany. Putin's Russia emphasizes the Soviet celebration of Victory Day (and smaller ones). Most of the time, Russia appeals to history to show that the USSR denazified the European states in the past, and they are not grateful to Moscow for their liberation.
At the same time, the aggression against Ukraine was justified by Russian propaganda, since 2014, by the need to combat an alleged fascist/Nazi regime that would have installed itself in Kiev. The large-scale invasion launched on February 24 had, among the pretexts, the ""denazification of Ukraine"". The West is accused of supporting a ""neo-Nazi Ukrainian regime"", which organized ""a genocide against Russian speakers"".
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of these narratives is to demonstrate to Russian public opinion that Kiev's policy is a Nazi one, and the West wants to destroy the Russian state as Hitler wanted. The false narratives indirectly justify the necessity of mobilization on the territory of Russia, creating the impression of repeating the second world conflagration.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In Ukraine, any public display of communist or Nazi ideology has been prohibited by law since 2015, and far-right groups have never been in government, obtaining low scores in elections (and, in the last election, below the electoral threshold). In addition, not even Russia has ever offered credible evidence to support its theses regarding Ukrainian ""Nazism"". For Moscow, everything that does not coincide with the ideology of the ""Russian world"" is a Nazi.
Volodymyr Zelenski had no way of creating a Nazi international from European states, given that the Nazi ideology is banned and condemned at the EU level, and the far-right formations, even if they had some notable recent results in countries like Italy and Sweden, they were never a dominant force in the community space. The EU (and the rest of the West) did not impose sanctions and does not support Ukraine by supplying military equipment to destroy the Russian state, but to help the Ukrainians resist an unprovoked aggression. Russia, as the aggressor, is the one that set out to destroy another state, which the Putin regime considers artificial and part of the so-called ""Russian world"".
The UN, the most important international organization, has repeatedly condemned Russia's unprovoked aggression against Ukraine. On October 12, the General Assembly voted with an overwhelming majority of 143 votes in favor of a resolution condemning the ""attempted illegal annexation"" of four Ukrainian regions and demanding that Russia withdraw its troops immediately. Only four states - Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Nicaragua - voted against, along with Russia. In other words, 143 countries of the world do not believe in Russia's false narratives about the need to ""denazify"" Ukraine by military means. It is a coalition of world states fighting for the maintenance of international law, not for the destruction of Russia, as stated by Lavrov, quoted by the Russian press. In fact, both Lavrov and Putin have been building the myth of Russia as a besieged city in their speeches for several years, using the news about the new sanctions or the delivery of weapons to Ukraine to convince the public opinion that they all want to see the Russian state on the ground.
Regarding the history of the Second World War, Lavrov continues the propaganda messages from the time of the Soviet regime when it was forbidden to talk about the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of 1939 for the division of Europe. Soviet historiography presented Moscow as a victim of Nazi Germany's attack, and not as an accomplice and an aggressor who, together with Germany, started the war in Europe. According to the dominant narratives in Russia, inherited from the Soviet era, the USSR liberated Europe from Nazis and fascists, sacrificed itself for the future of humanity, but, unfortunately, the West does not want to be grateful to Russia as the heir of the Soviet Union for the heroism of the past.
It should be noted that two weeks after Nazi Germany invaded Poland, on September 1, 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Nazi Adolf Hitler divided Poland and the Baltic countries through a secret protocol. Other raptures followed, including the annexation of Bessarabia and Bucovina from Romania. A European Parliament resolution from 2019 points out that the Second World War, the most devastating war in the history of Europe, was started as an immediate result of the notorious Nazi-Soviet non-aggression and cooperation pact of August 23, 1939, called and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
Moreover, during the war, most of the states in Europe fought against Germany, and not alongside it, and the states of the West, especially the USA, supported the USSR in the most difficult times of the world conflagration, their assistance having a role decisive in the victory finally obtained by the Russians. It should be noted, at the same time, that while the USSR advanced from the east and occupied the countries that were on the route, imposing criminal communist dictatorships, the Western Allies liberated the European states in the west, which maintained their democracies and were helped (by the Marshall plan) to recover their savings.

In reality, the massive attack killed dozens of civilians on the territory of Ukraine, and rockets hit houses, parks, critical and social infrastructure, Russia being accused of terrorism.
NEWS: ""Russia's recent attack on Ukrainian infrastructure was a ""symbolic"" one. Russia must not fight with half strength if it wants to defeat Ukraine, the Polish publicist and political scientist said in an interview for Ukraina.ru Konrad Rekas [...].
You will not succeed in building a new world order if you have mercy and fight with half strength. If you don't have the necessary will to fight - you have to make peace. If you want to be victorious - you have to fight much more seriously"", writes Ukraina.ru, quoting Rekas.
In another article, Ukraina.ru mentions that ""the Kiev regime systematically organizes terrorist attacks on Russian citizens"", and Moscow is forced to respond and liberate all regions of Ukraine. The Polish political scientist is again quoted: Stalin didn't just drive Hitler to the former borders of the USSR. He didn't tell Rokossovski on the Bug: ""Enough, it's not our territory anymore, stop the denazification! Organize a referendum there and go home! Don't bomb the no one there because the media from the West will write badly about us"".
NARRATIVE: Russia showed restraint when it launched the massive attack by which it reacted to the bombing of the Kerchi bridge.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: On October 10, Russia launched 84 missiles and 24 drones at Ukraine, with an average total value of 700 million dollars, according to Forbes. More than half of the missiles were shot down by the anti-aircraft defense system, according to Kiev. On October 11, Russia launched 28 missiles at Ukraine, of which 20 were allegedly shot down. Also, 13 Iranian drones were shot down, as Kiev claims. If all the missiles hit the target, the destruction in Ukraine would have been at least 2-3 times greater and many more civilians would have been killed.
The official explanation was that the bombings represent Russia's response to the explosion that damaged the Kerch bridge, illegally built by Russia to make a land connection with the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, invaded and illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014. Ukraine has not admitted any responsibility in the explosion that damaged the bridge, which for Vladimir Putin has a great symbolic significance. The bombings also took place against the backdrop of Ukrainian victories on the front both in the east of Ukraine and in the south. It should be noted that the targets were civilians - either residential areas or infrastructure elements (30% of the energy sector was damaged) - without any military value, which shows that the civilian population was the target, aiming to demoralize and terrorize it .
Finally, it should be noted that since the beginning of the war, civilians have repeatedly been the target of Russian attacks, among the notable cases being the bombing of the theater in Mariupol, the railway station in Kramatorsk, the convoy near Zaporozhye, etc. To these are added the numerous Russian attacks on residential areas, educational and medical institutions, the thousands of war crimes, from summary executions, torture and forced displacement to rapes, documented by international organizations and the Ukrainian prosecutor's office. They all point to a strategy that includes the intentional attack of civilian targets, in no case can it be said that the Russians are making efforts to avoid such targets.
The international community condemned the latest attacks (as it did before, in similar situations), and a spokesman for the EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy Josep Borrell, Peter Stano, said that Russia's actions appear to be, ""war crimes"", and those who are guilty of them must ""account"".
On October 13, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) designated Russia as a terrorist state by adopting a resolution entitled ""Continued escalation in Russian aggression against Ukraine"".
Despite these reactions of the international community, the Russian press tries to justify the missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, quoting a Polish political scientist known for his radical pro-Russian positions and in favor of aggression against Ukraine, who collaborated in the last 10 years with various television stations and newspapers from Moscow. Konrad Rekas was a member of various Polish nationalist parties, he was a columnist and correspondent of Pravda newspaper from Moscow. The Polish political scientist is also a member of the European Center for Geopolitical Analysis, based in Poland and which has branches in Russia. This center, according to the Russian media, sent observers to various elections in separatist regions such as Ossetia, Abkhazia or Transnistria.
Rekas does not represent the Polish academic environment, mostly illustrating Russian propaganda narratives like many other experts from abroad who collaborate with the pro-Kremlin press.
Based on the statements of Rekas, the Russian press is trying to convince the public opinion that the attacks did not affect the lives of civilians in Ukraine and that Russia's war is a fair one, with a human face.
The same Konrad Reka calls the Russian army to be tougher and to ""denazify"" all Ukrainian regions, making false allusions to the history of the Second World War.
In reality, the Ukrainian army cannot be compared in any way to the Nazi troops, and Russia's war is one of invading a territory, an unprovoked act of aggression condemned by the international community.
In July 2015, Ukraine banned by law any public manifestation of communist and Nazi ideology, so the statement that this state must be ""denazified"" is meaningless. In addition, Ukrainian soldiers participated in the Soviet army's victory over Nazism.
141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine and that it is a terrorist state.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media, according to which the inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region are waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis. The pro-Kremlin press also wrote that because of Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, not occupied. Russian propaganda tried to convince the Russian society without any evidence that the nationalist leader Stepan Bandera was canonized in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

Iran: X-ray of masked protests
bbc.com/news, 5 Oct. 2022
Images that the dictatorial leadership of Iran would not want the world to see: policemen shooting civilians in the middle of the street, angry women cutting their hair in public and burning their hijabs, student demonstrations. Iranians revolted against the authorities after a woman died in police custody. The government has blocked access to the Internet. Disinformation has dominated the state media and social networks. It all started with the death of Mahsa Amini, arrested by the dreaded Morality Police for negligently wearing the hijab. According to several sources, the 22-year-old woman was beaten in the police car after the arrest. The government released images from a surveillance camera, claiming that, without being assaulted, the young woman would have died of a heart attack. It was the spark that ignited the revolt. At the funeral, Iranian women tore their waves as a sign of solidarity. Given the total ban imposed on foreign media, the images distributed online represent vital evidence for deciphering the violence. Starting from these and from the statements of the witnesses, BBC journalists analyzed a thousand videos, managing to identify the main foci of an unprecedented protest, minimized by the authorities. They took as landmarks buildings, monuments or other clues from the images, which they compared with satellite views and street photos. In the end, they located on the map 300 protests generated by Amini's death. In just 16 days, the disturbances spread almost throughout the country. The BBC notes not only the unprecedented scale, but also the unprecedented nature of the protests: women cutting their hair and defying the dress code in public, bravely confronting the violence of policemen in uniform or plainclothes. The images sensitized many Iranians. To stop their spread, the authorities blocked access to data for mobile phones last week. Immediately, the number of online searches with the keywords ""Mahsa Amini"" dropped drastically. On the other hand, the government described the protesters as ""vandals"" and accused them of destroying ambulances. However, BBC journalists revealed the full picture: the ambulances sent to the demonstrations are used by the security forces to transport those arrested. As can be seen in some videos, the people who manage to escape from the rescue vehicles run away. Besides, there are images of ambulances that, instead of going to hospitals, end up in front of police stations. According to the sources cited by the BBC, dozens of protesters have been killed, which only serves to maintain the anger towards the brutality of the rulers in Tehran. Meanwhile, Nika Shakarami - a 16-year-old Kurdish protester brutally killed by the police - became the new face of the Iranian revolt.
Russian propaganda: new tactics, old tricks
apnews.com / October 5, 2022
Russia has found a way to spread disinformation about its invasion of Ukraine, using new digital tricks to get its propaganda videos around restrictions imposed by governments and hi-tech companies. According to the experts of the specialized American company Nisos, quoted by the Associated Press, the method allows tens of clips in 18 different languages ​​to be distributed from accounts linked to the press controlled by the Kremlin without leaving traces or electronic clues to help identify the source. The videos promote the conspiracy theory of blaming Ukrainians for their own civilian casualties as well as the false idea that residents of forcibly annexed areas welcome the occupiers as liberators. The English versions of the propaganda clips are already circulating on Twitter and on lesser-known but popular platforms among American conservatives, such as Gab and Truth Social - created by former President Donald Trump, providing Russia with direct access to millions of people. Nisos analysts say that the ingenuity of this approach allows downloading clips directly from Telegram channels, without leaving the traces usually sought by researchers. The European Union banned Russia Today and Sputnik - the main vectors of Russian propaganda - immediately after the start of the war. The Russians' efforts to circumvent the restrictions were felt immediately. The most recent involve uploading videos to Telegram, a moderate platform relatively popular in Eastern Europe and used by many conservatives in the United States. In some cases, video identification logos, such as ""RT"", are removed as an additional measure to disguise the source. From Telegram, the clips are downloaded and reposted on platforms such as Twitter, without labels or other indications that they come from the Russian state media. The hundreds of accounts that then post or . repost the clips are related, according to experts from Nisos, to the army, embassies or state media in Russia. Some accounts seem to use fake profile photos or post messages in a bizarre pattern that denotes a lack of authenticity. Twitter labels content identified as coming from Russian media. The company says that since late February it has tagged more than 900,000 distinct tweets that suggested links to Kremlin-controlled publications such as Russia Today. The Associated Press recalls that several conspiratorial messages posted on Twitter two weeks ago accused the United States, without any evidence, of sabotaging the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea. At the same time, the company Meta announced the discovery of a vast Russian disinformation network that created the site- camouflaged in an appearance similar to the pages of some well-known European publications.
The falsity of the restrictions imposed on supporters at the 2022 World Cup
reuters.com / October 6, 2022
Emotions for football supporters who are preparing to support their national teams next month at the World Cup in Qatar. The content of a poster entitled ""Qatar will welcome you"" distributed on social networks discouraged many users due to the harshness of the requirements stated in Arabic and English. The eight rules, from the prohibition of alcohol consumption and romantic meetings to avoiding noise and of any indecent behavior, appeared to have the official seal of the tournament organizers. Reuters reporters contacted the Supreme Organizing Committee in Doha, which stated that the document in question did not come from official sources and contained factually incorrect information. It was later discovered that the author of the poster is a citizens' group, entitled ""Show your respect!"", founded in 2014 with the aim of reminding foreigners that they must take into account the country's ultraconservative customs.

In reality, the company will only be listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, and only the 19.94% owned by Fondul Proprietatea will be put up for sale.
NEWS: ""Fond Proprietatea no longer belongs to the Romanians. Fondul Proprietatea is owned by a bank from the United States of America, about 10-12%, the Bank of New York Mellon, something like the NN private pension fund, the Allianz-Tiriac private pension fund, I don't know which investors from abroad, the Ministry of Public Finance also has about 6%, but, attention, the president of Fondul Proprietatea was the former ambassador of the United States in Romania, Mark Gitenstein. Eight years, three mandates! He gave up his mandate from 2020 or 2021, he resigned because in the meantime he was appointed the ambassador of the United States to the EU. And more than that, [...], he is the one who put Kovesi at DNA. Fondul Proprietatea became the property of foreigners, because, say the newspapers, Basescu had to pay his debt to Gitenstein, and Gitenstein became the president of Fondul Proprietatea. [...] At this moment, Hidroelectrica is going to be listed on the Romanian stock exchange, and the shareholders' committee requested and said that it will ignore everything that the Romanian leadership says, that they are only slaves, and they will also list it on the stock exchange to London. So Hidroelectrica will no longer be Romanian. The moment when the 20% from Fondul Proprietatea will be quoted in London and in Bucharest, on Bucharest, please, come on, abureala... Yes, when you arrive in London it is very clear to me that someone is very well prepared, I assume that all something about the United States, the owner of the 20% will end up. (Lazarus: Rothschild!) Rothschild, obviously! The idea is as follows: through a legal process, through which even Petromu' was taken over by foreigners, because the majority shares were not sold. There is a process called capital increase. When you do a capital increase, at that moment, through a very interesting legal procedure, you end up owning the most shares and you end up being a minority shareholder, a majority shareholder. That's how the majority of those who bought Romania's industry became majority."" (Diana Iovanovici Sosoaca, on Luis Lazarus-Zeus TV, from min. 44:25)
NARRATIVE: The West is forcing Romania to give up its resources.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In a live dialogue on Facebook between Luis Lazarus, a journalist more famous for the fines received throughout his career from the CNA than for the journalism practiced, and Senator Diana Iovanovici Sosoaca, among many other untruths, the information was also circulated that Hidroelectrica, the most valuable Romanian company with state capital, valued at approximately 25 billion lei, will be sold on international markets. The information was subtly slipped in at the beginning of the dialogue by Lazarus and later developed by Diana Sosoaca.
Declared the political personality of the year 2021 by sputnik.md, Senator Diana Iovanovici Sosoaca has been noticed over time through various scandals in which she was involved, but also through the promotion of theses, false narratives and disinformation very similar to those launched in Russia. Initially visible by participating in the protests against the so-called ""medical dictatorship"", whose central figures were close to the embassy of the Russian Federation in Bucharest, Diana Sosoaca spread some disinformation and fake news regarding the coronavirus and the anti-Covid vaccine (see , for example, the narrative dismantled by Veridica according to which the vaccine would cause sterility for three generations), and made efforts to combat the vaccination campaign. At the same time, he promoted sovereignist and anti-EU theses (including the denial of the existence of the war in Ukraine) which , have also appeared over time in numerous disinformation and false narratives originating in Russia.
In the narrative regarding Hidroelectrica, the name Rotschild is also circulated. For generations, this family has been the target of conspiracy theories that are, in essence, anti-Semitic; most recently, there was talk about Rothschild in the context of the war in Ukraine: a conspiracy theory, also promoted in Romania by Cozmin Gusa, says that Rothschild would have bought the entire debt of Ukraine; the thesis regarding the intention of the Rothschild group to seize the assets of Romania and the Romanians is a similar one.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the authorities and the entire political class, as well as promoting the sovereignist, anti-Western discourse.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In her characteristic style, Senator Sosoaca presents truncated real information, in order to distort the overall picture. Indeed, The Bank of New York Mellon currently owns shares in Fondul Proprietatea, but only 14.20% of the shares. The percentage held is decreasing compared to the beginning of the year when BNY Mellon held 16.63% of the shares. In 2018, for example, the same financial institution held 28.90% of the fund's shares. It is also true that the two private pension funds mentioned (NN and Allianz-Tiriac) are shareholders of the fund, but that is only because they bought shares from the free market. The purpose of any pension fund is to make a profit, in its own interest and that of the depositors; we do not see how the Romanian state could have prevented the purchase of the respective shares by any investor on the stock exchange in a free market.
The statement ""Fondul Proprietatea no longer belongs to the Romanians"" is invalid from the start, as the respective fund never belonged to the Romanians, but only to the Romanians who own shares in this fund. But, even so, currently, the FP shareholding structure is presented as follows: 72.47% - Romanian institutional shareholders + Romanian natural persons + Ministry of Public Finance + FP own shares and 27.53% - BNY Mellon + Foreign institutional shareholders + Non-resident natural persons. Regarding the presidency of Fondul Proprietatea and the former American ambassador Mark Gitenstein , Diana Sosoaca uses another truncated truth, that, indeed, the American diplomat was part of the Committee of Representatives of the Proprietatea Fund, but he never held the position of president, as suggested a year ago by the anti-Semitic publication Incorect Political: The rest of the information are just narratives taken from the media of the times when Traian Basescu was president of Romania and Laura Codruta Kovesi was the chief prosecutor of the DNA, seasoned with personal speculations.
The same type of discourse (fragments of truth and extremely subjective forecasts) is also used when the senator brings up Hidroelectrica S.A. ""Hidroelectrica will no longer be Romanian"" is the verdict given by the people's senator, immediately after she announced that ""the shareholders' committee requested and said that it will ignore everything that the Romanian leadership says, that they are only slaves, and they will rate it"" and at the London Stock Exchange."" We don't know exactly what he means when he says the shareholders' committee, but we know that the Hidroelectrica General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) has only two members: the Romanian state through the Ministry of Energy and Fondul Proprietatea. Thus, in the AGM decision no. 3/31.03.2022, only the initiation of the admission to trading of the shares held by FP on the Bucharest Stock Exchange was approved. Neither in this document, nor in the others issued later, listing on the London Stock Exchange is requested. For the sake of analysis, we will go further on the narrative line of Mrs. Sosoaca and assume that, once listed on the London Stock Exchange, the 19.94% shares will all be bought by Rothschild. Making a parenthesis, we see no reason why this should not happen after the listing of the company in Bucharest or that through the listing in Bucharest not even one share should be sold and all of them end up for sale in London. But this time we will give credit to a dignitary of the Romanian state. Next, the senator from Iasi tells us that there will be a capital increase, so that the respective owner of the shares becomes the majority. What the senator does not say is that the capital increase can only be made after changing the company's articles of incorporation. An equally interesting legal procedure, the amendment of the constitutive act can only be done on the basis of a decision of the General Assembly, an assembly in which the Romanian state will still have a vote of 80.06%. It is true that voices from the management of Fondul Proprietatea suggested a dual listing of the shares, but the Romanian state requested the listing of the shares only on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. In conclusion, putting up for sale the almost 20 percent of Hidroelectrica shares is a commitment taken by the Romanian government through PNRR, part of chapter R3: Improving the corporate governance of state-owned companies in the sector, and in no case an evil alienation plan of the country's resources.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The representatives of Fondul Proprietatea say that the banks with which they had discussions regarding the listing of Hidroelectrica concluded that the listing of the 20% package of the fund is difficult to achieve only on the BVB and that the listing should also take place on the London Stock Exchange.

In reality, the International Legion within the Ukrainian army has small numbers, and the NATO leadership has repeatedly declared that it will not intervene militarily in the war.
NEWS: ""When the representation of the foreign contingent in the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be greater than 50%, NATO's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine will pass from the de facto to the de jure status,"" the military espionage veteran said live on Soloviov Live , the hero of Russia, Rustem Klupov, according to the ""PolitNavigator"" correspondent.
[...]
""According to Russian intelligence data, 30% of the Ukrainian army is made up of foreign mercenaries, but soon the number of foreigners will exceed 50%. We are not far from seeing in the near future how they will change their uniform to the national one and will be presented to us as regular NATO troops,"" said Klupov.
The presenter Vladimir Solovyov recalled that there are already several thousand Poles in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
""For now, we are told that they are not NATO troops, but national military forces from Poland. They distance themselves declaratively from NATO membership. ""NATO troops are military formations that are directly subordinated to the Alliance,"" the expert explained.
NARRATIVE: Half of the soldiers of the Ukrainian army are foreigners, which means that NATO is participating in the war.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The number of foreign soldiers in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is not 30% or 50%. In the context of Ukraine's successful counter-offensive in the east and north of the country, Russian propaganda resumed a series of false narratives regarding the numerous battalions of English, French, Poles and representatives of other states fighting in Ukraine. On the show of the Russian journalist Vladimir Solovyov, the failures of the Russian army on the battlefield are explained, most of the time, by the de facto presence of NATO troops on the territory of Ukraine.
In reality, NATO troops are not fighting on the territory of Ukraine. The Secretary General of the Alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, has repeatedly stated that NATO does not have regular troops on Ukrainian territory. ""We have the responsibility to prevent this conflict from expanding beyond the borders of Ukraine and becoming an open war between Russia and NATO,"" Stoltenberg said. On the other hand, a number of Western states provide Ukraine with weapons, equipment , ammunition, necessary for Kiev's defense of its territory from the aggression of the Russian Federation.
The Russian press misinforms the public opinion when it reports on the foreign soldiers who make up 30-50% of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In May a.c. President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that Ukraine is defended against Russian aggression by a number of 700,000 soldiers. He said that Ukraine has well-trained soldiers, and NATO states have modern weaponry that must be offered to Ukraine and that could change the situation on the battlefield.
In March 2022, over 20 thousand volunteers from countries such as the USA, Norway, Denmark, but also from the Republic of Moldova and Belarus submitted applications for registration in the International Legion. Therefore, the number of those who have registered in the International Legion up to the present moment cannot be 350 thousand, that is 50% of the army. Moreover, the International Legion also includes citizens of post-Soviet states that have no connection with NATO. For example, 4 battalions of Chechen soldiers are fighting on the territory of Ukraine, who oppose the aggression of the Russian Federation and support their leader in exile, Ahmed Zakaev.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aim to present NATO as an active participant in the war in Ukraine. In June, the Russian press wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace. In May, Russian propaganda distributed information about the EU's fear of tuberculosis originating from NATO laboratories in Ukraine. In April, the pro-Kremlin press accused Ukraine of wanting to join NATO in order to attack Russia. Publication / Media:

In reality, beyond be coagulated, the pro-Russian opposition is marked by increasingly visible misunderstandings, the protests are far from massive, and the participants are paid for their presence.
NEWS: ""In the Republic of Moldova, several weeks in a row, there are rallies with the participation of thousands of people demanding the resignation of President Maia Sandu and the Government. The actions of the pro-Western government have caused the highest inflation in Europe, extremely high utility prices for the majority of the population, the practical destruction of relations with Russia, the main supplier of energy resources. Even the representatives of the opposition are ready to forget about their differences and go in a common front, because they understand that Maia Sandu's team led the country towards a catastrophe.
[...]
The protest movement will continue to grow, but it will succeed in obtaining real successes only if the opposition has the ability to unite for the sake of the common goal.
The worst scenario for Moldova will be if the government tries to distract the population with an attack on Transnistria, which Kiev has been provoking for a long time. This will mean the expansion of military actions on the territory of the republic, which may lead to the disintegration of the country and its annexation by Romania. It seems that Maia Sandu and the PAS officials would agree with this scenario""
NARRATIVES: 1. The opposition from the Republic of Moldova unites against the pro-European government, organizing massive protests. 2. The current government from Chisinau, supporting Ukraine, will lead to the disintegration of the country and the union with Romania.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Several protest actions were organized in the Republic of Moldova during the last months in the conditions of increasing inflation, which especially affected the prices of energy resources and food products. The protests intensified in the fall, and starting with September 18, so-called non-stop protests take place. In fact, several hundreds of small tents were placed in the center of Chisinau, and dozens, or sometimes hundreds of people organize so-called ""flashmobs"". The larger protests, which according to the police involve several thousand people and, according to according to the organizers, several tens of thousands, take place on Sundays, starting with September 18.
The protests of the last few weeks were organized by the Sor Party, the formation created and led by the oligarch-politician Ilan Sor, considered to be the main executor of the large-scale bank fraud of 2014. He was sentenced to 7 years and six months in the first instance, but his file is moving to the Court of Appeal. In the meantime, he was the mayor of Orhei, and since 2019 he is a deputy, a mandate that he still exercises today, even if he fled the Republic of Moldova and has been hiding in Israel since June 2019.
The protests organized by the Sor party intensified after the arrest and detention of the party's vice-president, Marina Tauber, a close relative of Ilan Sor, but also following the searches of several activists of the party, in a file regarding the illegal financing of the party .
The protests are presented by some Russian media institutions as massive and far-reaching, and the Sor Party, with 6 deputies out of 101, as the main opposition force.
OBJECTIVE: To present the protests organized by the Sor Party as a massive action, widely supported by the opposition and society, against the pro-European government.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In fact, the ""massive protests"" take place on Sundays, for 2-3 hours, and the rest of the time, several dozen protesters ""work"" in tents set up in the center of Chisinau, on the sidewalk between the Presidency and Parliament. It is true that on Sunday, October 9, the organizers announced that they also extended them on the road. The press has repeatedly written that many protesters are brought by special transports and paid for by the Sor Party. The Garda newspaper published an investigation in which three reporters of the institution infiltrated the protesters and received money (approximately 20 euros each) for participating in a protest action. They were offered 200 dollars for two nights in tents.
Neither did the coagulation of the opposition around the protest movement succeed, as the Russian press claims. Even if the use of party symbols was avoided, other important political formations did not join the protests organized by the Sor Party, a political formation considered ""toxic"". Moreover, in the last days the misunderstandings in the Bloc became more and more visible communists and socialists, the main opposition force. After several exchanges of words between the representatives of the formations, last week the communists published a statement in which they accused the former PSRM leader, Igor Dodon, of corruption and betrayal. In the reply, the socialists accused communists that divides the opposition and warns that they will make public the real reasons for this behavior.
And other messages sent in the article about the blame that the Chisinau government bears for the price increase, the violation of neutrality by granting assistance to Ukraine, the intention of the authorities to ""put on the tray"" the Republic of Moldova to Romania are theses often promoted by Russian propaganda with the aim of to erode the confidence of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova in the government, but also to show it as a potential danger for Russia.

Although statistically speaking, in this case the incidence of the disease is four times higher than normal, the experts have not established until the time of publication of the article a common cause of the disease in the four young athletes. In addition, it is not even known whether or not they are vaccinated against Covid19.
NEWS: ""The German sports world is in shock: Four players from Germany have testicular cancer. Terrifying, four footballers, all diagnosed with the same type of cancer.
ActiveNews has warned since June 2021 that the spike protein of the Pfizer ""vaccine"" can affect the ovaries and testicles, according to a confidential Japanese study.
The ""spike"" protein of the antiCovid19 vaccine enters the bloodstream, which can explain thousands of adverse effects, from blood clots and heart disease to brain damage and reproductive problems.""
NARRATIVE: Vaccination against the coronavirus causes testicular cancer and leads to infertility.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Ever since the beginning of the Covid19 pandemic, a series of false narratives have appeared in Romania regarding the nature and origin of the SARS-CoV2 virus, the measures taken to combat its spread, or the effectiveness and effects of vaccination. Among the promoters of these false narratives are supporters of conspiracy theories, radical Orthodox, sovereignists, Euro-skeptics, anti-Westerners, dacoits and Kremlin spokesmen. In support of the statements made, Activenews.ro does not present even one medical proof. They also seek to validate their theories through pseudo-experts, anonymous websites or by falsely quoting various studies.
Veridica has already dismantled several fake news and misinformation about the antiCovid19 vaccine, that it would cause sterility for three generations or that it would not be effective and would have serious adverse effects.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the anti-vaccine culture and inducing fear among those who get vaccinated against Covid19 or who would intend to get vaccinated.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Without having any evidence in this regard, the author of the article induces from the title the idea that the illness of the four footballers would have occurred due to the vaccination against Covid19. In reality, it is not known until the publication date of the article, neither if the four athletes were vaccinated against Covid19 nor the exact cause of the appearance of testicular cancer in the four particular cases.
With all the current scientific advances, the exact cause of testicular cancer (a disease manifested by the development of abnormal cells in the testicular tissue, with increased-chaotic reproductive potential, which the body is not able to limit through physiological processes) is still unknown. Scientists have identified over time several factors likely to cause this disease: cryptorchidism (undescended testicle), inguinal hernia, family history, Klinefelter's syndrome and ""supermale"" syndrome (genetic diseases) or irradiation of the area But, although these conditions can increase the risk of the disease, they are not mandatory, nor are they the basis of most testicular cancers.
What we know for sure, however, is that the appearance of testicular cancer in athletes is not new, on the contrary, it is a phenomenon studied for a long time by doctors. There are already several theories related to the subject, such as that of the urologist Frank Sommer, a professor at the University of Hamburg, who states that boys who intensively practice various sports before puberty have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer, regardless with genetic factors. One of the causes taken into consideration by the renowned German doctor is the extreme sensitivity of the intimate area to sudden and radical changes in body temperature, caused by physical exertion. However, the studies related to this theory are still in the early stages and it will take many years until a scientifically valid conclusion is reached.
The Japanese ""confidential"" study to which the material in question refers is actually the fragment of the pharmacokinetic study of the research related to the antiCovid19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. It followed, after vaccination, the path in the body of the fat particles that contain the genetic sequence of RNA spike protein messenger Without it being a secret at all, the entire study was validated by the European Medicines Agency as early as February 2021.
Apart from the study conducted by Pfizer, which could reasonably be suspected of subjectivity and manipulation of the results, several doctors and scientists have researched the same thing, and their conclusions coincided with those of the vaccine manufacturer: the spike protein is harmless, it only stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies.

""Back in the USSR"" propaganda in HD format
euvsdisinfo.eu / September 27, 2022, 1tv.ru / September 25, 2022
If President Putin's speech seems disconnected from reality, watching the news programs of the televisions controlled by the Kremlin leaves the viewer more and more informed with the feeling of entering a parallel world. The more serious and tense the topics of the day become - from the referendums in the separatist regions to the military mobilization and the critical situation on the front -, the more obviously the content of the broadcasts is subordinated to propaganda indications. The euvsdisinfo portal came to the conclusion that, on September 25, Channel 1 of the state television detached itself in the tight disinformation competition with the stations Rossiya 1 and Rossiya 24. Of the more than two hours allocated to the weekly synthesis show ""Voskresnoe Vremea"" - Ora from Sunday, 25 minutes went to the referendums in the so-called Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, as well as those in the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions. The main message: the prosperity that will be enjoyed by the many residents who would have taken storm the polling centers. Optimism was maintained by the insertion of recorded interventions with President Putin, who promised that Russia would not leave these regions in the hands of the ""neo-Nazis from Kiev"", being obliged to respect the popular will. The international reactions to the annexation, be they from Kiev, from the UN or from Beijing, are completely missing.
The subject of the partial mobilization announced by the authorities occupied 15 minutes. Patriots in power, calm and with a confident air waiting patiently in line to go to the front. Many of them volunteers, viewers are told. The completion of the formalities is done in an orderly manner, stimulated by the prospect of substantial salaries. The proud families say goodbye to the recruits. In a short interview, the Russian Minister of Defense gives assurances that the mobilization is going ""like clockwork"". The enlistment of the son of the political leader in Crimea is given as an example - in fact, a bold attempt to counter the effects of the prank, which has gone viral, in which the son of the the Kremlin's spokesman arrogantly refuses an alleged telephone summons to the police station staged by opposition activists. The positive, bright tone is overshadowed only by the legal statement that evading military service or desertion is punishable by 10 years in prison. Instead , not a word about the protests against mobilization from the entire Federation, nor about the violent clashes with the police. Not a word about the kilometer-long queues at the borders, an unprecedented exodus of Russians who fear becoming ""cannon fodder"". And there is no mention of the dismissal ""on the spot"" of the Deputy Minister of Defense, considered guilty for the considerable logistical problems of the Russian army. On the contrary, for the producers of the show, Ukraine has already been defeated, a right for which they emphasize with satisfaction, price of 15 minutes, as how high is the morale of the troops and how resounding are the successes on the front. A few generic images with explosions, a hand of soldiers apparently in combat gear and the confident statement of a battalion commander are considered sufficient. Several Ukrainian prisoners declare, visibly timid, that they are well treated - another visible attempt to counter the information regarding the miserable treatment of those who fell into captivity, such as the United Nations Report on the Russian sorting and detention camps. In fact, the five minutes dedicated in the show to the recent exchange of prisoners with the enemy Ukrainian shows the 55 Russian soldiers happy to have returned home and showing incomparably better physical condition than the Ukrainian prisoners released after their capture at the Azovstal factories. The reports, videos and comments broadcast in the next 25 minutes of the show try to convince Russian viewers that the West is in decline, but still remains dangerous. The materials pick up on favorite themes from the Kremlin's disinformation manual. The United States represents the ""brain"" of the actions of the European Union and Ukraine, even of all the countries that would have ""ceded"" their sovereignty. All these countries rallied to NATO's plans to attack Russia, like Hitler and the Nazis, but much more treacherously because their aggression is facilitated by the guerilla groups they sponsor in Russia. Moscow remains devoted to the defense of the world order and the protector of the helpless, while Europe is on the verge of collapse as a consequence of its own sanctions imposed on Russia. To complete the image of the alleged decadence of the West, the show announces that most Europeans are in the street, protesting against the power cut and the food shortage. All, of course, in contrast to the news of the budget proposal for 2023 of the Russian government, which does not show the faces, to cover all social obligations. In other words, the citizens have reasons to be grateful for the stable life in Putin's Russia, safe from the turbulent and unpredictable life of Europeans who have lost their moral and material values. The conclusion of the euvsdisinfo analyst after watching this manipulation exercise is that there are only two notable differences between the recent broadcast of the Moscow state television and similar programs from the USSR period. The first is strictly technological: unlike communism, the Kremlin's televised propaganda today benefits from the HD format. The second difference concerns the identity of the wise and indisputable leader, the guarantor of the good of the nation. In the Soviet era, he was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Today he is Vladimir Putin.
""Saint"" Putin at war with the ""satanic"" West
youtube.com/kremlin/videos - Oct. 1 2022, euobserver.com / Sep 30 2022
The lavish ceremony dedicated to Russia's annexation of four southeastern Ukrainian regions was for President Vladimir Putin the occasion of a paroxysmal indictment of the West. In the speech with delirious accents and sprinkled with biblical references, Putin described the officialization of the territorial rapture as part of a ""holy war against the Western countries which, besides supporting Nazi Ukraine, want the ""colonization"" of Russia. The climax of the monologue was the Kremlin leader's invocation of Jesus Christ as a ""witness"" of the justice of his actions. Moreover, the president of the Russian Federation assumed the messianic role of defender of Christianity and savior of the fundamental values ​​from which - he claims - the western countries would have abdicated, openly adopting ""Satanism"". Putin accused ""the elites Western"" as promoting sexual deviations among children, thus preparing them for possible sex change operations. ""We are fighting for historical Russia and to protect our children and grandchildren from this experiment meant to change their souls"", Putin said to the applause of those present, adding that he is confident in the ""spiritual power of the Russian people"", whose ""suffering"" shares them. Analysts from the publication euobserver noted that the mystical tone of Putin's plea contrasts with the justification of the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, when the Russian president invoked only historical arguments. On the other hand, the phantasmagorias about the so-called ""Satanism "" that Westerners would be possessed by, as well as the incitement to hatred on sexual grounds are already familiar themes in the Kremlin's propaganda. However, writes euobserver, the unique mixture of religion, sex and geopolitics in the apocalyptic speech delivered by Vladimir Putin on Friday is, by far, the most toxic of all his public interventions so far.

In reality, Ukraine does not produce dirty bombs, nor does it intend to attack its own population, while nuclear blackmail is increasingly present in the speeches of Russian politicians.
NEWS: ""The sabotage that caused three leaks at the Nord Stream gas pipeline is just a test. The Americans are preparing future terrorist acts on Russian territory, which will involve the destruction of large infrastructure targets,"" the political scientist said live on Russia 1 Dmitri Evstafiev, quoted by the PolitNavigator correspondent.
""I have no doubt that Zelenski already ordered the production of a dirty bomb and its use, most likely, in the southern direction. I think that this dirty bomb will be used by Ukraine in the coming weeks. We will have to stop hiding our heads in the sand and stop saying that we were not notified. We must be prepared for the use by the Kiev regime of the dirty bomb on the regions that are reuniting with Russia,"" said Evstafiev.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine will use a ""dirty"" radiological bomb in the south of the country.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, only Russia can use a nuclear bomb or a ""dirty"" bomb. Both the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, various parliamentarians or governors have blackmailed Ukraine and the West several times, threatening the use of nuclear weapons. Even during the signing ceremony of the ""unification agreement with Russia"" of the regions illegally annexed by the Russian army, Putin alluded to the American precedent of using the nuclear bomb during the Second World War World. In fact, since the beginning of the regime, Putin or other Moscow officials have made multiple references to Russia's nuclear arsenal, they have talked about using it to defend Russia's territory (which, in their view, includes the illegally annexed regions), and the leader Chechen Ramzan Kadyrov, a close associate of Putin, explicitly called for the bombing of Ukraine with tactical nuclear weapons.
The dirty bomb or radiological weapon combines radioactive material with conventional explosives, with the aim of radioactive contamination in the dispersion area of ​​the conventional explosive agent. This type of bomb - which until now has not been used - came to attention in the context of the terrorist attacks committed by Al Qaeda, when concerns arose that the jihadist group could try to manufacture a dirty bomb.
Kiev does not have any program to produce nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, a fact confirmed by a report by the UN High Representative for disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsu. At the same time, terrorist activity or intentional pollution of the environment is prohibited by law. Ukraine directly assumes, by law no. 25 of 2003, to combat and prevent technological terrorism, which includes the use of any type of bombs.
At the same time, Ukraine does not recognize Russia's annexation of the regions in the east and south of the country, and the use of a radiological weapon on these territories, especially in the context of a successful offensive both in the south and in the east, seems devoid of any logic and it goes against the military doctrine of Ukraine. Kiev has no interest in bombing and attacking the Ukrainian population in the south of the country with radiological or other weapons. The Ukrainian citizens there are waiting for liberation, opposing the invasion of the Russian occupation from the very beginning through rallies, protests, blockades, etc.
The narrative in question is a continuation of the classic metanarrative regarding the genocide of the Russian-speaking population of Donbass, which, apparently, is carried out by Kiev through terrorist methods. The dirty bomb, in fact, is a tool of the groups that apply terror to the population. According to analytical reports, these bombs are intended to induce fear, sow panic and discourage the defensive or offensive efforts of the enemy. The purpose of distributing this narrative is to accustom the public opinion in Russia to the idea that a nuclear disaster could occur in the south of Ukraine, but not through the fault of Russia, but of Kiev, supported by the West.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding an alleged danger of Ukraine causing a nuclear incident. The Russian press wrote that the IAEA mission praised the Russian army for defending the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant from Ukrainian bombings. In August, the Russian press wrote that at the behest of the US, Kiev will cause a nuclear disaster in Zaporizhia, following another false narrative, according to which an explosion will be caused to hide the traces of American biological weapons laboratories.

The main allies of the Nazis, Italy and Japan, are missing from the list. In fact, it is another crude attempt to force the justification of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, by falsely quoting and manipulatively interpreting several treaties and documents subsequent to the Second World War.
NEWS: ""UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was surprised to learn from Vladimir Putin that there is an article in the UN Charter that allows a special Russian operation to be carried out in Ukraine. Putin tried in December 2021 at the UN Security Council to obtain the condemnation of Nazism in eastern Ukraine, and thus if the United Nations had decided on this fact, the invasion could have been stopped. Western member countries did not vote for the resolution, which was instead approved by China and India. Vladimir Putin then invoked the UN Charter, but no one knew what he was referring to
[...]
If all the articles cited in the UN Charter and the Declaration of the Four Nations are put together, then Russia, being the legal successor of the USSR, can also use force against the states that want to revise the Yalta-Potsdam system in Europe""
NARRATIVES: 1. The UN Charter allows Russia to invade Ukraine to fight Nazism. 2. The war in Ukraine broke out because the West blocked the condemnation of Nazism in the UN Security Council.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The narrative appeared in an online publication and on the website of a well-known extreme right-wing anti-Semitic nationalist, former PCR secretary at Bucharest University and collaborator of the Foreign Information Center within the Security. It is not the first time that the UN is invoked regarding the war in Ukraine. At the beginning of the Russian invasion, there was a fake news about the non-recognition of the current borders of Ukraine by the UN, followed by the statement of the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, that Donbass, Zaporizhia, Kherson have the right to self-determination according to the UN Charter.
OBJECTIVE: justification of the Russian invasion of Ukraine through the lens of international law.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE:
Invoked by the author in the material, the Moscow Declaration of 1943 makes absolutely no reference to the UN Charter, since it was only signed in 1945, nor to the Nuremberg Tribunal, also established in 1945. In fact, the chapter from the said declaration regarding the Nazis, it states that the Germans guilty of atrocities and war crimes should be arrested and sent to the states where they committed those crimes, where they would be judged by the peoples they oppressed. In the case of Germans whose crimes could not be located concretely from a geographical point of view, they had to be tried and condemned by a joint decision of the Allied governments.
In developing the theory, the author of the material also states that the Institute for the Study of WAR (ISW) commented that articles 106 and 107 of the UN Charter give the right to any of the winning allies of the world conflagration (USA, UK, USSR, France and China) to invade any other country declared defeated, if it aims to review the results of the Second World War. The link included in the article, however, only leads to the page where the analysis of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is made, and nowhere does the institute's specialists show any opinion regarding the UN Charter or Russia's right to invade any of the countries mentioned in the article. ""For this, it is enough to announce the other three winning countries, but not to obtain their approval"", the article also states. In fact, article 106 stipulates as clearly as possible that ""the parties... will consult between them and, if necessary, with other Members of the United Nations..., to undertake, on behalf of the Organization, any common actions that might be necessary to maintain international peace and security."" Article 107 really says that ""no provision of this Charter shall affect or prohibit, against a State which during the Second World War was the enemy of any of the signatories of this Charter, an action taken or authorized, as a result of this war, by the governments responsible for this action."", but he was referring to a situation existing at that time, with the allied troops present on the territory of the defeated states. In a broader interpretation, it refers to actions against the allied states Hitler's Germany, which contested diplomatically or through armed actions the treaties concluded after World War II. Or in the current case, Ukraine did not contest anything, especially since, at that time, it was part of the USSR, so it was practically in the camp of the victors.
Regarding the resolution blocked by the West in the UN Security Council, there was indeed a resolution on ""Combating the glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance."" associated with them"", but this was proposed to the UN General Assembly. The United States, Ukraine and Palau voted against the resolution, while the Western allies of Washington and Kiev abstained. The US explained that, although it condemned Nazism and any form of racism, xenophobia, discrimination and intolerance, did not vote for the UN General Assembly resolution because, among other things, it represents ""a blatant attempt to legitimize Russia's disinformation campaigns that denigrate neighboring nations and promote a distorted Soviet narrative about a large part of contemporary European history, cynically using the pretext of fighting the glorification of Nazism"".
In fact, just a few months after the vote on the resolution - which was adopted by the UN General Assembly - Russia invaded Ukraine using precisely the pretext of its ""denazification"". Moscow's claims regarding the Nazis taking control of Ukraine have been dismantled repeatedly - even if in Ukraine (as in most European states) there are groups and parties of the extreme right, they have never been in government and did not even get enough votes to reach the Parliament in the last elections.

The media institution, subordinate to the Kremlin, suggests that the current ""regime"" from Chisinau, which transforms the country into a ""Ukraine in miniature"", will be able to be removed once the Russian army approaches the borders of the Republic of Moldova.

[...]
The Russophobic regime in the Republic of Moldova will continue to fortify itself and turn the country into a miniature Ukraine. At least until the time when the Russian armies participating in the special operation will not approach the borders of the Republic of Moldova"" NARRATIVES: 1. The Republic of Moldova is ruled by an authoritarian regime, totally subject to the West and Russophobic. 2. A Russian military intervention would also be justified in the Republic of Moldova, considering the internal developments in this country
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Russian military invasion in Ukraine also caused the intensification of the messages promoted by the Russian media about the existence of a dictatorial/fascist/Russophobic regime in the Republic of Moldova, suggesting the need for the ""denazification"" of the Republic of Moldova after Ukraine. The impasse of the Russian army in Ukraine diluted by the press from the Kremlin, but the messages were taken over by the Sor Party, which has been organizing protests in Chisinau for the last few weeks. With the launch of the protests, Russian media institutions are urging the Kremlin to take more decisive actions against the Republic of Moldova, such as the recognition of the independence of Transnistria.
OBJECTIVE: To present the government in Chisinau as a dictatorial, Russophobic regime, thus justifying tougher pressures or interventions by Moscow.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: From the beginning of the invasion from Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova condemned the Russian military intervention, but did not get involved in the conflict. He also did not accept the proposal reiterated by several representatives of Kiev regarding an intervention in the Transnistrian separatist region against the Russian military contingent and the separatist forces subordinate to Tiraspol.
Politnavigator exaggerates the quasi-total control that PAS would have in the Republic of Moldova. After decisive victories in the presidential (Maia Sandu, then PAS leader, position she had to give up as president) and legislative elections, PAS was able to form the government and appoint its people to lead numerous institutions, but this does not mean that the respective institutions are controlled at all levels, or that in any institution purges of those who have other preferences/political connections took place. Moreover, government representatives and independent experts mention the influence of several oligarchic and criminal groups on the justice system in the Republic of Moldova.
The establishment of censorship and the banning of the Russian press is another topic intensively promoted by Russian propaganda. In fact, the authorities in Chisinau took several measures, in the last months, after the Russian invasion, against propaganda and disinformation, but they were not directed strictly against the media from Russia or from another country. The law prohibiting the broadcast of certain categories of broadcasts on TV refers to a certain category of states - those that have not ratified the European Convention on cross-border television. SIS also blocked websites in Romanian and Russian, just as the Audiovisual Council warned and fined both Romanian and Russian language stations.
The Republic of Moldova rose in the Press Freedom Index, developed by the international organization Reporters Without Borders (RFF), from 89th place in 2021 to 40th place this year.
President Maia Sandu and PAS have always declared in favor of the European integration of the Republic of Moldova, the messages being interpreted by pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau and the Kremlin-served press as proof of Chisinau's total submission to Western interests, but they were never brought evidence in this sense.

In reality, there was no question of organizing any referendum in Lviv, and Poland is a vocal supporter of Ukraine and its territorial integrity.
NEWS: ""Preparations have begun for the organization of a referendum on the annexation of the Ukrainian region of Lviv to Poland. The ballots in Ukrainian with the Polish stamp have already arrived in the region.
Such a referendum could be predicted in the context of the unprecedented intensification of military and civil cooperation between Ukraine and Poland.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, told the Polish leader Andrzej Duda on September 22 that he is ready to organize referendums in the regions of Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankovsk to join these territories to Poland, former deputy of the Supreme Rada Ilia Kiva writes on his channel Telegram.
[...]
The Verkhovna Rada adopted a law equalizing the rights of Poles and Ukrainians. It is assumed that the Ukrainian authorities accepted this bill in exchange for the supply of fuel and weapons.""
NARRATIVE: A referendum for joining Poland will be organized in the Lviv region.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, in the Lviv region there are no preparations for holding a referendum on joining Poland, and the information about the ballot papers stamped by the Polish authorities and Zelenski's promise to allow the annexation is a fabrication.
The news is based on a post on Telegram by former Ukrainian parliamentarian Ilia Kiva, a member of some pro-Kremlin parties, who fled to Russia at the very beginning of the large-scale invasion of Ukraine. Being on the territory of Russia, Kiva would have confirmed that Zelensky is ready ""to organize referendums in Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankovsk regions"".
On the official pages of the Polish and Ukrainian presidents, in the Ukrainian or international press, we do not find any information about such a discussion between Zelenski and Duda. Ilia Kiva is wanted internationally by Ukraine for supporting separatism and collaborating with Russia.
Referendums of this kind are prohibited by the legislation in force in Ukraine, something reiterated by Kiev in the context in which Moscow orchestrated so-called popular consultations in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporozhye and Kherson. These were also condemned by Poland, and the country's president, Andrzej Duda, declared that fake referendums have nothing in common with democracy.
According to Article 73 of the Constitution of Ukraine, territorial changes can be the subject of a national referendum. So, local or regional referendums do not legally change the territorial ownership of some Ukrainian regions.
On September 29, the secretary of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland, Stanislaw Zaryn, wrote on Twitter that ""Russian propaganda continues to attack Poland with information, repeating the lie about the plans of the Polish authorities to attack Ukraine and annex the Ukrainian west""
The purpose of this narrative is to justify in the eyes of the Russian community the organization of fake referendums in the south and east of Ukraine, as a result of which part of four Ukrainian regions were illegally annexed by Russia. Also, the aim is to exonerate Russia by transferring the blame to Ukraine's neighbors, who, apparently, seek to divide the Ukrainian state.
Poland was the most vocal and active of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts, becoming a target of Russian propaganda. The Polish leaders support Ukraine and declare that the territorial integrity of the neighboring state is very important for the international law system.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding Poland's ""desire"" to annex Ukrainian territories. The Russian media wrote that Warsaw will start a war against Moscow in the next 10 years, while the majority of Poles support the invasion of the western regions Ukraine. A series of false narratives appeared after Sergei Nariskin, the head of Russian espionage, accused Poland of wanting to take over its ""historical territories"" from Ukraine, using the weakening of the Ukrainian state. According to Russian propaganda, the President of Poland admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories, and Kiev would have allowed 10 thousand soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country.

It is not a bluff,"" Putin said in his televised statement. In the Russian arsenal there are long-range missiles, Iskander, 12,400 tanks, 3,391 missile launchers (the USA has only 1,366, according to Global Fire), 30,122 armored cars (USA, 45,193), transcontinental ballistic missiles, Sarmat 1 and Sarmat 2 , called ""Satan"" by Westerners, 81 submarines with a nuclear load, distributed in the seas and oceans of the world, the Zircons, anti-ship hypersonic cruise missiles, a flotilla of fighter planes in Kaliningrad and a naval one. FSB special troops can be added to these at any time. Russia can mobilize up to 23 million reservists. In the words of a friend from the army, ""once they are fired, they don't just stop in London"". Does the West want a new world conflagration? Then, all he has to do is send NATO troops to Crimea. Putin is waiting for the little Yankees.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The West attacked Yugoslavia to support secessionism, but denies the right to self-determination of the population of four Ukrainian regions where referendums were held. 2. Referendums in Donbass, Kherson and Zaporizhia are legal. 3. The West is a hypocrite because it recognized Kosovo's right to self-determination, but it does not recognize that of the regions in Ukraine.
CONTEXT: Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 after pro-Europeans came to power in Kiev and the pro-Russian regime of Viktor Yanukovych was removed. The pretexts invoked by Russia - that in Ukraine the extreme right took over the leadership through a coup d'état - proved to be false; in fact, the aggression was caused by the Vladimir Putin regime's fear of the establishment of a pro-Western liberal democracy near its borders and Moscow's determination to keep Ukraine in what it considers to be its sphere of influence. In 2022, Russia launched a new invasion, the pretext being a non-existent expansion of NATO to the east; the new war has all the characteristics of an imperial war of conquest, as demonstrated by the large scale of the attack, which initially targeted the capital Kiev as well.
The Russian army proved to be unable to defeat the Ukrainian forces, despite years of propaganda regarding the training of its military and the advanced weaponry it would have at its disposal. The blitzkrieg that should have quickly destroyed Ukraine proved to be a failure, the advancing Russian forces being stopped and suffering heavy losses on all fronts; the loss of the battle of Kiev followed and the first great retreat of the Russians. Some victories - in Mariupol, in Donbass - were obtained extremely hard, with great losses and only after the almost complete destruction of some cities that had been defended by Ukrainian forces clearly inferior numerically and in terms of equipment.
In September, however, Ukraine managed to launch a lightning offensive in the Kharkiv area, after which it captured thousands of square kilometers in just a few days, and another, slower one, in the Kherson region, which threatens the Russian positions there. With the prospect of new catastrophic defeats, Moscow organized emergency referendums on the annexation of four Ukrainian regions threatened by Kiev's counter-offensive - Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia; just a few days after the announcement of the referendums, they were organized, without having been practically prepared, the results were announced immediately and after a short time the legal steps for annexation were taken. In parallel with the organization of the referendums, Moscow threatened that, once the respective regions are part of Russia, it will be able to use nuclear weapons for their defense. Practically, in the face of a humiliating defeat, the Putin regime looked for a method to be able to intimidate Kiev and force it to stop using its army and imagined the solution of these referendums.
OBJECTIVE: To legitimize some of Russia's abusive actions in Ukraine in front of public opinion by invoking a so-called ""popular will"". Perpetuating the false image of a strong and superior Russian army not only to Ukraine's, but also to NATO forces.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The comparison between the referendums in Ukraine and the one organized in Yugoslavia in 1998 is baseless. The referendum in Yugoslavia was not about the autonomy and independence of Kosovo and, moreover, it was boycotted by the Albanians of this province; the two situations could have been compared if a referendum was organized in the free Ukraine in which the population could decide on the four regions partially occupied by Russia.
On the other hand, Russia is trying to argue its territorial annexations from Ukraine, namely the Crimean peninsula in 2014, through the lens of what Moscow calls ""the Kosovo precedent"". First of all, Russia itself is the one that does not officially recognize a previous Kosovo. As the main supporter of Serbia, Moscow refused to recognize the independence of this region. It was proclaimed in 2008, 9 years after the war, and until now it has not been recognized by all states of the world (not even by all countries EU members), Kosovo not being, for this reason, a member of the UN or other international organizations.
Kosovo's struggle for independence began in 1989, when the government in Belgrade revoked, on March 23, 1989, the statute granting autonomy to Kosovo. The other two big events that opened the way to independence many years later from the Kosovo problem took place in July 1990 and September 1991 by eliminating the political institutions in the province and proclaiming a ""Republic of Kosovo"", and in February 1996 the first attacks of The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).The NATO intervention in 1999 was launched in the context in which a policy of ethnic cleansing was in full swing in Kosovo and there was evidence of massacres committed against civilians, for whose protection it intervened.
In the four Ukrainian regions, on the other hand, the referendums were held under conditions of Russian occupation, with a large part of the population absent because they had taken refuge from the Russians or live in areas under the control of Ukrainian forces. Numerous images and reports from the scene show that the vote took place, practically, under the threat of weapons, the teams at the polls being accompanied by armed Russian soldiers with hoods. There were also no independent international observers. For all these reasons, no international organization recognized the pseudo-referendums in the four Ukrainian regions.
As for the Russian occupation, it occurred after a classic war of imperial conquest, the population of the area not being the target of any purge or persecution campaign of the Kiev regime that would have justified its protection; on the contrary, the large wave of refugees and civil resistance in several localities show that an important part of the population in the 4 regions identifies as Ukrainian. Also, until 2014, when Russia launched the first invasion of Ukraine and the so-called ""green men"" - actually Russian agents - launched separatist movements in Donetsk and Luhansk, there was no pro-independence movement in those two regions, neither in Zaporozhye and Kherson.
The article by Marius Ghilezan from Romania Libera and the rhetoric related to an attack by Russia on Great Britain stands out, just as one of the main propagandists of the Kremlin, the TV presenter from the Russian public television channel, Dmitri, did in May Kiselyov.
""One release, Boris, and England no longer exists. Once and for all"", Kiseliov declared about the dreaded Sarmat nuclear missile, nicknamed Satan 2. ""The explosion of this thermonuclear torpedo close to the shores of Great Britain will raise a huge wave, a tsunami, with a height of up to 500 meters"". the same Kiseliov emphasized"", said the Russian propagandist.
Today, Marius Ghilezan comes with a similar value judgement, overbidding the strength of the Russian army, much lower than the American ones according to the Global Fire Power website which the author quotes truncated.
""The word of a friend from the army, ""these [Russians], once they are aroused, do not stop only in London. Does the West want a new world conflagration? Then, all it has to do is send NATO troops to Crimea. Putin is waiting for the little Yankees "", the journalist Romania Libera wrote in his article.
In fact, Russia is incapable of defeating Ukraine and began to lose ground once Kiev was delivered, in relatively small quantities, high-performance NATO weapons. However, the USA and NATO allies possess a much larger amount of such weapons plus a series of much more advanced systems, so that the war in Ukraine clearly shows that, compared to the West, Russia is a second-rate military power , which would not be able to cope in a conventional confrontation. Hence Moscow's rhetoric regarding its nuclear arsenal, the only one with which it can threaten the West.
In fact, Russia repeatedly uses this threat of its weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, with the dissuasive aim of discouraging the will of the West to stand by Ukraine during this Russian invasion. It should be noted, however, that even in such a scenario, the nuclear arsenal of the USA and other Western states, somewhat more modern than that of Russia, guarantees that even in the case of such a confrontation, a victory is impossible for the Putin regime, which can obtain the much mutual destruction, which is not to anyone's advantage.

In reality, the Western states did not send observers to the so-called referendums, and the ""experts"" cited by the Russian press were born in the West, but have lived in Russia for many years and support the Kremlin's policies.
NEWS: ""The international observers declared that they did not observe any violations during the referendum [...]
Independent political analyst from France Moro Xavier Bernard, who monitored how refugees vote on the territory of Russia, but also in the People's Republic of Donetsk, said that Kiev continues to bomb Donetsk on the day of the vote. Therefore, people were afraid to participate. ""I saw how refugees vote. Everything reminded me of France, everything was fine"".
[...]
The Italian diplomat Vito Grittani, founder of the International Diplomatic Observatory, registered at the socio-economic department of the UN NGO, also said that the referendum took place in accordance with international standards.
""At the referendum, the general rules were respected, there were no cases of refusal to issue ballots in any of the polling stations, there were no cases of issuing ballots without presenting an identity card or a document that to replace him, there were no problems with access to the voting place. There were no registered cases of multiple voting, there was no pressure on the participants in the referendum or ignorance of the voting procedure by the citizens,"" said the diplomat.
NARRATIVE: Observers from the West confirm that the referendums in Donbass, Kherson and Zaporizhia respected democratic standards.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, observers from Western states did not participate in the pseudo-referendums in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporozhye and Kherson. Both the EU member countries and the USA have clearly said that they will never recognize the referendums, both before and during their development, as well as after the announcement of the results by Moscow.
According to the Ukrainian government, only a few states - most of them authoritarian and/or partners with Moscow - sent observers to the fake referendums in eastern and southern Ukraine: Belarus, Syria, Egypt, Brazil, Venezuela, Uruguay, Togo and South Africa. Therefore, Italy, France, Germany and other Western countries did not send observers and do not recognize these fake referendums as legitimate.
The news published by RIA NOVOSTI is based on a series of false information. Moro Xavier Bernard is not an independent French expert, but a businessman, originally from France, who has been living on the territory of Russia for more than 20 years. He wrote philosophy books in which he praises Vladimir Putin, knows the Russian language, collaborates with the institutions of the Russian state. In other words, he is not an international observer, he does not represent France, but he is a Russian resident with French origins.
Vito Grittani is presented as an Italian diplomat, but he has been living in Russia for several years, has the citizenship of the separatist region of Abkhazia and is its ""Ambassador Plenipotentiary"", and in 2019 the Russian press wrote about his visit to the Transnistrian region as ""Ambassador plenipotentiary"" of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Abkhazia, as stated on its website, in an article dedicated to Grittani's visit to another separatist republic supported by Moscow, Transnistria.
The press from Abkhazia presents Grittani as a local diplomat who fights for the interests of the separatist republic.
Therefore, the people who praised the ""democratic way"" of conducting the fake referendums in the east and south of Ukraine are not international observers, they did not represent Western states, they have been living on the territory of Russia for many years and constantly support the separatist projects of the Kremlin in the post-soviet space.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that aim to legitimize Russia's actions on the territory of Ukraine. The Russian press also wrote that the referendums on joining Russia of the territories in the east and south of Ukraine respect the UN Charter, while the inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region are waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis. Russian propaganda shows that the UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control Ukraine's seaports, and the south of Ukraine, freed from nationalists, wants to be annexed to Russia.

In reality, these restrictions have been canceled for some time by the current Italian government.
NEWS: ,,Giorgia Meloni, president of the Brothers of Italy, gives ground to the left and the Covid Dictatorship. The traditional right-wing formation of the Brothers of Italy has promised to put an end to the Dictatorship of Vaccination and the ""Green"" Certificates of discrimination against the unvaccinated. Also on the agenda of Giorgia Meloni's party is a Commission of Inquiry to evaluate the management of the pandemic. Let us learn too from our Romanian brothers.
Ursula von der Leyen threatened the Italians to ""be careful how they vote"", otherwise Italy will be sanctioned. It seems that the Italians followed her advice and voted with the utmost care to get rid of the Covid Dictatorship. ""
NARRATIVES: 1. The peoples of Europe wake up to reality and put an end to the health dictatorship of the eco-Marxist left. 2. Countries that do not vote according to EU ""directives"" are threatened with drastic sanctions.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: After Sweden, the conservative right won the elections with a relative majority in Italy as well. With Hungary and Poland already dominated by Eurosceptic right-wing political forces, the victory of the ""Brothers of Italy"" party is seen as another step towards a sovereign Europe that will lead to the demise of the EU. The article in question, along with others on the same topic, appeared on activenews.ro, an online publication that in recent years has promoted numerous false narratives regarding the coronavirus pandemic, but also on political issues.
OBJECTIVE: Fueling sovereignist, anti-EU and anti-NATO themes, inducing the idea that it is time for Romania to take this step as well.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Italy probably has the most turbulent political history of all the EU states. In the 75 years since the adoption of the new Constitution, the Italians have been led by no less than 66 governments. Out of a collective fear of not repeating the mistakes of the past and bringing back to power extremist political formations (either right-wing fascists or left-wing communists), until 1994 the Italians always voted for a centrist coalition led by the Christian Democracy party.
But after Operation Clean Hands, Italy was led in several rows by coalitions of right-wing parties, such as Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia or Matteo Salvini's Northern League. From this it follows that it is not the first time that a party ""gives ground"" to the Italian left.
Returning to the main idea of ​​the article, the cancellation of the restrictions imposed by the Covid19 pandemic, in Italy they have been canceled since the spring of this year, as follows: starting with May 1, 2022, the Italian authorities canceled the obligation to present the vaccination certificate for access to restaurants, shops And so on and at the same time they gave up the request to complete the European Digital Passenger Locator Form. At the same time, from June 1, 2022, it is no longer necessary to present the EU digital certificate to cross the Italian border. The only restriction still in force, which will expire on September 30, is that of wearing a sanitary protection mask in public transport and health institutions.
It is worth noting the transformation of the evil Italians and exploiters of Romanians into ""our Romanian brothers"". The expression is intended to bring the Romanian nationalist-sovereign consciousness closer to the electoral facts of the Italians, and not to glorify any common history of the two peoples, bringing harmony and prosperity.
Before last Sunday's elections, on September 23, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in a statement about the potential new configuration of power in Italy, stated that, ""If things go in the wrong direction, we have tools."" reality, the respective phrase is obviously taken out of context by the author of the article. The entire fragment of the statement is this: ""My approach is that, regardless of the democratic government that is willing to work with us, we work together. If things go - a difficult direction, we have tools (for help/correction - n.r.)"". You can also notice the intentionally wrong translation of difficult in the wrong place instead of difficult.
The statement is later linked to the messages regarding the sanctions on Hungary and Poland coming from Brussels. In reality, the sanctions, meanwhile lifted in the case of Poland, have nothing to do with the political color of the governments in Warsaw and Budapest, but with their policies in matters of corruption, minority rights or decision-making transparency and with the lack of real reforms in justice. And in the case of Hungary, the recovery plan subject to the approval of the European Commission is still unapproved due to several suspicions of fraud with European funds committed by Hungarian officials. But even under these conditions, the European executive is looking for solutions to be able to help the Hungarian state and not block the entire amount requested through the PNRR.

In reality, General Serghei Krivonos spoke about the civilian casualties as a result of the start of Russia's war against Ukraine.
NEWS: Ukraine's losses during the military confrontation with Russia have already reached hundreds of thousands of people, the former deputy secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, the former deputy chief of the Special Operations Forces of Ukraine, General Sergei Krivonos.
The general believes that the civilians have all the credit for not allowing the capitulation of Ukraine. They organized themselves, and the authorities did nothing for this. ""It is our enormous merit and we have the right to tell the authorities: why didn't you do anything, why are there tens, and now even hundreds of thousands of victims, why did they die?""
Krivonos added that Ukraine has lost 20 percent of its territory so far, and the recovery of these lands will cost the state ""tens of thousands of human lives"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine has lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers, according to a general from Kiev.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukrainian General Serghei Krivonos did not talk about the army's losses, but about the civilians killed by the Russian billionaires. The Ukraina.ru portal intentionally misquotes Krivonos, mentions a YouTube channel that interviewed him, but without publishing a hyperlink to make it impossible to verify the information.
Krivonos told the Ukrainian Media Network that Russia killed civilians on the territory of Ukraine and caused enormous destruction. He recalled the tens of thousands of people killed in Mariupol, but also in the Kharkiv and Kiev regions.
""In Mariupol alone, 87,000 people died and I think it is not the final information. Who will explain what happened to them to their relatives and friends, if they are still alive?"" said the Ukrainian general without making any reference in the interview to the losses of the Ukrainian army.
The false narrative regarding the losses has resurfaced from time to time over the past few weeks on Telegram channels and news portals in Russia and the occupied territories to sow panic, discourage Ukrainian resistance and block Kiev's defensive efforts. The title draws attention, which tells the readers about a real catastrophe for the Ukrainian army, while the general did not speak at all about the military losses of his state.
The actual losses of the Ukrainian army in the war are not known. In fact, both sides try to present small figures of their losses. At the end of August, Valeri Zalujni, the Chief of Staff of the Ukrainian Army, declared that Ukraine lost 9 thousand soldiers in the war. In an interview granted to some French publications, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared on September 24 that approximately 50 Ukrainian soldiers die daily, but that these losses would be five times lower than those recorded by Russia. The highest estimates of the Ukrainian side, which appeared during the battle for the Luhansk region, in the summer, were 200 Ukrainians killed per day; even if this level had been maintained throughout the war (but this option is excluded, given that the intensity of the fighting varied), it cannot be about hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers killed, as the Russian government press writes ; at such a level of losses, to which the wounded would be added, the Ukrainian army would no longer exist at this moment. Finally, not only Ukraine but also the West appreciates that Kiev's losses are somewhat lower than those recorded by Moscow's forces. The maximum estimates, which belong to Ukraine, are 57,200 Russians killed, while the Pentagon estimated, at the beginning of August, that the total number of dead and wounded registered by Russia would be up to 80 thousand.
Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives aimed at discouraging Ukrainian resistance in the war. The Russian press wrote, for example, that the EU states will ask Ukraine to yield to Russia, and American scientists support all Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace, while Ukraine is mobilizing a million soldiers, paying with human beings for Western loans.

The source resumes other false narratives regarding the Republic of Moldova and raises the issue of the recognition of the independence of Transnistria by Moscow.
NEWS: ,,As the [telegram] channel <<Kremlevskaia prachka>> [Kremlin Laundry] claims, PAS deputy, controlled by Maia Sandu, Vasile Soimaru has spoken out in favor of offering Transnistria to Ukraine. In other words, to cede the territory of the recognized republic where the operational group of the Russian military forces is deployed.
Washington has been demanding for a long time that the Russian military be evacuated from there. ""We could have ceded the Transnistrian region to Ukraine, asking for historical Bessarabia and Bucovina as far as Chernivtsi in return,"" said the deputy.
By the way, at the beginning of September, the former commander of the US armies in Europe, Ben Hodges, said, ""The time has probably come for Ukraine and Moldova to solve the Transnistrian problem."" The Kremlin can't mess them up right now.""
[...]
Neutrality consists in the full support of Ukraine and the use of Moldova as a transit point for Western weapons and wounded Ukrainian soldiers.
[...]
Maybe the time has come for Russia to finally recognize Transnistria, without waiting for missiles to fly from Moldova?""
NARRATIVES: 1. The Republic of Moldova is ready to cede Transnistria through an exchange of territories with Ukraine. 2. The Republic of Moldova got involved in the war on the side of Ukraine, violating the status of neutrality. 3. Russia should recognize the independence of Transnistria.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is the de facto successor of a state created by the USSR in 1940, after the occupation of the territory of Bessarabia. Then the north of Bukovina and the south of Bessarabia were incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR, instead Transnistria was annexed to the new Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), which proclaimed its independence in 1990. Although it was not officially recognized by Moscow, Transnistria was also is supported by the Kremlin. A Soviet-era ammunition depot is also located here, guarded by a Russian military contingent, even though Moscow officially committed at the 1999 OSCE summit to withdraw troops and military ammunition by the end of 2001.
Transnistria is considered one of the main elements of blackmail on Chisinau, various Russian officials speaking in favor of or warning against recognizing the independence of the separatist region. After the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Kiev referred several times to the security risk presented by the separatist region, even if its military power is small, and Chisinau reiterated that it opts for the settlement of the conflict only by peaceful means.
OBJECTIVE: To cause animosity between Chisinau and Kiev; to inoculate the idea that the Republic of Moldova is an ally of Ukraine and, respectively, an enemy of Moscow, thus justifying a possible Russian military intervention in this state
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Chisinau opts for the peaceful settlement of the conflict in Transnistria and considers the region part of the Republic of Moldova, as provided for in the Constitution and never, at the official level, was the possibility of an exchange of territories with Ukraine discussed.
The statements of PAS deputy Vasile Soimaru are taken out of context and interpreted. In an interview for jurnal.md in which he spoke about the period of the declaration of independence of the Republic of Moldova in 1992, Soimaru mentions the exchange of territories as a possible scenario in that period - not now. On the contrary, in that interview he claims that now is not the time to take radical decisions.
""If the Union had been proclaimed two or three hours after the declaration of independence, everything would have been much simpler. At that time, we could have solved all the problems, without needing Article 13 of the Constitution and many other messes that we cannot get rid of even now. After all, we could have ceded the Transnistrian region to Ukraine, asking for historical Bessarabia and Bucovina beyond Chernivtsi in return,"" declared Soimaru.
And Ben Hodges' comment seems to have been misinterpreted. Rather, it referred to solving the Transnistrian problem by removing the separatist regime, not by exchanging territories.
With the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the mass media subordinate to the Kremlin, as well as pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau launched several accusations that the Republic of Moldova would violate its neutrality status and support Ukraine, claims that have not been proven and were denied by the Chisinau authorities.
Regarding the recognition of the independence of Transnistria, this can also be seen as an act preceding a possible annexation by Russia, which has already used this strategy in Ukraine. Transnistria was, moreover, targeted by Russia's war plans when it invaded Ukraine, the intention to reach there being expressed by General Rustam Minekaev, deputy commander of Russia's central military district; in addition, images appeared with a map showing the directions of Russia's attack, and one of them was Transnistria.

In reality, Russia violated the UN Declaration of Principles of International Law by invading Ukraine, and the referendums will not be recognized by the international community.
NEWS: ""The People's Republic of Donetsk, the People's Republic of Lugansk, the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions can use the right to self-determination, according to the UN Charter, and Moscow will respect their choice"", declared the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov.
[...] ""We notice the aspiration of the people to be together with Russia, that's why we will respect their choice. These intentions were made public in the last few days by the heads of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, but also by the leaders of Zaporozhye and Kherson. Everyone has the right to self-determination, according to the UN statute,"" said the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
Lavrov recalled that the first state to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics was not Russia, but South Ossetia. ""After Russia came Abkhazia, Syria, North Korea"" [...]
The authorities of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics and the administrations of the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions have decided to organize a series of referendums on joining Russia as subjects of the Federation.
NARRATIVE: Referendums on joining Russia of the territories in the east and south of Ukraine respect the UN Charter
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: According to Sergei Lavrov's argument, the local leaders want the territories of southern and eastern Ukraine to join Russia, and Moscow cannot but support this process, which corresponds to international law. Lavrov is actually trying to manipulate public opinion. The regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia are partially occupied by Russia, and an occupation regime is operating in the territories.
The UN Charter prohibits the invasion of one state by another. In the case of Russia, it is a violation of the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. Russia itself violated the UN Charter, a series of bilateral agreements, memoranda, etc., starting the war in Ukraine. According to the Declaration of the Principles of International Law, cited by Lavrov, every people has the right to self-determination, but without outside support, that is, without actions by third parties to violate territorial inviolability. Russia, however, violated this principle, and the referendums organized by it in Donbass, Kherson and Zaporozhye are non-transparent, do not respect the basic electoral rules and take place under conditions of occupation and war.
More than that, international recognition is also very important. Lavrov declared that the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics was recognized by South Ossetia and Abkhazia - two separatist republics funded by Moscow and not recognized internationally - and by Syria and North Korea, pariah states, subject to international sanctions, with dictatorial regimes brutes who are allied with Russia.
The referendums held by Russia will not be recognized by the international community. Firm signals in this regard have already been given by numerous officials, including the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said that through Russia's actions in Donbass and southern Ukraine, the international order is being destroyed, and the European foreign ministers, who condemned the plans to organize of referendums regarding the annexation of the occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia and stated that they will never recognize their results.
While the international community criticizes Russia for repeatedly violating international law, Sergey Lavrov supports the opposite. According to the UN Declaration, which Lavrov quotes only partially, the member states must refrain from any actions that will determine ""the total or partial dismemberment of the territorial integrity or political unity of the sovereign and independent states, which take into account in the actions their principle of the right to self-determination of peoples"".
Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives in which the subject of international law was used as a justification for the war. In May a.c. the Russian press wrote that the Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for military purposes, the information being confirmed by the UN. In August, Russian propaganda demonstrated that the UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control Ukraine's seaports, after in April Russian television stations reported on the discussion between Vladimir Putin and Antonio Guterres, after which the Kremlin leader convinced the secretary UN General that the Ukrainian Nazis must be tried at the International Criminal Court.

NEWS: ,,Done, the ""Ukrainian Experiment"" is rapidly approaching the end! And, although it is still extremely doubtful that the Putin regime will be able to fulfill the stated objectives of the ""Special Military Operation"", Moscow will still take back an important moral victory. Because the spiral of price increases has finally convinced the European leaders, no matter how globalist they are, that they should not risk and wait for Vladimir Putin to press the ""nuclear button"". Not that of the missiles provided by the Army, of course, but ""only"" that of GAZPROM. The total stoppage of gas supply just at the beginning of winter could radically divert the European movement to support the Ukrainians ""at any cost"" in their own street war waged on the streets of the great capitals of the European Union member states. But since the main European leaders do not want to take on the propaganda shame of ""letting it go"" with the merciless sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation, they will still resort to the much-practiced ""last solution"" to get out of this crisis situation which can dynamite the ""free world"". So that the European and implicitly the Romanian secret services have once again received the thankless mission of ""directing"" large rallies controlled by protest"".
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: For years, Russia has resorted to the so-called energy weapon, trying to exploit the dependence of some European states on its gases in order to achieve its political objectives. In preparation for the war in Ukraine, Moscow sought to influence global gas prices and prevent Europe from replenishing its natural gas reserves precisely so that it would not take measures to support Ukraine. However, the EU adopted several sanctions packages, and many member states also provided Kiev with military equipment, so that Russia began to exert pressure, including by suspending some gas deliveries, for the sanctions to be lifted. Brussels denounced the energy blackmail but refused to give in and change its behavior according to it.
NARRATIVES: 1 The EU will loosen sanctions for fear of the interruption of Russian gas supplies and Moscow's nuclear threats. 2. The EU will abandon Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky. 3. The West will try to justify the abandonment of Ukraine by invoking street protests that will be orchestrated by the secret services of the member states.
OBJECTIVE: To mislead Romanian citizens about the EU's intentions regarding the war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: First of all, the EU reduced gas consumption from the Russian Federation from 45% in 2021 to around 10% today. Also, gas storages in most EU countries are filled to the extent of 80-90% in anticipation of the cold season. Currently, the EU imports a significant amount of gas, either through pipelines or brought on ships as LNG from Norway, Algeria, Azerbaijan, the USA and Qatar.
Thus, Russia's ""energy weapon"" is no longer as effective as it was before the invasion of Ukraine. If the energy companies will sell energy at high prices, they will be over-taxed, which will reduce their appetite for the artificial maintenance of high gas prices.
Russia can no longer issue claims as in the past regarding blackmailing the EU through gas, so the EU has prepared in advance a series of measures for the cold season based on the scenario of Moscow's well-known gas blackmail. In addition, Russia needs the money it receives from hydrocarbon exports and does not have available markets to export the gas it would no longer deliver to Europe, which would mean either burning them or closing the wells , both variants causing him significant losses.
As far as nuclear threats are concerned, Moscow constantly makes such statements as a deterrent to the West, which in turn is armed with such weapons. A nuclear war is unlikely, however, as it would guarantee mutual destruction. Moscow threatened again, through President Vladimir Putin (indirectly) and former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, that it could resort to nuclear weapons after the partial mobilization was announced in the context of the defeats suffered in Ukraine. However, Western leaders were not impressed or discouraged by Moscow's rhetoric and promised to continue supporting Ukraine, including through arms deliveries. Moreover, Brussels wants to adopt new sanctions against the Russian Federation and the only country that has so far expressed its opposition to them was Hungary, given that the Orban regime has a privileged relationship with Moscow and a tense one with its European partners the cause of undermining the rule of law.
Moreover, the invitation for the first time to the meeting of heads of state and government from the EU, in Prague, on October 6-7, of the leaders of the candidate states for EU accession and those about to receive this status - Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the countries of the Western Balkans - it is a signal as strong as possible that the EU is with these countries more than ever.
In no case are the EU states showing signs that they will abandon Ukraine or the leader from Kiev, Volodymyr Zelensky, in the face of Russian aggression.
""I want to say the following words to the citizens of the Western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia: you are part of our family, your future is in our Union, and our Union is not complete without you!"" declared the head of the EC, Ursula von der Leyen on September 14 in the EP plenary, the first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, was also present at the event.
Regarding the protests invoked by the author of the article in National, in several European countries there have been more or less extensive demonstrations, generally initiated by far-right political formations of the type cultivated by Russia in recent years, and at which people worried about the economic effects of the war in Ukraine (increase in energy prices, inflation) also participated. See, for example, the case of the Czech Republic, recently analyzed by Veridica.
Moreover, the author does not provide any proof in support of his statements, but only makes some statements in a style that, on the one hand, reminds of standard fake-news, by taking over some narratives circulated by Russian and pro-Russian propaganda, on the other hand it has similarities with a category of fake news that appeared in the Romanian press especially in the 90s and 2000s and were called, among journalists, ""fonfleuri"".

The partial mobilization is presented as a step towards de-escalation, a necessary measure for diplomatic dialogue and the prevention of a nuclear disaster or a war on Russian territory.
NEWS: ""The President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, is trying to prevent a nuclear disaster. His speech from September 21 is seen by specialists not only as a patriotic message addressed to the Russians, but also as a challenge to the West collectively and personally to President Joe Biden. According to political scientists, Putin spoke openly about a great danger, but he did so in order to find a way to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine.
[...]
The international situation in the war zone forced Putin to resort to partial mobilization, political scientist Boris Mejuev told URA.RU. ""In this situation, de-escalation will occur through escalation. The problem needs to be solved once and for all. The solution will be found through a new strong strike [...] Kiev depends on the US, which can force Ukraine to sit down at the negotiating table. Either Washington will understand this message and return to the diplomatic process or events will take an unpredictable turn"".
NARRATIVE: The partial mobilization ordered by Putin will prevent a nuclear disaster, will lead to a de-escalation of the conflict and a diplomatic dialogue.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: On September 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization of Russians who can fight. Putin also suggested that Russia could use its nuclear arsenal.
The mobilization concerns, first of all, the reservists. 300 thousand people would initially be called up under arms, according to the Russian Minister of Defense, Sergei Soigu, but they represent only a fraction of the total number of people who can be called up.
The Russian government press presented this decision as a pacifist step by Putin, who dreams, apparently, of peace, but is not supported by the West.
According to the false narratives of the Russian government media, specialists praise Putin for having managed to find a method of imposing peace on the territory of Ukraine - partial mobilization. In fact, political scientists from Moscow, close to or financed by the Kremlin regime, are cited, not specialists from other countries.
While US President Joe Biden accused Russia of violating the basic principles of membership of the United Nations by invading Ukraine and said that Moscow is making ""irresponsible"" threats with the use of nuclear weapons, the Russian press writes that Vladimir Putin is trying to prevent a nuclear disaster and to force the Ukrainians to sit down at the negotiating table.
In reality, partial or general mobilization cannot determine a de-escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. On the contrary, by sending new forces to the invaded territory, Russia practically escalates the conflict, and by threatening to use its nuclear arsenal, it also raises the stakes. It seems at least illogical the thesis launched in the Russian public space by a pro-Kremlin political scientist about ""de-escalation that will occur through escalation"". That is, in order to achieve peace, he will organize a big war. It is a logic that reminds, rather, from the one in the novel ""1984"", where the ministry in charge of war had been renamed the ""Ministry of Peace"".
It should be noted that the peace in Ukraine does not depend on the USA, but primarily on Russia, which invaded the neighboring state, destroyed localities, civilian targets, killed children, women and the elderly. The peace negotiations, analyzed in the Russian press, are actually discussions about possible territorial cessions or the capitulation of Ukraine. Ukraine has never issued territorial claims on Russia and neither has any NATO state, so all that Moscow should do, if it wants peace, would be to withdraw its forces from the invaded territories.
It is not clear how a nuclear disaster can be prevented with the help of a speech that includes direct threats. Putin clearly said in his speech that whoever threatens Russia with nuclear weapons will be attacked first. These discussions do not at all resemble elements of de-escalation, pacification and diplomatic process narratives, a fact also noticed by the international community.
According to British Foreign Minister Gillian Keegan, Vladimir Putin's speech indicates a worrying escalation. ""It's obviously an escalation,"" the British official said. And the EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy Josep Borrell said that Russia is again choosing the path of war.
In fact, the Russian press tries through these false narratives to justify the decision to order the partial mobilization in front of the public opinion.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives that justified, starting on February 24, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. In March, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine wants to prolong the war and uses its citizens as human shields, while Russia protects Ukrainian civilians. In April, according to Russian government media, southern Ukraine was liberated by nationalists and wants to be annexed to Russia. To exonerate Russia in this war, Russian propaganda shows that the West is investigating the atrocities committed by Ukrainian nationalists while Putin is looking for solutions for peace in Ukraine.

The narrative was launched in the context in which the Ukrainian army found in the Izium area mass graves with the remains of hundreds of people, some with signs of summary executions, and chambers where civilians were tortured.
NEWS: ""Moscow is once again accused by the authorities in Kiev, who claim that the Russian military, the Russians, organized massacres and tortured the population in the Kharkiv region. It seems that in the territories that were controlled by Russia, Ukraine is preparing a new challenge similar to the one in Bucea - the presentation of the corpses of the victims of the occupation.
[...]
The head of the Kharkiv Regional Administration in the liberated territories, Vitali Gancev, informed that in the cities of Kupiansk and Veliki Burlik, occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, ""mercenaries walk around the towns and shoot people, everything is filmed"".,,I think they need to be cleaned these cities, then it will be shown to public opinion that the Russian military did this and that all the corpses were found on the streets"", informs RIA Novosti, quoting Vitali Gancev.
[...]
""If Kiev chooses to repeat the provocation from Bucea, regardless of whether it will be organized professionally or not, the West will reject all the evidence and arguments of Moscow"", Larisa Sesler, head of the Union of Political Emigrants and Political Detainees from Ukraine, told Vzglead [...] Therefore, the West wants to present more evidence in the places where the atrocities of the Russian army were staged"".
NARRATIVE: The Izium massacre is a staging designed to discredit Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: On September 12, two days after the liberation of the city of Izium, a local Ukrainian councilor stated that the Russian army would have killed over a thousand people in this town, and on September 15, Ukraine announced that it had discovered pits communes in the Kharkiv region; a day later, President Volodymyr Zelenski published images of the mass grave, writing that the people there are victims of the Russian occupation, including people with torture marks, bombing victims, children and soldiers. At the same time, representatives of the National Police of Ukraine said that at least 10 rooms were found in the liberated districts, in which civilians were tortured. There are dozens of witnesses to these atrocities.
The Russian press wrote, also on September 12, that a new staging of a massacre was being prepared, following the Bucea model. So, a few days before the official declarations of the representatives of Ukraine and the visit of the president of Ukraine to Izium, the Russian press was preparing the public opinion for an avalanche of accusations from Kiev and the states of the West.
A separatist leader from the Kharkiv region, self-proclaimed head of the Regional Administration, is quoted as saying that the Ukrainian military is shooting at civilians, therefore ""committing a massacre"", but the blame will be placed on Moscow. In other words, Russian propaganda has admitted with a few days before Kiev's announcement that a massacre had been committed, but attributed it to the Ukrainian military.
Also mentioned is Larisa Sesler, who represents the Union of Political Emigrants and Political Detainees from Ukraine - an organization founded on Russian territory by pro-Russian politicians who fled to Moscow. Sesler participates in anti-European and pro-Kremlin rallies on the territory of Ukraine, collaborating with the Kremlin.
The way the mass graves look and the condition of the bodies suggest that between the moment of burial and the moment when the Ukrainians announced the discovery of the mass graves, much more time passed than the maximum five days that had passed since the Russians had withdrawn from the region, which they had controlled for months.
Officials of the western states declared themselves shocked by the situation in Izium. The EU and the US have announced that they will support all Ukraine's efforts to punish those guilty of the atrocities in the Kharkiv region. The UN experts declared that they will visit the city of Izium, at the invitation of the Ukrainian side, to document the war crimes and verify the information about the torture of civilians. In the Kharkiv region, there are many journalists from abroad who reported from the spot about the mass graves and torture chambers during the occupation. In addition, Ukraine has opened an official investigation.
Finally, another argument against Russia is the fact that its soldiers committed numerous war crimes, documented including by international organizations, and the pro-Kremlin press tried to attribute them to the Ukrainians.
Veridica also dismantled a series of propaganda articles in this regard. In June, the pro-Kremlin press wrote that the Ukrainian army is massacring Russian speakers during the withdrawal from Donbass, and in July - that Volodymyr Zelenski will be tried for war crimes in Ukraine. When the international community was shocked by the atrocities of the Russian military in the Kiev region, the Russian media misinformed the readers/viewers, reporting on a group of American experts who demonstrated that the murders in Bucea were an invention of ""Ukrainian propaganda"". Then, the Russian press distributed another false narrative, writing that Ukraine invited experts from France who work to hide the evidence of war crimes committed by the Ukrainian army in Bucea.

In reality, the West is the biggest financial supporter of the Republic of Moldova, which is affected by the crisis just like the rest of the countries in the region.
NEWS: ""The united European Union began to fall apart with the arrival of the cold weather: the economic giants that until recently called the Republic of Moldova in their special, sincere and open family, have now forgotten about one of the poorest countries in Europe.
Neighboring Romania closed its eyes to all principles and announced that from today onwards it will deliver electricity to Moldova at a double rate of 1.428 euros for one MW/h.
The anti-Russian policy of the ruling party in Chisinau led to economic and social crises. As is known, the current government has turned its gaze to the West""
NARRATIVES: 1. The European Union (the West) abandoned the Republic of Moldova. 2. Romania doubled the tariffs for the energy it gives to the Republic of Moldova. 3. The crises facing the Republic of Moldova are caused by the incorrect decision to choose the pro-European vector. 4. The government in Chisinau is Russophobic.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is the country in the region most affected by the economic crisis and the consequences of the Russian military invasion in Ukraine. Annual inflation has exceeded 34%, and besides the fact that energy resources have become enormously expensive, the uncertainty of gas insurance persists in the cold season, given that the authorities in Chisinau have not yet reached a common denominator with Gazprom regarding a claimed debts of over 700 million dollars.
Meanwhile, in Chisinau, the opposition organizes protest actions more and more frequently, the old topics related to the foreign policy vector - towards the EU, or towards the East - being resumed.
OBJECTIVE: To present the West as a disloyal partner and to reduce citizens' trust in the EU and Western institutions. To present the Chisinau government as Russophobic and guilty of the crises the country is facing.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: EU member states and international organizations intensified their efforts to support Moldova shortly after the launch of the Russian invasion against Ukraine. Romania, Germany and France launched the so-called Support Platform for Moldova, gathered for the first time in Berlin, on April 5, at which assistance for the Republic of Moldova in the amount of 660 million euros was announced.
At the beginning of August, the European Commission, on behalf of the European Union, released the first tranche of 50 million euros from the macro-financial assistance package (MFA) for the Republic of Moldova. Thus, the European Union offers 35 million euros in long-term loans under preferential conditions and 15 million euros in the form of grants. This is the first tranche of the macro-financial assistance for the Republic of Moldova, which entered into force on July 18, 2022 and which will be offered in three tranches in the next two and a half years. The macro-financial assistance is part of a larger support from the EU and international donors, offered within the Interministerial Support Platform, initiated in Berlin on April 5, 2022, to help the Republic of Moldova overcome multiple crises.
Romania did not double the tariff for the energy supplied to the Republic of Moldova, as baltnews writes, because it does not even deliver electricity to the Republic of Moldova. Romania has doubled the energy transit tariff, in accordance with EU rules, applicable to non-EU member states, in this case it is the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine that have joined the ENTSO-E system.
However, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine are discussing with the European authorities their integration into the EU mechanism for compensating the costs related to the hosting of cross-border electricity flows, so that the user fee currently applied to them is eliminated.
Inflation began to rise worldwide starting with the second half of 2021 as a result of the economic recovery after the pandemic crisis of the previous year and the increase in demand for raw materials and services.
In the Republic of Moldova, the highest increase in prices in the region is recorded due to the excessive dependence on Russian gas and energy products in general (the Republic of Moldova imports all the necessary fuel and gas and produces a small share of green energy, and the rest of the necessary electricity imports it or produces it all from imported resources).
Another factor that led to the excessive increase in prices is the high dependence on transport routes from Ukraine, especially the port of Odessa, blocked due to Russian military intervention.
Also, this year's drought, together with the increase in fuel prices, also caused an increase in the prices of food products, especially vegetables.
It is true that the Republic of Moldova also faces its own internal dysfunctions such as monopolies, a large number of intermediaries, expensive loans, problems that have accumulated over the years, etc., which also influence the increase in prices.

The false narrative is part of the anti-NATO and anti-Western rhetoric, which intensified with the Russian aggression in Ukraine.
NEWS: ""We must do everything to keep the peace, and for this we must respect the agreements we have"". This is the opinion of the ex-president of the country Igor Dodon. In an interview for the TASS agency, he pleaded for the preservation of neutrality R Moldova, mentioning ""this is our geopolitical advantage in the face of military risks"".
""I'm sorry that, by closing universities and schools for economic reasons, our authorities are loosening cooperation with NATO, preparing to procure Western weapons. Military aid from the Alliance may prove a disservice, which will bring trouble to our country and turn our people into cannon fodder, in the cynical games of the great world actors. We don't need this!"", emphasized the politician. [...] NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European government in Chisinau closes universities and schools in order to procure Western NATO weapons. 2. NATO military aid will cause problems for the Republic of Moldova and will turn the people into cannon fodder. 3. Neutrality is the only way to ensure the security of the Republic of Moldova.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to discredit the pro-Western orientation and disrupt the European path of the Republic of Moldova. They are also trying to inoculate the idea that a possible renunciation of neutrality and joining NATO would be catastrophic for the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT: The danger of the Russian war in Ukraine has brought to the fore the issue of national security, the Republic of Moldova having on its territory a secessionist region supported militarily by the Russian Federation, since 1992, when there was a war on the Dniester. In this context, the issue of equipping and modernizing the National Army was raised. The Republic of Moldova has one of the smallest defense budgets in the region, which has never exceeded the level of 0.4% of GDP. This summer, the Council of the European Union approved an assistance measure under the European Instrument for Peace in the amount of 40 million euros for the benefit of the Army of the Republic of Moldova. Also, in the context of the Russian war in Ukraine, experts from Chisinau warn that the neutrality of the Republic of Moldova is not enough to ensure its security.
Former president Igor Dodon, who is under house arrest, being investigated on five charges, including treason, illegal funding of the party, corruption and illicit enrichment, gave several interviews to the Russian press, in which he brought accuses the pro-European governments in Chisinau.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In the Republic of Moldova, a reform of the university system is taking place, some higher education institutions being merged with others. This reform is primarily dictated by the small number of students, also caused by the major demographic problem of the Republic of Moldova. However, the reduction in the number of universities has nothing to do with cooperation with NATO, the defense budget or other collaborations in the military field, as Igor Dodon insinuates.
The cooperation of the Republic of Moldova with NATO takes place within the framework of the Partnership for Peace (PfP). Participating in it offers the Republic of Moldova a real possibility to strengthen its national security and defense capabilities, to benefit from the expertise and experience of NATO member and partner countries in the field of security and defense, assistance in the training of personnel, language training of National Army officers, etc. . Also, PfP ensures access to information, statistics, sources of political, technical and financial aid. A special aspect is the familiarization of the military with the manner of conducting peacekeeping operations.
Also, the Republic of Moldova cooperates with NATO in the scientific and environmental protection fields. Through the NATO Special Affection Fund, within the project on the destruction of pesticides and dangerous chemical products, thousands of tons of dangerous pesticide waste were neutralized, for the benefit of the health of the population of the Republic of Moldova. Within the NATO Science for Peace and Security Program, the Republic of Moldova has projects with NATO regarding the creation of the training center in the field of cyber security, the chemical laboratory for the analysis of pesticides in the Republic of Moldova, the regional project regarding the harmonization of the geography of earthquake risks in Bulgaria, Romania and the Republic of Moldova , assessing the risks of landslides in the central part of the Republic of Moldova, developing a multinational telemedicine system for emergency situations.
All these cooperations are for the benefit of the security and well-being of the population, not to the detriment of the Republic of Moldova, as Igor Dodon declares. In fact, the narratives that the former pro-Russian president repeats are part of the anti-NATO and anti-Western rhetoric that Russia supports, including in the former Soviet republics, in order to keep them in its sphere of influence. They intensified with the Russian aggression in Ukraine.
The money promised through the European Instrument for Peace is intended for strengthening the capacities of the logistics, mobility, command and control, cyber security, etc. units for the Military Medical Service and the Engineering Battalion, which do not directly target the military capacity of the army.
However, the principle of neutrality does not prohibit the development and equipping of the National Army or of international cooperation or missions. The best-known neutral state in the world, Switzerland, has a well-equipped and trained army; moreover, the Swiss legislature recently approved the purchase of 36 last-generation F-35 fighter jets, produced in the United States.
At the same time, the neutrality of the Republic of Moldova is violated by the Russian Federation, which illegally maintains its troops on its territory.
The government from Chisinau did not announce that it is renouncing the status of neutrality. On the contrary, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the authorities have emphasized several times the fact that the Republic of Moldova respects the principle of neutrality. Publication / Media:

Oleksii Reznikov's words were taken out of context. He spoke about a future multilateral peace agreement after the capitulation of Russia and a constructive dialogue with the West.
NEWS: The Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Oleksii Reznikov, said that the authorities in Kiev recently understood that they no longer have to trust the informal promises made by the Western partners. That is why, in order to reach peace in Ukraine, the authorities are ready to sign a multilateral document, which will contain certain security guarantees.
""I learned a lot, including learning not to trust various attempts to help us achieve peace in Ukraine. Unfortunately, in 2014 there were such attempts from our partners, but those instruments and those agreements that were proposed did not work"", said Reznikov.
[...] an example is the Budapest Memorandum, which deprived Ukraine of the status of third country in the world in terms of nuclear potential and did not offer the country the desired security.
 [...]
The press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Peskov, recently declared that Russia is ready and wants to resolve the situation in Ukraine diplomatically on the basis of its own conditions. Moscow and Kiev must discuss precisely the fulfillment of these conditions. At the same time, Peskov noted that Moscow's conditions remain the same. The final goal of the special operation, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is ""the liberation of Donbass and the creation of conditions that guarantee Russia's security"".
NARRATIVE: The government in Kiev expressed its lack of confidence in its partners from the West.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, during the interview given to the Ukrainian television station ICTV, the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Oleksii Reznikov, stated that he no longer trusts formal armistices or other agreements that do not provide real security guarantees. He said that ""the future act of Russia's capitulation must be a multilateral agreement that contains security guarantees from partners that Ukraine trusts."" The Russian media did not mention anything about Moscow's capitulation and took Reznikov's statement out of context. with the aim of manipulating public opinion.
Moreover, the Minister of Defense from Kiev declared on ICTV: ""We do not trust those who stood in front of us at the negotiations. Then I thought we could negotiate something with them"". The Minister of Defense was referring to the representatives of Russia, who participated in the peace negotiations regarding the situation in Donbass in the period 2014-2022. In Reznikov's statement, we do not find theses about mistrust in the West, but we do find about ""the instruments or agreements that no longer work"".
Therefore, the news published by RIA Novosti and picked up by other government press agencies in Russia radically misrepresents the statements of the Ukrainian minister. As an amplification element, the argument about the Budapest Memorandum is used, which refers to the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine and provides security guarantees of its independence. Through this treaty, Ukraine gave up the Soviet nuclear weapons on its territory, which were transferred to the Russian Federation.
According to Russian propaganda, the Budapest Memorandum was proposed to Ukraine only by the West, which tricked Kiev. Nothing is said about the violation of this document by Russia in 2014.
It is worth mentioning that in August the MFA in Moscow mentioned that Russia did not violate the provisions of the Budapest Memorandum because the West bombed the former Yugoslavia, created the state of Kosovo, got involved in the political life of Ukraine in 2004, which means destroying the legal foundations of the agreement"". After the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, declared that the memorandum does not provide for any obligation of Russia to collaborate with an illegitimate regime in Kiev.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the West's destructive role in the war in Ukraine. The Russian government media wrote that terrorists are being trained on EU territory who will act against civilians in Donbass, the West is asking Kiev to surrender to Moscow, while Ukrainian refugees are housed in former Nazi concentration camps.

In reality, the Government of Poland adopted a program of arming and increasing the number of soldiers in the context of the risk of the war in Ukraine extending over its territory.
NEWS: ""The representative of the Ministry of Defense of Poland told journalists that Warsaw plans to start a war against Russia in the next 10 years.
In a maximum of 10 years, Poland could start a war against Russia. This forecast was made by Poland's Deputy Minister of Defense Marcin Ocepa.
According to him, Warsaw must use the available time as efficiently as possible for the rearmament and modernization of the army.
[...]
In particular, the most ""ambitious"" armament program in the history of the country was adopted. The number of soldiers in the Polish army will reach 300 thousand for 10 years. It is also planned to purchase tanks, artillery, drones and so on far away.""
NARRATIVE: Poland will start a war against Russia in the next 10 years.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there is no statement from Poland's Deputy Defense Minister or any other Warsaw politician about planning a war against Russia. On the contrary, the government of Poland adopted a program of arming and increasing the number of soldiers in the context of the risk of the war in Ukraine expanding on its territory. In other words, Poland is preparing for a possible Russian aggression against it.
The Russian press took the statements of Poland's Deputy Minister of Defense out of context and intentionally presented them incorrectly in order to sow panic in Russian society and maintain a high level of support for the war in Ukraine, called by Russian propaganda a ""special military operation"".
The Deputy Minister of Defense of the Republic of Poland declared for ""Dziennik Gazeta Prawna"" that there is a serious risk of war with Russia in the next 3-10 years. He mentioned that war is much more expensive than investments in defense, this truth being demonstrated by the case of Ukraine. ""Our goal is to scare the enemy and show that it is not worth attacking Poland"", said Marcin Ocepa.
Therefore, the Polish official referred to a defense strategy, and not an offensive one, as the Russian press wrote. Marcin Ocepa declared that Russia could attack Poland even after the end of the war in Ukraine, after it reorganizes. ""We must use this time to arm the Polish army,"" said Ocepa.
After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Poland helped both Ukraine and the Ukrainian refugees on its territory. Right from the first days of the war, the leadership of Poland declared that Russia must be stopped now, because, otherwise, the war could expand. In September, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki declared that the EU must prepare for a possible extension of the war, because Moscow is dominated by the idea of ​​occupying other states. Therefore, the statements of the officials from the Ministry of Defense are in accordance with the defensive vision of the Polish leadership.
Veridica has already written about a series of false narratives regarding Poland, according to which President Duda admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories, and that Kiev would have allowed 10 thousand soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country. In July, the Russian press wrote that Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to seize a part of Ukraine. Publication / Media:

This false narrative, promoted in an online publication from Romania, repeats Russian propaganda theses and ignores Moscow's actions that have led to the current situation.
NEWS: ""It's happening on the Holland-Norway axis. And by no means the fault of the Russian Federation, which continues to be falsely accused of blackmail in the field of gas and oil. Reality hits us in the face. Currently, only 9% of the total gas used in Europe comes from the Russian Federation. In record time, Norway became the main EU supplier. But how does the energy bubble explode? The price of energy went up in a way completely and completely uncontrolled by the European Commission. More on the saddle, through a completely and completely artificial mechanism. It is called TTF - Title Transfer Facility, a virtual institution based in Amsterdam, owned and manipulated by a few tricksters. This institution and the game it has played so far, extremely dangerous for all EU member states, should have been controlled, but they were not, by ESMA. ESMA is the authority that was created to control the financial markets. The leaders of the European Union literally made a laughing stock. The joke culminated on September 9, when an extraordinary Council was convened, attended by the Ministers of Energy and where important decisions were to be made, aimed at keeping the price of gas under control in the future. This extraordinary Council was falsely put under the sign of the war in Ukraine and the energy blackmail that the Russian Federation would exercise. And the solution that was targeted, the solution of solutions, would have been the mandatory capping of the price of all gases. A decision that apparently put the revenues of the Russian Federation on the ground. But in reality, as we stated above, only 9% of the gases burned in Europe come from the Russian Federation at the moment"". NARRATIVES: 1. Russia is not to blame for the price increase in the energy sector 2. The EU and the US are greedy and have created an artificial tool for calculating gas prices 3. Russia respects long-term contracts, and price caps violate these contracts.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: The European Commission has proposed capping the price of natural gas coming from Russia.
The French Minister of Finance, Bruno Le Maire, and the German Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, called for solidarity in the entire EU bloc in search of solutions to help households and businesses in the EU.
""We want to avoid higher revenues for Russia and we want to maintain the level of prices for our economies and a favorable means is limiting the price of oil. It is more effective when several member states of the European Union support this idea,"" said Lindner.
The idea is not approved by Norway, a country outside the EU bloc, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, decided to partially abandon the idea and instead ask for overtaxing energy companies, according to an official document cited by The Guardian.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing the false idea among the public opinion in Romania that it is not Russia that is manipulating the energy market.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In recent years, Russia has frequently used the energy weapon to influence political decisions in the European states where it supplies natural gas. Gazprom has always functioned as the ""armed arm"" of the Kremlin's policies to dictate political courses. The higher the percentage of delivered gas, the more leverage Russia had on the respective countries.
European legislators have repeatedly accused Russia of manipulating energy exports to increase the prices of raw materials and sow uncertainty in the entire EU bloc. Moscow denied the use of energy as a weapon, but this was an integral part of the campaign to prepare for war, Moscow seeking, on the one hand, to ensure that Europeans did not stockpile for the winter and, on the other hand, that prices natural gas will go up.
The invasion from Ukraine changed the state of things even more, so prices increased even more. The movement was carefully coordinated by Moscow, which earned even more money from the sale of hydrocarbons.
Only in the first six months of the war, Russia earned no less than 158 billion euros, while it spent about 100 billion dollars on the war in Ukraine. The EU imported 54% of these hydrocarbons, worth approximately 85 billion euros. Fossil fuel exports have contributed an estimated €43 billion to Russia's federal budget since the start of the invasion, helping to finance war crimes in Ukraine, according to a recent study.
In six months, the EU managed to reduce dependence on Russian gas from 40% to 9% as a policy of economic asphyxiation of the Russian war machine unleashed against Ukraine.
As a result of Germany's favorable position for capping gas prices, last week Gazprom decided to indefinitely stop the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, which connects Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea.
The Kremlin has since said that the resumption of gas supplies to Europe is completely dependent on the EU lifting economic sanctions against Moscow. This clearly shows that Russia conditions the contracts in force on political decisions and not, as the author of the article claims, that Russia respects the contracts it has with European countries.
The closest example is the Republic of Moldova itself, which even at this time does not know whether Gazprom will supply it with gas and in what volumes for the month of October, although it has a clear contract from October 29-30, 2021 for five years with a certain volume of gas and a precise price schedule.
""I think that taking into account the fact that we have a 5-year contract, 6 months do not make a difference. From the discussions with Miller, I did not understand if they will disconnect the Republic of Moldova from gas or if they will continue deliveries after October 1"", said the Minister of Infrastructure and Regional Development of the Republic of Moldova, Andrei Spinu, during a televised show on the public television channel from Chisinau on September 9.

This is accompanied by theses specific to Russian propaganda regarding the Republic of Moldova - the West's control over the country, the ""danger"" of the union with Romania and the ""false"" fight against corruption.
NEWS: ""Against the background of the ""special operation"" in Ukraine, Washington and Brussels are pushing the once friendly republics of the former USSR not only to distance themselves from Moscow, which they have already done, but also to get rid of the internal opposition that is being expressed for the cancellation of sanctions and the dialogue with Moscow. Little Moldova is not an exception and risks being caught between two fires in the midst of an economic crisis, caused by high gas prices in Europe. President Maia Sandu obediently fulfills the recommendations from the White House, putting pressure on opposition, and the fight against corruption serves as a pretext.
[...]
Now they have also reached the national autonomies.
[...]
In 1994, Gagauzia was ready to join Russia in order not to become a hostage to the course of reunification with Romania, but gave up this intention in exchange for the status of autonomy. Today, the Gagauzians oppose the pro-Western course promoted by Maia Sandu. They do not want to repeat the experience of being part of Romania.
[...]
President Maia Sandu, it seems, arrived in Gagauzia only to emphasize the harsh course of the ""pro-European identity"" authorities and to silence those who oppose or those who are undecided. The fact that Gagauzia has the constitutional right to its own opinion , is simply ignored. And now Chisinau threatens to take away the autonomy status of the Gagauz people.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The authorities in Chisinau are being manipulated by the West. 2. The fight against corruption is, in fact, a pretext for eliminating the (pro-Russian) opposition. 3. Chisinau intends to deprive Gagauzia of its autonomy status.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: One of the main theses of the Kremlin's propaganda and the pro-Russian media in the Republic of Moldova, after the victories of Maia Sandu and her party in the 2020 presidential and 2021 parliamentary elections, is that the pro-European government in Chisinau is controlled by the west. The messages intensified after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, against the backdrop of the economic crisis and rising inflation, which hit the Republic of Moldova hard, but also in the context of the opening of files on illegal financing of the main left-wing parties, protest actions against the government began in the Republic of Moldova. These also intensified in the Gagauzia autonomy in the south of the country, where separatist messages also sounded. President Maia Sandu visited the region at the beginning of September, where she had a meeting with the deputies from the pro-Russian region, who reproached her, among other things, for not personally discussing with Moscow to obtain a lower price to gas.
OBJECTIVE: To induce the idea that the Republic of Moldova is led by a Russophobic regime, thus justifying the pressures or even a possible military intervention by Russia. To encourage the Russian-speaking national minorities, especially in Gagauzia.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Chisinau authorities condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but did not officially join the sanctions imposed by the West. Prices, especially those of energy resources, have increased internationally, one of the main causes being Russia's war in Ukraine. The Republic of Moldova is more vulnerable to external economic shocks, having a small, open economy and being practically totally dependent on imported energy resources.
The Gagauz region, where the majority of the population is Russian-speaking and Russophile, in the south of the Republic of Moldova obtained the status of autonomy in 1994, and no one from the country's leadership made any statement about the possibility/necessity of withdrawing this status. Just as it is not discussed at the official level, neither in Chisinau nor in Bucharest, about the possibility of uniting the Republic of Moldova with Romania.
A large part of the files opened lately in the name of some opposition politicians refer to actions committed in previous years, some of them were opened previously, but the investigations dragged on. In particular, representatives of the Sor Party, led by the fugitive politician Ilan Sor, convicted by the first court in the large-scale bank fraud case of 2014, and former president Igor Dodon are targeted. He appears in several cases of corruption, illegal financing of the party, treason.
And the statement that ""Gagauzia has the constitutional right to its own opinion"" is a lie. The Constitution of the Republic of Moldova does not contain such provisions. It is true, however, that a special law on the status of autonomy provides that ""in the event of a change in the status of the Republic of Moldova as an independent state, The people of Gagauzia have the right to external self-determination"".
In fact, it is not the first time that the corruption files are tried to be presented as the fight of the pro-European government against political opponents. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVE: The inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region are waiting for the liberation of the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odessa from the Ukrainian Nazis.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Vladimir Rogov, mentioned by the Russian press as a member of the Zaporozhye Region Administration Council - only partially controlled by the Russian military - is a representative of the Russian bodies in the occupied area of ​​the region. Rogov fled to Russia in 2014, after speaking out against Euromaidan, supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass, and in 2022 he was appointed Moscow's representative in the Zaporizhia region.
In July, the EU adopted sanctions against Vladimir Rogov for supporting or carrying out ""actions that undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, the stability or security of Ukraine"".
The Russian press, especially RIA Novosti and government television stations, often ask Rogov for interviews, most of which are also published on his Telegram channel. In these interviews, Rogor speaks on behalf of all the inhabitants of the Zaporizhia region, including those in the territories controlled by Kiev. Rogov popularizes Russian propaganda narratives, saying that the Ukrainian Nazis are oppressing the cities of Odessa, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, and the residents are just waiting to be liberated by Russia. Moreover, the Russian press adds, without any evidence, that ""the regions have declared that they want to be joined to Russia"", preparing public opinion for the eventual holding of some ""referendums"" on joining.
In reality, the inhabitants of the regions listed by RIA Novosti oppose a strong resistance to Russian aggression. Since the beginning of the war, unarmed people stopped Russian tanks, went out to protests, shattering the Kremlin's illusions about pro-Russian attitudes in Donbass. According to a survey carried out in August last year, 81% of Ukrainians declared that the Russians are the enemies of Ukrainians. Over 90% of respondents were hostile to Russia.
In protest against Moscow's aggression, many Ukrainians in the east of the country have given up speaking Russian, switching to Ukrainian, according to a survey published in August.
The ""liberation"" requested by Rogov is, in fact, a claim of the territories of a sovereign state by the neighboring state through destruction, bombings and the killing of civilians. The narratives about ""liberation"" and ""annexation"" are increasingly distributed by the Russian media starting with July 20, when the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, declared that Moscow is expanding its ""special operation"" in Ukraine to the southern regions.
The data on the ground and the situation on the front show that the residents of the regions in the south-east of Ukraine do not expect any liberation from Russia, but a withdrawal of the occupation troops from their territory.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Veridica has debunked a series of false narratives regarding the situation in the Zaporozhye region. In April, the Russian press wrote that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporizhia are requesting to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. In May, Vladimir Rogov, quoted by Russian government press agencies, said that Ukraine is preparing to cede the city of Zaporozhye, and in June the Russian press wrote that volunteers from Zaporozhye are joining a battalion that will defend the region from the aggression of the Ukrainian army . In August, Rogov boasted that Zaporozhye had established contacts with at least 15 states, including EU members. Publication / Media:

The false narrative ignores the fact that Russia needs the money of the Europeans, and the latter have taken measures to avoid a major energy crisis.
NEWS: ""The European Commission is preparing for a new assault in the fight with energy prices. This is like a tacit recognition of restrictive policies and Ceausescu-like ""reduce consumption"" messages that have failed. In the middle of the fight with climate neutrality, the officials from Brussels forgot that we have to go through a winter, which can be our new Stalingrad or Gazingrad. At the beginning of the summer, more precisely on July 26, 2022, EU energy ministers reached a political agreement regarding a 15% reduction in natural gas demand for this winter. Said and not done [...] The price increase on the energy exchanges started last year, around this time. Let's not forget that the first ceiling in Romania was made in December 2021, when the war in Crimea had not yet started. Today, the melodic line of flabby propaganda is set to ""Putin is to blame."" A return to the winters of early feudalism is being prepared [...] Petrisor Peiu, the beloved financial analyst, proves that the sanctions have strengthened the ruble by 25% and that Moscow's state budget has accumulated an additional 160 billion dollars, by increasing prices to oil and gas. The risks of protests in the countries of the civilized world increased by 50%, between the second and third quarter, says the latest report of Verisk, quoted by Reuters [...] The index of social disturbances increased, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, according to the report published on Friday. Romania is not among the first hundred countries with a high risk of protests. One more argument for my opinion, formulated in the years of Tefelism, fierce as a foot-beater on the asphalt, that the new Securitate took the young people to the streets [...] At the end of the week, the officials from Brussels meet again to take the in Ploiesti. A maximum price for gas and electricity would be discussed. Only that would contravene the free market. Gazprom has already announced that it does not accept the formula. Putin is preparing Gazingrad for us (term launched yesterday on the Gold FM show) and we are rubbing our fists in the great global warming. From the cretinism of European leaders, we are plunging into black feudalism. Energy prices are rising because the market has gone crazy. Politicians no longer control anything. The big investors are also rubbing their hands, but with joy. NARRATIVES: 1. Europe has big problems due to the fact that it imposed sanctions on Russia and now it will freeze in winter 2. Putin is not to blame for the war in Ukraine 3. Romania will be hit by a major energy crisis, which will lead to revolt the population.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: With the approach of the cold season, Russia is forcing the hand of the West to reduce the sanctions it imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine. They had a strong impact on the Russian economy. Russia's central bank now estimates that the $1.8 trillion economy will contract by 4%-6% in 2022, less than the 8%-10% contraction it forecast in April. Russia has been shut out of Western financial markets and faces supply problems with some products, such as microchips, and many of its oligarchs and officials have also been subject to sanctions. Last month, Russia defaulted on its foreign obligations for the first time since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.
In parallel with its efforts to obtain the removal of sanctions - but also as part of them - Moscow seeks to keep the price of gas and oil very high worldwide, being one of the world's largest exporters of hydrocarbons. Among the measures taken by Moscow are interruptions of gas deliveries under the pretext of maintenance or repair work on pipelines and limiting or even stopping gas sales to some customers (see, for example, the French company Engie).
OBJECTIVE: Inducing the idea that Europe is in the hands of Russia and that it must yield in order to have gas for the winter.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Russia premeditated the gas crisis and its invasion of Ukraine, preparing the ground since 2021 not only militarily, by bringing troops to Ukraine's borders, but also through the maneuvers through which many European countries, including Romania, did not they were able to stock up for the winter of 2021-2022, which also led to a significant increase in prices on international markets. The Kremlin continued to maintain this situation even after the outbreak of the war.
Thus, in the first six months of the war, Russia earned about 158 ​​billion euros from the sale of hydrocarbons, while it spent about 100 billion dollars on the war in Ukraine. The EU imported 54% of these hydrocarbons, worth approximately 85 billion euros. Fossil fuel exports have contributed approximately €43 billion to Russia's federal budget since the start of the invasion, helping to finance war crimes in Ukraine.
The largest importer of fossil fuels was the EU (85.1 billion euros), followed by China (34.9 billion euros), Turkey (10.7 billion euros), India (6.6 billion euros), Japan ( 2.5 billion euros), Egypt (2.3 billion euros) and South Korea (2 billion euros).
Therefore, today's situation suits Russia. Moscow has every interest in the EU not applying new sanctions or reducing the volume of gas it buys from it, being a market that imports almost 150% more than China, the second largest importer of Russian gas, which anyway he procures it at a ridiculous price compared to the EU.
Russia is trying to play hard and says that it will stop gas deliveries to Europe, if the West does not lift the sanctions against it, and its propaganda, including that in Romania, tries to insert such narratives.
However, the reduction of exports to Europe does not have the expected impact. On July 26, 2022, EU energy ministers reached a political agreement on a 15% reduction in natural gas consumption for this winter. This reduction is voluntary, but could become mandatory in the event of a security of supply alert. Many European countries have diversified their sources of natural gas (France, for example, increased imports from Algeria and liquefied gas from the United States) and are still looking for new suppliers (Bulgaria wants to bring gas from Azerbaijan. Also, several countries have replenished their stockpiles for the winter and have underground storages almost full. Germany, the country most dependent on Russian gas, announced on August 28 that it was replenishing its gas stocks faster than expected, despite drastic cuts in deliveries from Russia and should reach the October target earlier. A target of reaching 85% of gas storage capacity by October ""should be reached by early September"" from current levels of 82%, he added the Minister of Economy and Climate in Germany, Robert Habeck. In addition, a program to transition to a carbon-neutral economy has been launched in the EU for several years, which involves the development of alternative, non-polluting energy sources ; they already provide part of the energy requirement.
As far as the Romanians are concerned, this ""gas card"" that Russia is trying to play, does not affect them very much and they would not have any reason to revolt. The warehouses where natural gas is stored are now full in proportion of almost 76% in Romania. Also, the reserve is 2.3 billion cubic meters, more than last year, announced the minister of energy, Virgil Popescu, on a television station. He also said that in November the level of storage will exceed 80%, and the authorities will manage to keep things under control in winter. Moreover, Romania has over 80% of its own gas production, so the dependence on Russia is one of the lowest in Europe.

In reality, we do not find any report or declaration of the IAEA experts in which this point of view is expressed, the cited source being, in fact, the pro-Russian separatist leader Evgheni Balitki.
NEWS: ""The members of the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) appreciated the role of the Russian army in the process of protecting the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant,"" the head of the State Military Administration of the Zaporozhye region, Evgheni Balitki, wrote on his telegram channel.
The IAEA praised the way the Russian army ensures security. There are 13 people at the central station who carry out the monitoring. For us, it is a guarantee that the plant will not be bombed again. In such a case, the documentation will take place at the level of a European structure"", said Balitki.
Previously, the IAEA mission arrived at the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant. The visit was determined by the regular bombing of the nuclear power plant by the Ukrainian side. The State Duma of the Russian Federation asked the IAEA to pressure Ukraine to stop bombing the plant, according to Dni.ru. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, declared that he managed to see the ""key elements"", RT writes.
NARRATIVE: The IAEA mission praised the Russian army for defending the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant from Ukrainian bombings.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there is no official position of the International Atomic Energy Agency in which the role of the Russian military is emphasized, which ""protects the nuclear plant from the bombings of the Ukrainian side"". This would mean the recognition of the legitimacy of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which is not within the competence of the IAEA.
The information in the Russian press is based on a statement by the separatist leader, Evgheni Balitki, self-proclaimed head of the Zaporizhia State Military Regional Administration. He represents the Kremlin in the localities occupied by Russian troops. Therefore, it is not a statement of legitimate Ukrainian officials. Russian propaganda intentionally uses names of occupation bodies similar to those of legal Ukrainian institutions in order to mislead public opinion.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) considers Balitki a collaborator of Russia, which initiated after February 24 of this year. the creation of civilian detachments with the aim of persecuting Ukrainians who have spoken out against the Russian authorities in the past. Evgheni Balitki was a member of the Party of Regions of the pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych and of the Opposition Platform, banned on the territory of Ukraine during martial law.
The Russian press only quotes Balitki, without providing links to other sources, repeating classic propaganda narratives about Russia's rescue of the Zaporizhia plant, which is ""systematically bombarded by the Ukrainian army"".
At the time of publication of the news on URA.RU, the International Atomic Energy Agency had not published any official report on the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. In other words, it is about a false narrative of the Russian media, based only on some statements of the separatist leaders.
The majority of the IAEA delegation left the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant on September 5, as planned, after several days of essential safety-related activity. Two experts remained part of the constant presence at the plant, according to the IAEA.
It should be noted that the IAEA mission arrived in Zaporozhye at the request of Kiev, and not Moscow. The Ukrainian government requested that the IAEA technicians perform a nuclear engineering audit at the Zaporozhye plant and not just inspection and surveillance tasks, as they have done until now.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. In August, the Russian press wrote that at the behest of the US, Kiev will cause a nuclear disaster in Zaporizhia, following another false narrative, according to which an explosion will be caused to hide the traces of American biological weapons laboratories.

In reality, the Russian forces amplified the conflict by participating in it, and Moscow's refusal to withdraw them, as promised, led to its perpetuation.
NEWS: ""The formation of the [Moldovenesti Dniester] republic within the USSR more than a year before its disintegration was the result of the struggle of the Transnistrians against the pressures of the nationalist forces that came to govern in Moldova. Transnistria strengthens its statehood and obtains international recognition.
[...]
In terms of maintaining peace in the region, Transnistria and the Russian military presence are the cornerstone of the regional security system."" NARRATIVES: 1. Separatism from the left of the Dniester was caused by Russophobia and the nationalism of the elites from Chisinau. 2. The Russian military has a beneficial role in ensuring peace and security in the region.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On September 2, 1990, a separatist enclave was created in the eastern region of the Republic of Moldova (then the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic), later called the Dniester Moldavian Republic. The pretext invoked by the Transnistrians was that the elites from Chisinau are nationalists.
In 1992, the political conflict turned into an armed one, resulting in hundreds of deaths, which ended after the signing of a cease-fire agreement between the then presidents of the Republic of Moldova and Russia, Boris Eltin and Mircea Snegur, respectively. The agreement also provided for the creation of a pacification mission on the Dniester, including Russian soldiers.
On the left bank of the Dniester there is also a warehouse from the USSR period, where approximately 20,000 tons of ammunition are kept, which is guarded by a Russian military contingent. Moscow has officially assumed on several occasions, including at the OSCE summit in Istanbul in 1999, the withdrawal of its ammunition and armed forces, a promise it has not fulfilled.
During the more than three decades, Chisinau and Tiraspol (the capital of the separatist region) have not reached a consensus. Transnistria was not recognized as an independent state except by a few other ex-Soviet enclaves, but it was always supported directly or indirectly by Moscow, including by supplying it with free gas, the cumulative value of which has so far exceeded 7 billion of dollars.
OBJECTIVE: To present the elites from Chisinau as Russophobes and nationalists, and Russia as a guarantor of security and peace in the region.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The separatism on the left of the Dniester was, in fact, fueled by the local Russian-speaking elites, supported by Moscow, in its intention to keep the union republics in the Kremlin's sphere of influence, just as it happened in the Caucasus area s in Ukraine, when there were attempts to move away from Russia.
In fact, by signing the peace agreement of 1992, the Russian Federation practically recognized its involvement in the armed conflict.
The Russian military presence in the region is considered by Chisinau as the main threat to the security of the Republic of Moldova, and since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, it is seen as a destabilizing factor for the entire region. Publication / Media:

The so-called news is a fabrication: there is no statement by Anthony Fauci regarding the production of viruses or other biological weapons in Ukraine.
NEWS: ""Chief epidemiologist Anthony Fauci resigned and started giving candid interviews. He admitted that American scientists worked on the production of the COVID-19 virus not only in Wuhan, China, but also in several biological laboratories in Ukraine, reports Fox News.
Asked why so many special laboratories were opened in Ukraine, Fauci said that ""very necessary experiments were carried out in the interest of US national security"".
""Laboratories are extremely dangerous and it is forbidden by law for anyone to operate them on the territory of the United States. We paid good money to the Ukrainians, they were happy,"" he said.
[...]
""It was not difficult to convince Kiev, we managed to open several laboratories even in China, especially in Wuhan. The Chinese only knew about some relatively safe activities, but not about all. The Ukrainians, on the other hand, had no idea about most of our experiments,"" he said.
In March, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that there were biological laboratories operating on the territory of Ukraine that used pathogenic agents of dangerous infections, as part of joint programs with the Pentagon.
NARRATIVE: An American epidemiologist confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was produced in laboratories in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Anthony Fauci did not say on Fox News that the US produced the COVID-19 virus in biological laboratories in Ukraine. Russia News, publishing this news, quotes an article from Fox News, but without a hyperlink. Only a screenshot is presented so that readers cannot verify the source.
In the article of the American television station, we do not find anywhere Fauci's statement, quoted by the Russian press, from which it can be concluded that the USA financed biological laboratories for the production of COVID-19 in Ukraine. The article only claims that Fauci may know more about the origin of COVID-19, but does not include statements from this epidemiologist.
In another article, American scientists were accused by a journalist of conducting experiments in Ukrainian laboratories and of working on COVID-19. The article appears in the ""Opinion"" column, the author does not provide any evidence, the theses being assumptions of the journalist, and in no way statements by Anthony Fauci, as the Russian press writes. The American magazine Science reacted to the Fox News editorial, calling the article a false narrative.
In other words, Fox News did not publish any statement by epidemiologist Anthony Fauci about biological laboratories in Ukraine where viruses were produced; Veridica has not identified any other source in which such a statement appears.
The history of this false narrative is older and since 2020 the US embassy in Kiev has reacted to it by stating that there is no American secret laboratory on the territory of Ukraine.
Later, in order to justify the invasion of Ukraine, Russian journalists reported about the biological laboratories, created and financed by the USA in Ukraine, where experiments were carried out based on the bat coronavirus. These propaganda messages are an attempt to wake up a wave of hatred of Russians towards Ukraine and the West, which, apparently, brought COVID-19 to their country, being a casus belli found post-factum by the Kremlin.
At the beginning of the invasion, Kremlin spokesmen declared that Russia had destroyed American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. In April, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine attacked Russian military positions with chemical and biological weapons, using military drones. In May, another false narrative was distributed, according to which the EU is afraid of tuberculosis originating from NATO laboratories in Ukraine. Recently, the Russian government media convinced the public that the US will cause a nuclear disaster in Ukraine to hide the traces of biological weapons laboratories. Publication / Media:

The narrative is contradicted by the opinion barometers.
NEWS: ""Monday, August 29, in the show ""What's in Gusa, si n capusa"", moderated by Cozmin Gusa on Radio Gold FM, the domestic political environment was analyzed through the lens of the sovereignist electoral offer, but also which personalities and parties register for the votes of the approximately 60% of Romanians who have nationalist aspirations. Asked how 60% of Romanians prefer nationalism and sovereignty, the prestigious analyst Petru Romosan answers: ""It's not only in Romania. It's also in France, and in Germany, Spain, etc. in Italy, the nationalist-sovereignist right has a good chance of winning in the September elections. It is the merit of the EU, which has irritated the peoples and nations. It is the merit of the decline of the American empire, which forces aid to Ukraine [...] What would be the evidence that someone is pursuing a sovereignist policy? There are two simple arguments: leaving the EU and NATO. I have not heard any sovereignist speak frankly about reporting to the EU, whether they want to or not remains in the EU. This is the absolute scale. I don't see how George Simion could be a sovereignist or a nationalist, concludes Petru Romosan."" NARRATIVES: 1. Most Romanians prefer parties with sovereignist policies, 2. Europeans and Romanians are losing confidence in the EU and NATO and want their countries to leave them because of the aid they give to Ukraine.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The West made a common front in the financial and military support of Ukraine, after the Russian invasion that started on February 24. Also, both the EU and non-EU NATO countries have imposed sanctions on Russia for its aggression.
In this context, Russia has accelerated its propaganda actions and seeks to generate disagreements within the EU on the principle of ""divide et impera"". On the one hand, Russia wants to undermine Western support for Ukraine. On the other hand, Moscow wants to block even more severe sanctions, such as a total block on Western imports of hydrocarbons from Russia, which would represent a severe blow to its economy. Finally, another Russian goal is, for years days, the destabilization of NATO, the EU and Western societies, something visible in disinformation and fake-news campaigns (the refugee crisis, Brexit, the presidential elections in the United States, etc.).
In Romania, Russia supports the extremist and nationalist forces with the aim of weakening the resilience and internal political coagulation, and the extremist AUR party is intensely courted by Russian propaganda and its agents of influence who march on the idea of ​​Euroscepticism and anti-NATO attitudes under the pretext of nationalism of the type primitive.
OBJECTIVE: The creation of false feelings of patriotism that would contradict the condition of Romania's EU and NATO member state among Romanians.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The percentage of 60% of Romanians who would believe in sovereignty and Romania's exit from the EU and NATO structures is unreal. The authors of these statements, Petru Romosan and Cozmin Gusa, do not provide the source of such a conclusion, but only circulate some figures not covered by factual bases.
Last month's INSCOP survey shows that only 14.6% of respondents believe that Romania should leave the European Union, a significant decrease compared to February 2022, when 22.4% were of this opinion.
Also, 83% of respondents opposed a ""Ro-Exit"", increasing compared to February 2022 when 74.7% had this opinion.
In parallel, only 11.9% of respondents, compared to 15.7% in February 2022, believe that Romania should leave NATO. Likewise, 86% believe that Romania should remain in NATO, compared to 81.2% in February.
Also, 50.5% of Romanians believe that the acquisition of advanced weapons from the USA helps to strengthen the Romanian Army. The percentage is slightly increasing compared to February 2022, when 48.5% of Romanians supported this point of view.
Two thirds of Romanians (65.7%) do not see the Russian army being able to reach Bucharest in five days, compared to 36% who disagreed with this statement in February 2022.
Nor is the theme of ""traditional values ​​defended by Russia in front of the declining West"", a frequent narrative of Russian propaganda, frequently dismantled by Veridica articles, one by one with Romanians. Only 24.7% of Romanians still believed in a such false narrative in May 2022, compared to 41.4% in February 2022.
The same survey reveals the fact that over 83% of Romanians believe that in the coming decades Romania must follow the direction of the West (EU, USA, NATO) from the point of view of political and military alliances.
Ask who they think is the main culprit for starting the war in Ukraine, 71.2% of Romanians mention Russia in another opinion poll from June. Romanians also nominated the USA (10.4%), Ukraine (4.5%), NATO (3.9%) and the EU (1.7%).
In another survey, regarding the competitive advantages that remain relevant for Romania in the post-pandemic period and the regional geopolitical context, carried out in July by the Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce AmCham, membership in the European Union remained in first place (87% ), followed by NATO membership status (63%).
Also, the April EU Eurobarometer shows a broad consensus among EU citizens from all EU member states in favor of the EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The majority of Europeans believe that, since the war began, the EU has shown solidarity (79%) and has been united (63%) and quick (58%) in its reaction. Respondents are broadly in favor of supporting Ukraine and its people.
In particular, more than nine out of ten respondents (93%) approve of providing humanitarian support to people affected by the war.
Also, 88% of Europeans approve of the idea of ​​welcoming people fleeing war into the EU, and 80% approve of the financial support given to Ukraine. On the other hand, 66% agree that ""Ukraine should join the EU when it is ready"", 71% believe that Ukraine is part of the European family and 89% feel sympathy for Ukrainians.
The Eurofond survey published on June 24 shows that solidarity is very high and translates into active and practical support measures, with 80% of respondents agreeing with the EU and national approaches to providing housing for refugees and over 84% of respondents supporting the EU and the states its members in providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
More than 70% of respondents agree with the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia, approximately two-thirds of them actually consider that stricter sanctions should be imposed.
This is the case especially in the Scandinavian countries, the Baltic states, Romania, Poland and Ireland. Even on the more sensitive issue of military support, 66% of respondents approve of the EU's military support for Ukraine (although 34% believe that the EU has done too much in this area).
Therefore, all the data presented above indicate that Romanians do not want an anti-European and anti-NATO type of sovereignty, while AUR, the party proposed by the two as being on this sovereignist segment, is rated by the most recent Avangarde survey with only 12% of Romanians' trust, decreasing with the fading of the pandemic crisis of COVID-19.
It should be mentioned that Liviu Dragnea, the former leader of the PSD, made a formation that campaigns for sovereignist policies, but the sympathy towards him is not even taken into account by the specialized polls.

In reality, practically nothing has changed in Chisinau in recent years regarding the status of the Russian language - Romanian speakers are often forced to switch to Russian when communicating with Russian speakers, cinemas broadcast movies dubbed in Russian, and TV channels, shows and Russian films abound in the audio-visual space.
NEWS: ""Russian language and literature, integral parts of Moldovan society, have been under pressure in recent years, at the initiative of Maia Sandu""
[...] ""There are only two cinemas left in Chisinau, which broadcast Western movies and cartoons. The decline was also partially caused by the pro-European authorities who imposed language barriers for Russian films and for the dubbing of Western films in Russian""
[...] ""On June 22, the Law on the protection of the local informational space entered into force. Broadcasting of news, analytical programs and films with military content from Russia is prohibited. Nobody cares that by banning Russian TV programs, the government of the Republic of Moldova violates point 2 of art. 13 of the Constitution which provides that ""the State recognizes and protects the right to preserve, develop and function the Russian language and other languages ​​spoken on the territory of the country."" NARRATIVE: The government in Chisinau undermines the role of the Russian language and violates the rights of national minorities.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is an ex-Soviet country in which the Russian language had a predominant status during the former USSR, being the language of the communist elites and the artificially increased minorities, especially Russians and Ukrainians.
According to the legislation adopted at the end of the Soviet period, the Russian language has the role of the language of interethnic communication. But the law was declared obsolete (obsolete) by the Constitutional Court. Meanwhile, the share of national minorities decreased, and according to the 2014 census, 82% of the population declared themselves Moldovan/Romanian (in 2004, 78% declared themselves Moldovan/Romanian), followed by Ukrainians - 6.6%, Gagauzians - 4 .6% and Russians - 4.4%.
Although the share of Russian-speaking minorities is decreasing, there are still politicians and parties that try to use minorities for electoral purposes, by promoting topics such as the declaration of the Russian language as the second ""state"" language.
Also, the messages from the Russian press about the alleged violation of the rights of the Russian-speaking minorities and the accusations against the government in Chisinau, being directly or indirectly compared with the one in Kiev, which the Kremlin accuses of ""Nazification"", have intensified.
The article from rubaltic.ru starts from a subject that, apparently, has nothing to do with politics - the deplorable state Moldovan cinema has reached and the disappearance of the Moldova Film studio (which belonged to Soviet cinema) after the collapse of the USSR. From the praises brought to the Soviet cinema, the author moves on to the unfounded statements related to the status of the Russian language.
OBJECTIVE: To present the Chisinau government as hostile to the Russian-speaking minorities of the Republic of Moldova.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The minorities in the Republic of Moldova continue to use the Russian language, without any impediment from the authorities; on the contrary, the Russian language can be heard frequently in the cities of the Republic of Moldova and is used even by native Romanian speakers when they interact with native Russian speakers. The cinemas that the author of the article is talking about still broadcast films dubbed in Russian or with Romanian subtitles. The Russian language is still studied in Romanian-language schools; moreover, about 16% of the schools are taught in Russian, which corresponds to the share of national minorities, so there can be no question of violating the right to education in Russian.
Finally, the law referred to does not prohibit the retransmission of TV stations from Russia. This does not allow the retransmission of certain categories of programs such as news and political shows produced in states that have not ratified the European Convention on cross-border television. The purpose of the law is to prevent manipulation, disinformation and propaganda disseminated by Russian media institutions, the overwhelming majority of which are controlled by the Kremlin and which have intensified with the Russian military intervention in Ukraine.

In reality, the EU does not have such centers on its territory, the European states have repeatedly condemned international terrorism and requested Russia to stop the armed aggression against Ukraine.
NEWS: ""A training center for saboteurs for operations in Donbass was created in the EU. The Czech authorities have created on their territory a training center for saboteurs and terrorists who will act against civilians in Donbass, the first deputy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Donetsk People's Republic, Serghei Pereseda, told journalists on Tuesday.
""We must especially mention the position of the Czech Republic. In fact, they have created training centers for saboteurs and terrorists who will act against civilians in Donbass. These centers operate under the leadership of instructors from the West. Something inadmissible is happening: on the territory of the military bases of the member states of the European Union, mercenaries and diversionists from third countries are being trained,"" said Pereseda, quoted by RIA NOVOSTI
""Ukrainian Evheni Karpenko planned to mine the Volodarsk administration building on the day of the referendum on the republic's entry into Russia, according to the authorities of the People's Republic of Donetsk, who informed Moscow about the participation of the Czech Republic in organizing a terrorist act"", writes RBK, adding that there are many Ukrainian terrorists trained on EU territory.""
NARRATIVE: Terrorists are being trained on EU territory who will act against civilians in Donbass.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The EU does not have training centers for saboteurs and mercenaries on its territory who will organize terrorist attacks against civilians in Donbass. EU member states have been involved in a series of international initiatives to combat terrorism. In June this year The European Council adopted conclusions on protection against terrorism. The Council invited member states to continue the exchange of information on foreign terrorist fighters and invited authorities to issue entry bans for third-country nationals who pose a threat to national security. So, legislatively, ideologically and from the point of view of the European values ​​assumed by the member states, the training of terrorists cannot take place in the EU.
Through this propaganda narrative, the Russian press is actually reacting to an announcement that the EU could prepare the Ukrainian military to use the new types of weaponry they receive from the West. The High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, said that the EU could create a training mission for the Ukrainian military, but the decision will be taken after the meeting of the European Defense Ministers in Prague. The head of European diplomacy emphasized that the mission could work alongside the common training centers, which are, among others, in the Czech Republic.
In addition, there is a diplomatic scandal between Russia and the Czech Republic after a statement by the Czech Foreign Minister, Jana Cernochova, about the murder of Daria Dughina, the daughter of the Russian geopolitician Aleksandr Dughin. She said that she primarily regrets the thousands of civilians killed by the Dughinist ideology. The representative of Russia at the UN accused Jana Cernochova of ""supporting terrorism"". In addition, in June the Czech Republic announced that it would support the designation of Russia as a terrorist state. In response, the Russian media launched a series of disinformation narratives regarding the foreign policy of the Czech Republic.
Speaking about the Ukrainian Evheni Karpenko, who, apparently, was preparing a terrorist act, the Russian media does not provide any evidence. It is a terrorism present only in the Russian media, not on the ground.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the support of ""extremists"" and ""Nazis"" in Ukraine by the EU. In April, the Russian press wrote that the French gendarmes will hide the traces of the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea, and in June - that the EU will deport refugee men to Ukraine to be enlisted in the Ukrainian army. Starting with February 24 a.c. Russian propaganda reported weekly about Ukrainian Nazis and terrorists killing Russian-speaking civilians with the support of the West. Publication / Media:

In reality, Russia launched a war of expansion, causing thousands of deaths and widespread destruction.
NEWS: ""The population of Ukraine has been processed for several years with the help of certain technologies, and to overcome the consequences of the propaganda of the Kiev regime, time is needed,"" said former Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov in an interview for Ukraina.ru
He made a comparison with Nazi Germany, when the Germans, ""an educated nation, were deceived so much that they considered the massacre of Jews and dissidents, the burning of books to be absolutely normal"".
He also listed the objective conditions that make Ukrainians believe in Kiev's propaganda. The entry of Russian troops into Ukraine as part of the special operation is interpreted as an occupation, and this is in line with the regime's propaganda of the last 8 years, Azarov said.
In order to overcome the consequences of the propaganda from Kiev, the politician proposes to organize a movement to liberate Ukraine.
""Ukrainians must liberate Ukraine. Well, they themselves will not be able to under the conditions of the fascist regime. Of course, this is possible together with allies,"" said Mykola Azarov, ex-prime minister of Ukraine.""
NARRATIVE: Due to Kiev's neo-Nazi propaganda, Ukrainians do not understand that they are liberated from Russia, and not occupied.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The website Ukraina.ru, which is part of the government media trust Russia Today, accuses the Ukrainian authorities of having ""worked"" the population for 8 years with the help of disinformation and neo-Nazi propaganda, and from this because the Ukrainians are not able to understand that Russia came to liberate them, not to occupy them. To give more credibility to this narrative in the eyes of Russian public opinion, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov is quoted.
Azarov has been on the territory of Russia since 2014 and has been engaged for years in an effort to discredit the Ukrainian authorities in the Russian and Ukrainian press. In March 2021, the Security and National Defense Council of Ukraine introduced sanctions against Mykola Azarov. The former Ukrainian Prime Minister, who led the most pro-Russian Government in the history of Ukraine, is accused of having the citizenship of the aggressor state (Russia) and promoted during the interviews given various anti-Ukrainian theses about Ukrainian ""Nazism"" and the transformation of the country into a colony of the West. He did not appear at the court hearings in which he was accused of taking bribes in large proportions, tax evasion and launching calls in 2015 for a coup d'état in Ukraine, which would bring to power pro- Therefore, Azarov transmits the messages of the Kremlin in the press, totally dependent on the Russian political elite.
Azarov's statements are based on the metanarrative ""Ukraine is a Nazi state"" built over the last years by the Russian media. This has been used, moreover, since 2014 to justify Russia's aggression in Ukraine.
In July 2015, Ukraine banned by law any public display of communist and Nazi ideology, so the claim that Nazi propaganda is made is meaningless.
Russia's actions in Ukraine after February 24 a.c. they cannot in any case be called liberation, being an unprovoked aggression against an independent state - a continuation of the annexation of Crimea and the support of separatist movements in Donbass; the conflict shows the characteristics of an imperial war of conquest. 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted a resolution condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Only 5 states, including Russia, voted against. With the help of specialists from abroad, Kiev is collecting evidence to prove that Russia has committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine and that it is a terrorist state. Publication / Media:

Growth technology will help you in all stages of life: children in a learning environment, professionals at work and ambitious seniors. There are many possibilities""
NARRATIVES: 1. The ""World Occult"" is preparing the ground to implant microchips in children's bodies to control their minds. 2. Under the guise of technological progress, they are trying to transform people into controllable robots.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: The World Economic Forum published on its website an editorial by the general director and researcher of the Holst Center in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, who explained why, for more effective treatments, advanced technology is needed to replace traditional medication .
The portal warns, moreover, that this article ""has been intentionally misrepresented on sites that spread false information"". The author also recommends a careful reading of the reasons presented by her for medical purposes, in order to avoid misrepresentation of the arguments presented .
OBJECTIVE: Inducing the idea among public opinion that advanced technology in the field of medicine aims to control some occult forces over people.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FAKE: The idea of ​​a ""world occult"" that seeks to gain control over humanity or is already guiding it in the shadows is found in numerous conspiracy theories, including the one regarding the Davos Economic Forum, which some identify with the supposed occult.
Various conservative groups believe that the so-called ""world occult"" wants to control humanity by distancing it from the Church. Many of them are supported, in recent years, by Russia through the Russian oligarch and banker Konstantin Malofeev, currently on the blacklist of the sanctions imposed by the USA and the EU for involvement in the war in Ukraine.
Malofeev controls the Russian conservative movement and the propaganda actions on this ultra-conservative segment. He is the sponsor of several foundations and media institutions that promote conservative themes, supports radical and anti-vaxxer movements.
To increase the emotional impact, those who spread these fake news also resort to emotional factors that involve children. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 66% of Romanians believed the conspiracy theories promoting the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and the ""world occult"".
Moreover, the article in question talks about the technological advance that can now be used to treat serious diseases, without requiring the consumption of pills, or to prevent a series of allergies that can be fatal in the case of some people.
The author talks about a series of devices, as in the past there were hearing aids for the hearing impaired.
She also explains that gadgets that monitor, for example, heartbeat and pulse have become normal accessories today. The author also talks about these chips in children for safety reasons and explains that ethical arguments must be the basis of such decisions, not necessarily technological capabilities. Therefore, it expresses a medical point of view and emphasizes increased safety.
Moreover, the World Economic Forum portal says that it does not assume the editorial content and that the opinions belong to the author, while the Activenews.ro portal uses a deceptive title that directly says that ""the World Economic Forum supports the microchipping of CHILDREN"", after which it comes with arguments religious of an emotional type by invoking a monk - Iustin Parvu - and his prophecies.
THE NUTS OF THE TRUTH: There are technologies that allow the implantation of chips in the human body, but only with the consent of the persons concerned, the most frequent cases being for medical purposes. Publication / Media:

In reality, no Western state is interested in a nuclear incident, especially since it could have a global impact, and the biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine are an invention of Russian propaganda.
NEWS: ""The Ukrainian government is a puppet. All decisions are coordinated in one way or another by the Western secret services. Therefore, we must not rule out that the purpose of the bombing of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant is to cause a nuclear disaster. The USA, which is on the other side of the ocean, will not suffer from this catastrophe, and the explosion is likely to hide many dirty secrets. It is, for example, the dangerous laboratories that were involved in the creation of biological weapons in Ukraine.
It is possible that in this way they want to hide under the umbrella of pollution the traces of the activity of the biological weapons laboratories or they simply want to destroy a part of the Russian world"".
NARRATIVE: The US will cause a nuclear disaster in Ukraine to hide the traces of biological weapons laboratories.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: An explosion at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe can have a global impact, on the principle of the domino effect, given that the radioactive cloud affects a large territory. Depending on the atmospheric conditions and the extent of the explosion, it is possible that all countries will be affected, including the USA, even if, according to the Russian media, ""it is on the other side of the ocean"". Moreover, there are precedents: the Chernobyl nuclear disaster - a plant smaller than Zaporizhia - created a radioactive cloud that affected the entire northern hemisphere and a total of three billion people. The accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant had a slightly smaller global impact, but it led to a rethink in the whole world of the role of nuclear power plants and had long-term effects on energy markets.
The USA has repeatedly asked Russia to stop the destabilizing actions in the perimeter of the plant, which put the future of humanity in danger. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken qualified the actions of the Russian army as ""the height of irresponsibility"".
The position of the USA and other Western countries, interested in ensuring nuclear security around the world, was presented in 2016 at the UN, when a resolution was adopted, according to which the international community undertakes never to repeat the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which took place on the territory of Ukraine on April 26, 1986. Any nuclear disaster will bring damage to the whole world, and not just to a separate state, according to the resolution.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has repeatedly demanded that Russian forces leave the perimeter of the nuclear power plant in Zaporozhye, which they took under their control in March, shortly after the start of the invasion on February 24. The UN has also launched a call for the demilitarization of the central area.
On the other hand, Russia accuses Ukraine of bombing the plant, and the Russian government press writes that it is doing it at the behest of the West. ""It does not occur to anyone that Ukraine could strike its own nuclear power plant, creating an enormous risk of a nuclear catastrophe on its own territory,"" said the Ukrainian ambassador to the UN, Sergey Kislita. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of regarding the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant
At the same time, the Russian press returns to the topic of biological weapons laboratories on the territory of Ukraine. This time the two false narratives, which were distributed separately from each other in the last 6 months, were merged into a single metanarrative.
In reality, there were no US-funded biological weapons production laboratories in Ukraine. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons. In spite of this fact, in recent years the Russian press has drawn the attention of the public opinion in the post-Soviet states to some American-Ukrainian projects in the field of biological research. The agreement between Ukraine and the USA in this field is presented by the Russian media as an element of the production of biological weapons. In reality, such collaboration agreements also exist in the case of other post-Soviet states, and until 2012 the USA also cooperated with Russia in this field. The history of this false narrative is older and since 2020 the US embassy in Kiev has reacted to it by stating that there is no American secret laboratory on the territory of Ukraine.
So far, Moscow has not presented any concrete evidence that there was any laboratory for the production of biological weapons in Ukraine. The topic of biological laboratories was used by the Russian press as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine. Often, the bombing of Ukrainian cities was presented as an attempt to destroy American laboratories.
Veridica dismantled a series of fake news on this topic. In March, the Russian press wrote that the coronavirus was produced in secret laboratories in Ukraine. At the beginning of the invasion, Kremlin spokesmen declared that Russia had destroyed American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine.

The false narrative, which ignores the external causes of inflation, is promoted by the pro-Russian opposition in Chisinau and publications close to it. Bloknot-moldova.ru illustrates it with a collage that shows Maia Sandu next to a woman preparing tizic, a mixture of straw and dung used for heating.
NEWS: ""One year of PAS government has brought people to despair. They hope that the government will help them, or they will have to switch to tizic.
[...]
Consumer prices in May, compared to May 2021, increased by 29.05%. First of all, services increased by 35.07%"" NARRATIVES: 1. Brought to the brink of despair by the economic crisis, the population of the Republic of Moldova will be forced to warm themselves with tizic. 2. The pro-European PAS government (Maia Sandu) is to blame for the rampant inflation. 3 (Indirect) A pro-Russian government would have ensured a better life for the citizens of the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is facing the highest price increase in the last at least 20 years and is registering the highest inflation in Europe (with the exception of Turkey). In July, the annual inflation exceeded 30%. In particular, food products have become more expensive, but also energy resources (fuels by over 66%, gas by approximately three times, etc.).
The opposition, especially the pro-Russian one, blames the government for this situation, the main argument being that the pro-European authorities in Chisinau could not sign a favorable contract with Gazprom that would ensure the Republic of Moldova lower gas prices.
OBJECTIVE: To fuel the population's dissatisfaction with the pro-European government in Chisinau. To inoculate the idea that a pro-Russian government would have managed the situation better.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Inflation started to rise worldwide starting with the second half of 2021 as a result of the economic recovery after the pandemic crisis of the previous year and the increase in demand for raw materials and services.
In the Republic of Moldova, the highest increase in prices is recorded due to excessive dependence on Russian gas and energy products in general (the Republic of Moldova imports all fuel and gas requirements and produces a small share of green energy, and the rest of the electrical energy requirements imports it, or produces it all from imported resources).
Another factor that led to the excessive increase in prices is the high dependence on transport routes from Ukraine, especially the port of Odessa, blocked due to Russian military intervention.
Also, this year's drought, together with the increase in fuel prices, also caused an increase in the prices of food products, especially vegetables.
It is true that the Republic of Moldova also faces its own internal dysfunctions such as monopolies, a large number of intermediaries, expensive loans, problems that have accumulated over the years and also influence the increase in prices. Most of these problems were inherited by the PAS government, which did not have the time - or the conditions - to regulate them, even when the policy existed.
The article on Blokknot-moldova.ru is illustrated with a collage of the president Maia Sandu next to an old woman doing tizic, suggesting that the citizens of the Republic of Moldova would have reached this heating method. However, there is no data to support this statement.

The article was published before the cause of death was known or if the young woman was vaccinated or not.
NEWS: ""Basketball player Alessia Maria Raiciu died suddenly, on Monday, on the day she turned 18, announced the Romanian Basketball Federation, quoted by StiripeSource. ""The flight of a basketball player with a real perspective was ended much too early... One of the most talented athletes of the 2004 generation is no longer with us. Alessia Maria Raiciu died on the day she turned 18"", FRB announces on its Facebook page.

""The Romanian Basketball Federation sends its sincere condolences to the bereaved family! Rest in Peace, Alessia!"", the representatives of the Federation write. The young woman was found dead at home yesterday. It seems that the athlete had a suspicious death. For now, the cause of death is unknown, but investigations are being carried out in this case""
NARRATIVE: Vaccination against the coronavirus causes death even among young people.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Ever since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a series of false narratives have appeared in Romania regarding its nature and origin, the measures taken to combat its spread, the effectiveness and effects of vaccination. Among those who promoted these false narratives regarding SARS-CoV-2 are adherents of various conspiracy theories, people who emphasize a radical orthodoxy and support those prelates who also contested the anti-Covid measures (the exponent who the most important of them being the archbishop of Tomis, Teodosie), representatives of the Coalition for the Family, sovereignists, Euro-skeptics, anti-Westerners, followers of protochronism, people who over time promoted Russia's messages in Romania and/or were promoted intensively by the spokeswoman of the Kremlin, Sputnik.
In the context of the increase in cases of infection with COVID-19 this month in Romania and the official recommendations to wear a mask again in crowded spaces, conspiracy sites in Romania, such as Activenews.ro, continue the series of fake news and disinformation about to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In support of the serious claims, the portal does not present any medical evidence. I put the lack of evidence on the back of the ""omerta"" in the medical field regarding the deaths allegedly caused by the vaccine against COVID-19.
Also, Activenews.ro seeks to validate its conspiracy theories through pseudo-experts and anonymous websites or through the truncated amount of information from various studies.
Veridica has already dismantled several fake news and misinformation about the anti-Covid vaccine - that it would cause sterility for three (sic!) generations, that it would affect the performance of tennis player Simona Halep at the Australian Open, or that it would not be effective and would have serious adverse effects. The last two also appeared on ActiveNews, a portal that also published numerous articles in which the death of some people was attributed to vaccination.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the anti-vaccine culture and inducing fear among those who get vaccinated against COVID-19 or who would intend to get vaccinated.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: Without having any evidence in this regard, the author of the article induces from the title the idea that the athlete's death would have occurred due to the vaccination against COVID-19.
In reality, it was not known until the publication date of the article, August 15, whether the young woman was vaccinated against COVID-19, nor the exact cause of death.
The first information in this regard came only on August 16, after lunch, when the president of the Romanian Basketball Federation, Carmen Tocala, declared on Antena 3 that the athlete died in her sleep on Sunday morning, when she was found breathless in her apartment, without signs of violence on her body.
The cause of death officially established by doctors is acute pulmonary edema. For now, the causes are unknown and the results of the anatomo-pathology and toxicology examinations are awaited.
Pulmonary edema is a condition caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary interstitium and alveolar space with extravasation of fluid and its reabsorption through the lymphatic channels. As a result of this accumulation of liquid in the lung, the alveolo-capillary exchange surface is altered and thus the oxygen saturation in the peripheral blood decreases, according to the description on the Medicover clinic website.
""Most frequently, sudden death can be myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or major rhythm disorder. Not all these pre-existing conditions can be observed in the routine investigations that are done for athletes, but they can be latent or occult, which is why you can end up in this unfortunate situation of sudden death"", said sports doctor Pompiliu Popescu on Antena 3 .

This is used by politnavigator.net and taken over by news-front.ru to justify possible response measures from Moscow.
NEWS: ""The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again drew attention to the situation in Moldova. The deputy director of the information and press department of the Russian MFA, Ivan Neceaev, in a briefing, emphasized that a large number of Russian citizens live in Moldova. First of all, Moscow is alarmed by the situation related to the free press in Moldova.
The Moldovan authorities put open pressure on the free and opposition press. The informational space is cleaned of opinions and evaluations inappropriate to the authorities, said Neceaev.
[...]
The West, which is the real master of Moldova and the one that controls its media space, stopped hiding the violation of the right to free expression a long time ago. Any mass media that expresses a position unfavorable to the Euro-Atlantic states is declared a propaganda organ and closed. No orator, neither from the West, nor from the states they control, presented clear criteria to differentiate between coverage of events and ""propaganda"".
[...]
The appeal of the Russian MFA to the authorities of the Republic of Moldova ""to review its policy of undermining the rights and freedoms of its own citizens and to take the necessary measures to ensure their full compliance"" will most likely be ignored by Chisinau. There is no doubt that they want the same service requests, ""to evacuate the military troops from the territory of the Republic of Moldova"" and to stop the war in Ukraine. NARRATIVES: The authorities in Chisinau violate the right to free expression and freedom of the press. 2. Chisinau is behaving provocatively towards Moscow, which will have to react.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is the most vulnerable and exposed country in Central and Eastern Europe to Russian propaganda, according to the study ""Resistance to disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe"", carried out in 2018. It analyzed to what extent the 14 monitored states are vulnerable to Russian propaganda based on three indicators: the extent to which the population is exposed to disinformation and propaganda; countermeasures by the state; vulnerability to digital warfare.
The study finds that in the Republic of Moldova there are three large groups more likely to be manipulated by the mass media than the rest of the population. It is about ethnic minorities, speaking the Russian language, which represent almost 20% of the population; some active parishioners of the Moldovan Orthodox Church, who obey the Russian Orthodox Church and who can be influenced by it; and the over 700,000 elderly people, whose average education level is lower than that of the rest of the population.
And internal monitoring reports found that Russian TV stations rebroadcast in the Republic of Moldova were used as propaganda tools.
In 2018, the Parliament voted a law that prohibited the broadcast of certain categories of programs such as news, political debates and military broadcasts from states that have not ratified the European Convention on Transborder Television, among these states the Russian Federation. However, the provisions were canceled in 2020 by a parliamentary majority led by the Socialist Party, Filorus.
Parliament voted a similar law on June 2, in an attempt to reduce disinformation in the context of the war in Ukraine.
The Information and Security Service has blocked, since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, several websites that distributed fake news, information that incites hatred, war or violence. These are online resources in both Russian and Romanian.
Lately, the Russian press, pro-Russian politicians from the Republic of Moldova, but also official Moscow have criticized the Chisinau authorities for putting pressure on the Russian-language and Russian-language media.
OBJECTIVE: To present the Chisinau government as anti-democratic, which violates the rights of Russian citizens and to justify possible punitive actions from Moscow.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The authorities in Chisinau have taken several measures, in recent months, after the Russian invasion, against propaganda and disinformation, but they have not been directed strictly against the media from Russia or from another country. The law prohibiting the broadcast of certain categories of broadcasts on TV refers to a certain category of states - those that have not ratified the European Convention on cross-border television. SIS also blocked websites in Romanian and Russian, as well as the Broadcasting Council warned and fined both Romanian and Russian language stations. The fact that these measures affect the Russian-language media only shows that it is involved in the massive spread of fake news and disinformation.
The Republic of Moldova rose in the Press Freedom Index, developed by the international organization Reporters Without Borders (RFF), from 89th place in 2021 to 40th place this year.
NUTS OF TRUTH: In the Republic of Moldova, some measures have been taken in the fight against disinformation and propaganda, which often affects the pro-Kremlin press, which often publishes disinformation and fake news.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration from Chisinau rejected the ""allegations"" made by the statements of the Deputy Director of the Information and Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Moscow, Ivan Neceaev
""This statement does not correspond to the objective evaluations and in accordance with the European and international standards formulated by prestigious press freedom monitoring organizations, as well as the international organizations to which our country is a party"", it is shown in a comment of the spokesperson of MAEIE, Daniel Voda.
""The authorities will continue their sustained efforts to contribute to correct information and to building a civil society and a mass media independent of any interests, emphasizing that pluralism, independence and the safety of journalists are basic components of the right to free expression and information, being essential for democratic functioning in accordance with our aspirations to join the European Union"", according to the diplomacy from Chisinau.

He also writes that Maia Sandu is preparing a coup against herself. The narratives aim to discredit the pro-European government in Chisinau and destabilize the internal situation in the Republic of Moldova.
NEWS: ""What is behind the accusations against the ""pro-Russian forces"" regarding the overthrow of power?"" - the Mejdurecie portal, writes that during the visit to Bucharest, answering the questions of the Romanian media, Maia Sandu referred to the possibility of the overthrow of the current government pro-European forces by the pro-Russian forces, who make a common front with the criminal groups, to prevent reforms, especially that of justice. The publication claims that there are no pro-Russian parties and forces in the Republic of Moldova and in this sense quotes the political scientist of the State Agency ""Rossiya Segodnya"" (Russia Today), Rostislav Isenko. In his opinion, ""in general, the pro-Russian course of the socialists from Chisinau, and earlier of the communists, consisted in the fact that, without changing the pro-European strategic political path, he maintained good economic relations with Russia, because Moldova has nowhere to get energy resources, and the agricultural products from the orchards and Moldovan fields cannot be sold elsewhere"". The publication also writes that ""the government intentionally causes the break of relations with the Russian concern Gazprom"" and refuses to negotiate with it.
In the author's opinion, several scenarios would be prepared, including: the destruction of the opposition, ""the staging of protests by left-wing forces and the banning of the PSRM, the Sor Party, or the declaration of a state of war"", creating chaos against the background of the energy crisis in the world ""Moldova is part of the scenario, that's why the power acts in unison with other Western governments. After chaos, society demands order and new tough measures of political, financial control, etc. will be imposed, and the leadership of the Republic of Moldova will act according to general instructions [...] Foreign troops could be introduced into Moldova. The country will come under the total protectorate of the West"", comments the publication. She also writes that in some circles in Romania there are rumors that ""the head of state serves the interests of Russia and Germany."" The leadership's mission is to create conditions for forces loyal to Moscow and Berlin to return to government.""
The publication writes that there is another scenario, in which a ""successor"" of Maia Sandu would be prepared, and that this would be the new head of the Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office, Veronica Dragalin, who was a federal prosecutor in the USA, who would look similar in physical appearance with Maia Sandu and that, likewise, he had a high position in Washington. NARRATIVES: 1. There are no pro-Russian parties and forces in the Republic of Moldova. 2. Moldova cannot procure gas from anywhere other than Russia. 3. Moldova has no other market for its products than Russia. 4. The government intentionally causes the break of relations with Gazprom. 5. The government of PAS and Maia Sandu is causing chaos to introduce foreign troops and the country will come under the protectorate of the West. 6. The United States is preparing a successor to Maia Sandu.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to discredit the pro-European government in Chisinau and to excuse the pro-Russian opposition, which has criminal problems, being accused of corruption; to destabilize the internal situation in the Republic of Moldova and at the same time to accuse the authorities of ceding control of the country to the West.
CONTEXT: Since taking power in 2021, the pro-Western government of Maia Sandu has faced the most serious crises in the history of the Republic of Moldova - the gas crisis, against the backdrop of fuel prices on international markets, and as a result - record inflation and price increases to products and services. At the same time, the Republic of Moldova is seriously affected by the war in the neighboring country Ukraine, hosting almost a hundred thousand refugees; in addition, access to eastern markets is difficult. At the same time, Chisinau is subject to a military risk from the Transnistrian separatist zone, supported by Russia, not controlled by the constitutional authorities of the Republic of Moldova, where Russian ammunition is stored and there are two Russian contingents, to which the separatist forces are added. On the other hand, the national army of the Republic of Moldova is poorly equipped and insufficiently prepared to face a possible aggression.
The former president Igor Dodon, who is under house arrest, has threatened several times with protests and that the population will freeze in the winter, in the context of the risk that Gazprom will stop gas deliveries to the Republic of Moldova. Another party with criminal problems, led by the fugitive Ilan Sor, also threatened that Moldova will endure hunger, cold and poverty. There were several protests organized by the opposition, including in the Gagauz region, but they were not large-scale.
In recent weeks, dozens of false bomb alarms have been registered, targeting state institutions and public places. The authorities declared that these alerts are concerted, they come from outside the country and they aim to destabilize the situation in the Republic of Moldova, representing an element of the hybrid war, creating unrest and panic among the population.
At the end of last month, President Maia Sandu paid a visit to Bucharest, where she spoke about the vulnerabilities of the Republic of Moldova. She declared during a press conference that she will ask for Romania's help in case Russia tries to attack the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Parties promoting rapprochement with Russia have always existed in the Republic of Moldova; they were permanently represented in the legislature and were in government throughout several electoral cycles. There are parties supported mostly by elderly people, by Russian speakers, but also by citizens manipulated by their affiliated media and by the Russian media that dominates the Moldovan information space. The Party of Socialists led by Igor Dodon, for example, promotes a policy of rapprochement with the Russian Federation and accession to the Eurasian Union, boasting that it had obtained observer status within this organization. The PSRM was financed in electoral campaigns with obscure money coming from the Russian Federation, in the case of the Bahamas. Moreover, the former president of the Republic of Moldova is even accused of collaborating with the Russian special services, under the pseudonym Kremlinovici.
Regarding the narrative that Moldova cannot procure gas from sources other than Russia, this is a false one. Moldova is really dependent on external energy resources, but with the construction of the Iasi-Ungheni gas pipeline, it can procure gas from other sources as well, as happened last fall, during the energy crisis, when for the first time in its history the Republic Moldova procured gas from markets other than the Russian one. The current government is not interested in breaking contractual relations with Gazprom, as the author of the article suggests, on the contrary, the authorities have declared that they will do everything possible to ensure that citizens have gas in the winter. Moldova has already signed a 5-year contract with Gazprom, which was negotiated last year in the presence of Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spanu. On the other hand, it is known that the Russian concern Gazprom is used by the Kremlin as an instrument of pressure on countries dependent on Russian gas.
And the narrative that Moldova has no other market for its products than Russia is false. The most important market for Moldovan goods is the European one, where approximately 65% ​​of exports go. According to official data, exports of goods destined for the countries of the European Union (EU-27), only in the period January-May 2022, totaled 1208.1 million dollars, holding a weight of 64.4% in total exports. On the other hand, exports of goods to the CIS countries, in January-May 2022, had a value of 284.5 million dollars, which is equivalent to a share of 15.2% in total exports. In January-May 2022, the main export destination countries were: Romania (30.4% of total exports), Italy (9.4%), Turkey (9.2%), Ukraine (8.4%), Germany (5.7%), Russian Federation (4.9%). Moldovan exports to Russia dropped significantly, starting in 2014, due to the embargo on Moldovan products introduced by Moscow in response to the signing of the Moldova-EU Association Agreement. The Kremlin has used economic blackmail and embargoes on Moldovan products several times as instruments of political pressure on Chisinau, making the Russian market an unsafe one for Moldovan producers. At the same time, in the context of the war and the restriction of access to the eastern market, the EU increased the export quotas for several Moldovan products.
The author contradicts himself several times in this text. First of all, he says right in the title that Maia Sandu would prepare a coup, but it turns out that it would be a coup against herself, Maia Sandu being the head of the state, together with the party founded by her, PAS.
Although it admits that it has an element of conspiracy, the publication launches yet another contradictory narrative, that Maia Sandu would serve the interests of Russia and Germany and at the same time would have the mission to create conditions for the government to return forces loyal to Moscow and Berlin.
Another misinformation that has a logic that is difficult to understand is that Maia Sandu will be replaced by a person who looks like her in physical appearance, which in the author's opinion would be Veronica Dragalin, promoted by the USA, just as Maia Sandu would have been promoted, who returned to the Republic of Moldova from the USA.

This refers to a text published in Foreign Affairs by the former adviser to the head of European diplomacy. In reality, the words of the Italian specialist were taken out of context, and her text in support of Ukraine was presented as being pro-Russian.
NEWS: ""The former adviser to the head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell, Nathalie Tocci, believes that some of the countries of the European Union will gradually move to Russia's side and will ask Ukraine to make concessions to Moscow, Foreign Affairs writes.
She believes that the main danger standing in the way of the European coalition may be a relative calm in this conflict, which will allow the Kremlin to attract some EU states to its side.
She also stated that the reason for the division within the EU on the topic of supporting the Ukrainian authorities in the special operation will be the possible completion of the active phase of hostilities. This can happen with a high probability if the energy crisis in Europe starts to deepen, said Tocci"".
NARRATIVE: The EU states will ask Ukraine to surrender to Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The statements of the former advisor to the head of European diplomacy were taken out of context and presented intentionally wrongly by the Russian media in order to convince the public opinion that the ""special military operation"" is being carried out successfully, and the EU states will step by step pass on the side of Moscow.
In reality, Nathalie Tocci did not write that the EU will ask Kiev to give in. On the contrary, her message was one of encouraging European solidarity to stop Russian aggression. It is worth mentioning that the Russian press does not cite the article via hyperlink, but publishes links to the home page of Foreign Affairs magazine.
Nathalie Tocci writes in the article, Will Russia succeed in dividing Europe? ""Why a false peace can be worse than a long war"" that the EU must not go against Russia, so it must not give in. The conclusion of Borell's former adviser is the opposite of the one presented by the Russian press. Nathalie Tocci writes that during truce, the EU must double its support for Kiev, ""not only to guarantee that Russia will be defeated, but to make possible Ukraine's victory in the war"". Tocci does not ask the European leaders to cooperate with Russia or to pressure Kiev to give in to Moscow.
She admits that the EU could become much more divided in the context of the energy crisis, adding that a fake peace with Russia will be worse than a good war. Tocci emphasizes that the EU's renunciation of support for Ukraine can generate a wave of nationalism and populism in the EU. ""If nationalist Europe is possible, nationalist EU is terminological nonsense,"" according to the article published by Foreign Affairs.
Therefore, Nathalie Tocci did not write that the EU states will ask Kiev to yield to Russia. It should be noted that the Russian press emphasized the past function of the Italian specialist in EU structures, without mentioning that Tocci signed the article as director of the Institute of International Relations in Rome, and her opinion does not represent the position of some EU member states.

This was published by Sorin Rosca Stanescu, a former collaborator of the Security and a criminal convict who spread numerous misinformation in the public space.
NEWS: ""The war in Ukraine can be extended for another 50 years. Why? Simply because Volodymyr Zelensky is preparing a law by which, for 50 years, the Russians will be prohibited from stepping on the territory of Ukraine. This means something extraordinary so far in history. Practically, this will lead to a conflict that will last 50 years, a kind of war from the point of view of the right of people, the citizens of the planet, to travel to each other's states. Let's not forget the fact that the Russian Federation is the largest state in the world and at the same time, obviously, the largest neighbor of Ukraine, independent of this war that will end at some point.""
NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine will be guilty of prolonging the war started by Russia on its territory 2. Volodymyr Zelensky is the one who maintains the war in Ukraine.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: From the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, Russian and pro-Russian propaganda pedaled the idea that Ukraine violates the rights of ethnic Russians living in this country. For this purpose, the ""demilitarization and denazification"" of Ukraine was ordered through a so-called special operation.
Last week, the leaders from Kiev and Moscow spoke veiledly of the possibility of negotiations for peace, and the Russian press presented this episode as one that was prevented by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Incidentally, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Alexei Arestovici declared on Monday evening, on the Moldovan public station Moldova 1, that Ukraine will not allow the war that Russia is waging on its territory to reach the stage of a frozen conflict. ""We will kick them out at one gate"", declared Arestovici, rejecting any possibility of territorial losses for Ukraine in this war.
For his part, Zelenski asked the West on Tuesday, in an interview for the Washington Post, to prohibit the access of Russian citizens to the territory of democratic countries, not only of Russian officials.
Sorin Rosca Stanescu, former collaborator of the Security and convicted for corruption and setting up an organized criminal group. Sorin Rosca Stanescu published false narratives related to Ukraine even before the start of the war and continued even after February 24, stating, for example, that the Black Sea will blow up because of Ukrainian mines (a myth initially launched by the Soviets), or that Vladimir Putin will be forced to resort to nuclear weapons.
OBJECTIVE: Presenting Zelenski as a leader who does not want peace and continues alleged abuses against Russians.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Civil society in Ukraine signed a petition demanding the ban on Russians' access to Ukraine for the next 50 years; it is therefore not an initiative of Volodimir Zelenski, as Sorin Rosca Stanescu claims. The petition was already signed by a minimum of 25,000 people and thus reached the official circuit, and now it should be considered by the president Volodymyr Zelenski.
""Mr. President, Ukraine has been suffering for 8 years from the war that Russia started on the territory of our country. Unfortunately, in these 8 years, the authorities failed to protect Ukraine from saboteurs, agents and corrections officers, who all this time arrived in Ukraine through the visa-free regime with Russia. I paid for it with thousands of lives. For the sake of the safety of every Ukrainian, now and in the future, we propose to completely close the entry to Ukraine for all Russians in the next 50 years and not to issue residence permits to Russians, with the exception of those who fought on the side of Ukraine. in the Russian-Ukrainian war"", says the text of the petition.
Zelenki has not yet made any official statement on this subject.
Even if such a law were to be adopted, this in no way means that the war will continue for 50 years. In international relations, there are or have been similar situations - for example, in a number of Arab countries, the entry of Israeli citizens and even people, regardless of nationality, who have visited Israel, is prohibited, which does not mean that those countries are at war with Israel for more than 50 years.

In reality, against the background of the country's depopulation and traffic restrictions, criminality has decreased. In addition, not even the entire population was armed, but only some volunteer units were formed.
NEWS: ""Since May, the level of criminality in Ukraine has increased, informs the press service of the Ministry of Interior [...] the rate of intentional homicides increased for half a year by over 9% (compared to 2021), and the number of thefts vehicles increased by 86% compared to the same period.
[...]
The Ukrainian authorities are to blame for offering automatic weapons to civilians without any control, many criminals quickly created organized crime groups and have been terrorizing the civilian population since the beginning of the hostilities.
[...] the official data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are underestimated. The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs prepared last week [also] a report to the Zelensky Administration regarding the increase in criminality in Ukraine. So, in the report, the increase in the number of crimes is 270%. Due to the lack of personnel and a large number of weapons provided to civilians, the number of serious crimes has increased in Ukraine, primarily - murders and robberies"".
NARRATIVE: The level of criminality in Ukraine increased three times following Kiev's decision to arm civilians.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The news about crime in Ukraine can also be found on the Ukraina.ru portal, which is part of the government media trust Russia Today. Russian journalists cite sources of the Resident Telegram channel, who claim that the president of Ukraine was informed by the Ukrainian interior minister that the level of crime in Ukraine has increased by 270%. In reality, the information presented by the Russian press does not coincide with the official information of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. There is no report at the level of the Government in Kiev that confirms that the level of criminality has increased so much.
According to the Security Service of Ukraine, the Rezident Telegram channel is coordinated by the Kremlin with the aim of misinforming the public opinion in Russia and destabilizing the situation in Ukrainian society. In 2021, several Russian agents were arrested participating in the distribution of information on this Telegram channel on the territory of Ukraine.
In fact, the official report of the Ministry of Interior of Ukraine, carried out by the Department of Criminal Investigation, shows that the level of criminality has decreased on the territory of Ukraine by 25% in the last 6 months. Moreover, there are fewer and fewer cases of theft and robbery, with the exception of the areas occupied by Russia or those in the conflict zone.
The reduction in the level of criminality on the territory of Ukraine has logical explanations. According to the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine, many Ukrainians (about 9 million) took refuge in other countries. Also, the decrease in the level of criminality is due to the traffic ban for citizens at night. The reduction in the number of the population and the contacts between the citizens remaining in Ukraine determined the decrease, and not the increase, in the level of criminality.
At the same time, according to the National Police, the 9% increase in the level of homicides on the territory of Ukraine was registered in the combat zones, and most of these cases refer to the crimes of the Russian military. The Ukrainian authorities add that weapons arrive as trophies from the battle zones to the territories near the front, which represents risks for the security of civilians.
The Russian government press manipulates public opinion, writing that every civilian has access to weapons. In reality, only the civilians enrolled in the territorial defense units, which in April were included in the general defense system of the Ukrainian state, are armed. The number of volunteers of the territorial defense units is known, there is a registry at the level of the Ukrainian government.
OBJECTIVE: The false narrative aims to demonstrate to the public opinion in Russia and in the Ukrainian territories occupied by the Russian military that Ukraine can no longer manage to maintain public order, cannot block organized crime groups, while in the areas controlled by Moscow the situation is under control.

The narrative was launched after Romanian soldiers killed in the Second World War were commemorated in a town in the Republic of Moldova.
NEWS: Let's imagine for a second that Nazism would have been defeated in the Second World War. Hitler would have been everything for us, and communism and the Jews - the world evil, and the Romanians in Moldova, excuse me, in Bessarabia would have been the lords, the ""superior race"" and masters. The maximum that our current political class could hope for would be he had attended two or three classes in the church school, so that he could sign, write denunciations and count the cows. Why would the ""herd"" who had to take care of the cows and rams need quality education? In order to stand at the tail of the cow, it is enough to count to 100 and to be able to read the orders of the ""gentlemen"". And we would have had no schools, no universities, no Academy of Sciences. NARRATIVE: If the Republic of Moldova had been part of Romania, it would have been an underdeveloped region, with an illiterate population enslaved by Romanians.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the Republic of Moldova, several cemeteries or monuments dedicated to Romanian soldiers who fought in the Second World War were rehabilitated or built, actions that were criticized by some politicians or the Russian media and/or pro - the Russian, who qualifies them as signs of a revival of fascism. Criticism was accompanied by the resumption of narratives first used by Soviet propaganda.
In Soviet historiography, literature and cinematography, the Romanian soldiers who fought in the Second World War were presented as fascists who destroyed the local population, this narrative being a continuation of a similar one that appeared immediately after 1918 about the ""Romanian gendarme"" who beat the Bessarabians after the union of Bessarabia with Romania. Similarly, the period between 1918-1940, after the union of Bessarabia with Romania, is considered by the respective sources as an occupation, in accordance with the theses of Moldovanism regarding the existence of two different languages ​​and peoples.
OBJECTIVE: To bring back to the collective memory the associations promoted during the Soviet period between Romania/Romanians and fascism and to praise the Soviet period.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The union of Bessarabia with Romania was first decided in Chisinau, being voted by the Council of the Country, in the context in which, against the background of the collapse of the Tsarist Empire and the civil war, the territory between the Prut and the Dniester was in danger, so it was not a matter of a ""Romanian occupation"". It should be noted that the respective territory had not voluntarily united with the Tsarist Empire, which had captured it during its expansion to the west. In the Tsarist Empire, Bessarabia was treated as a remote, underdeveloped governorate, with the local (Romanian) population concentrated in the rural area. The phenomenon did not disappear after Bessarabia was captured by the USSR, when the Romanian population was the target of large-scale persecution (mass deportations, arrests, executions). Both during the Tsarist period and and in the Soviet one, the elites of the province were at best Russified, when they were not directly brought in. Moreover, the territory that had represented Bessarabia in the SSR was kept as a predominantly agricultural area, industrial development being reserved for Transnistria. Considering all these arguments, it can be said that underdevelopment is a phenomenon associated rather with the Tsarist and Soviet occupation.
After the collapse of the USSR, Romania became the country that invested the most in the education of young people in the Republic of Moldova. Annually, it offers places in its universities and high schools for young people from the Republic of Moldova, offering them larger scholarships than those in the Republic of Moldova. As part of a grant agreement offered to the Republic of Moldova, Romania repaired over 900 kindergartens and invested in the repair and expansion of the ""Mihai Eminescu"" High School in Comrat, the capital of the Gagauz Autonomous Region, a Russophile region.
In order to have an indication of what the level of development of the territory between the Prut and Dniester would have been if it had continued from Romania, we can look at its degree of development. Romania's GDP per capita, for example, is more than twice that of the Republic of Moldova and has also surpassed that of the Russian Federation.
It should be noted, however, that such exercises of alternative history are futile, being used in this case for strictly propagandistic purposes.
TRUTH: Romania was, indeed, allied with Nazi Germany during the war fought by it with the Soviet Union, which broke out almost two years after the two totalitarian states had started the Second World War by attacking Poland. Throughout the years in which it was allied with Germany, before turning its weapons against it, Romania had a leadership that adopted policies and a speech similar to that of Berlin, both in terms of the position towards communism, and and the one against the Jews; moreover, through the gendarmerie, the army and its administration, the Romanian state participated in the Holocaust. Communists and Jews from Bessarabia were victims of the Romanian state. Publication / Media:

In reality, the authorities in Kherson were evacuated following the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian army, which bombards the Ukrainian territory daily.
NEWS: ""After forming a people's government, the Kherson region will become a worthy part of Russia, said the deputy head of the military-civilian administration of the region, Kirill Stremousov, at a meeting with the residents of the liberated village of Vinogradovo, but he specified that the last the population has a say.
""I sincerely believe that we will be able to rebuild and move to another level of living, which I can see now in the Russian Federation"", he emphasized in a video posted on his Telegram channel"", writes the Russian publication Life. ru, emphasizing the successes of the separatist authorities recorded in recent months.
""The Ukrainian language will remain. It must be the state language on the territory of the Kherson region. No one will ban the language,"" said Stremousov.
[...]
""Our goal is to preserve Ukrainian culture. It is not a genocide, it is not a destruction. It's denazification,"" explained the president of the Rescue Committee for Peace and Order. Stremousov recalled that after the former authorities fled, the military-civilian administration was forced from the first days of the special military operation to assume responsibility for the fate of the region."" , according to an article published by Fedpress.ru.
NARRATIVES: 1. The population of Kherson wants union with Russia. 2. The Ukrainian authorities fled Kherson. 3. The Ukrainian language and culture are protected by the separatist leaders and Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Kirill Stremousov is not the representative of the Kherson regional authorities, but a collaborator of the Russians, named deputy head of the military-civilian administration, which is an occupation body. He does not have the legitimacy or the legal right to speak about the opinions of the majority of the inhabitants of the region and especially about the union of the region of southern Ukraine with Russia. The results of the local elections in 2020 also tell us about Kirill Stremousov's lack of legitimacy. He wanted to become mayor of the city of Kherson and got only 1.37% of votes. He was a member of pro-Russian parties. After the invasion of Ukraine, with the support of the Kremlin, he established a ""Rescue Committee"", which, apparently, helps the Russian speakers in the area.
According to a survey conducted by the National Democratic Institute and the Institute of Sociology in Kyiv, 89% of Ukrainians do not accept territorial cessions in the name of peace. Most polls conducted in southern Ukraine before the invasion showed that Ukrainians there have a critical attitude towards Russia, which supported the war in Donbass and annexed Crimea in 2014. Images from the first days of the Russian occupation of southern Ukraine showed that the local population protested against the invasion, trying to stop the Russian tanks.
According to sociological surveys, conducted in March 2022 in the territories controlled by Ukraine, 9 out of 10 Ukrainians in the south of the country consider Russia an enemy. Also, the Ukrainians in the south of the country believe in the victory of Ukraine in the war started by Moscow.
The thesis, according to which the Ukrainian authorities fled from Kherson, is also false. They were evacuated following military pressure from Russia, which Stremousov himself confirms, talking about the ""special military operation"". The Regional State Administration in Kherson announced in March that they were evacuating to another locality due to the constant bombardment and battles in the city, and on the official Facebook page of the local authorities there are announcements about the situation in the region, about the liberated villages and the safe ways to evacuate the population.
Stremousov's statements, quoted by the Russian press, about the interest in protecting the Ukrainian language and culture, but continuing ""denazification"" are nonsense. ""Denazification"" is seen by Russia as a process of destroying Ukrainian national-cultural elements, considered a barrier to restoring the influence of the ""Russian world"" on Ukraine. In reality, Ukrainians are persecuted by the separatist authorities in Luhansk, Donetsk and Kherson for using the Ukrainian language. According to some journalistic investigations, people who do not speak Russian do not pass the procedures of verification at the filtering centers in the occupied Ukrainian territories.
In the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, all publications that appeared in the Ukrainian language were closed and there are no schools teaching in the Ukrainian language. The subject of human rights in the Crimean peninsula has been addressed several times at the level of the competent UN institutions. The UN resolutions included various requests to Russia to ensure the rights of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars. The example of Crimea shows that the Russian Federation initiates the Russification of the occupied territories, and has no policies to respect the rights of linguistic minorities.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives regarding the regions of southern Ukraine, occupied by Russia. In June-July a.c. the Russian press wrote that Romania will help Ukraine recover Kherson. In May, the Russian government press wrote that Crimean Tatars support Russia's military actions on the territory of Ukraine, and in April - that the south of Ukraine, liberated by nationalists, wants to be annexed to Russia.

In reality, the Istanbul agreements do not include such provisions, and Moscow violated them by bombing the port of Odessa.
NEWS: ""The international community has recognized Russia's right to control Ukraine's seaports - this is the political meaning of the Istanbul agreements, which aim to ensure the continuous export of Ukrainian agricultural production.""
[...]
Ukrainian media expert Anatolii Sarii called the agreements in Istanbul ""terrifying for Kiev"". ""It is a clear victory for Russia... Everyone bowed their heads, including the UN"", he declared on his blog.
[...]
Both the Turkish authorities and the UN leadership directly recognized Russia's right to decide the fate of the next maritime transport that will be sent from Ukraine. For the first time at the international level, despite the style of activity based on ""political correctness"" instilled by the elites in the West, Russia's right to act as it has actually been acting since February last year was recognized.
[...]
We can only hope that now in the Western states people will start coming to power who are able to stop supporting the national populists from Kiev and start solving together with Russia and China the accumulated problems"".
NARRATIVE: The UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control Ukraine's seaports.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The agreements signed in Istanbul do not mention any takeover of control over Ukrainian ports and maritime communications by Russia. These agreements were signed on July 22 by the representatives of Russia and Ukraine, with the Turkish president and the UN secretary general acting as intermediaries.
It is about 2 different agreements: one refers to the unblocking of Russian agricultural exports and the other - to the unblocking of Ukrainian agricultural exports.
Ukraine has complained in front of international forums that Russia is blocking its ports, being forced to close them due to permanent bombings. Until the invasion, 80-90% of Ukrainian grain exports were carried out through sea ports. Less than 24 hours after the signing in Istanbul of the agreement that would allow, according to estimates, the export of 20 million tons of Ukrainian grain, Moscow sent cruise missiles on the grain installations in the port of Odesa.
President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of not fulfilling its commitments under the agreements, stating that grain exports depend only on Moscow and the cessation of the bombing by the Russian army of Ukrainian ports. The representative of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andrij Sybiha, accused Russia of violating the agreements, which prohibit the bombing of ports.
Instead, the Russian press quotes the expert Anatolii Sarii, who fled from Ukraine until the invasion of February 24 BC. and who is accused by the SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) of distributing Russian propaganda and collaborating with the Kremlin. Over the last few years, Sarii's blog has become quite popular in Ukraine, and his party has created groups in various local councils. Anatolii Sarii is accused of treason. The Russian press continues to present him as an independent Ukrainian expert. He called the Istanbul agreements ""terrifying for Kiev"" and emphasized that the UN and Turkey recognize Russia's right to control the Black Sea, but they do not show where in the signed documents it is said about this.
In fact, any unilateral control of a state over the ports or communications of another state cannot be decided by any international organization, including the UN. Ukraine has the right to control its territorial waters and seaports. Russia's occupation of some Ukrainian territories does not mean the emergence of its right to control seaports, given that military aggression is not considered a method of legitimizing territorial control.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of Russia that aim to convince public opinion that states and international organizations recognize its right to occupy various territories of Ukraine. In June, the Russian press wrote that the Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace. Also, in April, the Russian government press wrote that Vladimir Putin convinced the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, that the Ukrainian Nazis should be tried at the International Criminal Court. The Russian press also tried to convince the public opinion that the UN supports the genocide directed against the Russian speakers in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

Like other Russian publications, topwar.ru incorrectly quoted statements made in Bucharest by President Maia Sandu and interpreted them as announcing an alliance against Russia.
NEWS: The President of the Republic of Moldova declared that the situation related to the security of the country is very tense, and Chisinau relies on the support of its ""partners"" if it gets worse. It is interesting who Maia Sandu considers to be the main partner of Moldova. Considering that she owns Romanian passport, it is not difficult to guess that she considers Romania the main partner.
[...]
Sandu: We are preparing for any possible scenario. In the event that Russia tries to attack Moldova, it is clear that we will ask for help. We will ask Romania.
[...]
These statements justify the discussions that this is a kind of invitation from Moldova for a possible deployment of the Romanian army in the Republic of Moldova and its absorption by the Romanian state"", writes topwar.ru.
""Sandu declares war on Russia"", captioned anna-news.info, on the same topic. And rusevik.ru wrote that ""Maia Sandu is trying to scare Russia with Romania"" and vesti.ua reported that ""Moldova has already requested support"" from Romania to defend itself from Russia"" NARRATIVES: 1. The Republic of Moldova is ready to ally with a NATO state against Russia. 2. Chisinau and Bucharest are preparing the annexation of the Republic of Moldova by Romania.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: With a poorly equipped army, with a pro-Russian secessionist region, where a Russian military contingent is also stationed, the small state of the Republic of Moldova is the most vulnerable in the event of the expansion of the war in Ukraine. The Chisinau authorities have stated several times that they are talking with external partners in order to support the increase of military and security resilience. These declarations are interpreted in Moscow as a violation of the country's neutrality status and alliance with NATO states, Russia's rivals.
On July 29, Maia Sandu visited Bucharest where, during a joint press conference with Klaus Iohannis, she reiterated the vulnerabilities her country is facing. Being asked by journalists what support the Republic of Moldova expects from Romania in case the war in Ukraine expands, Maia Sandu declared that the Chisinau authorities will request help, but did not specify from whom.
""We are worried and accept all scenarios, including the most pessimistic ones, respectively we are preparing for all scenarios, and in the event that Russia tries to attack the Republic of Moldova, we will obviously ask for help"", she declared.
OBJECTIVE: To present the Republic of Moldova as a state hostile to Russia, which is ready to ally against it with the NATO states. To inoculate the idea that any support from Romania will end with the annexation of the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Republic of Moldova is directly adjacent to Romania (the only EU state with which it has a border) and it is expected that, in case it is attacked by Russia, it will rely on the support of Bucharest, especially as among the two countries have a special relationship and a common language and culture. Maia Sandu did not explicitly state that the Republic of Moldova will request help from Romania; the leader from Chisinau only said that the country should ask you for help.
On the other hand, it is unlikely that Romania will be willing to get involved in a possible conflict with the Russian Federation, a nuclear power that also has a conventional army that surpasses it in terms of personnel and equipment at its disposal Romanian army. Romania is indeed part of NATO, but it benefits from the Alliance's protection, through the activation of Article 5, only if it is the one attacked, not if it intervenes in any conflict. In addition, NATO has clearly shown that it wants to avoid a confrontation with the Russian Federation, so it is expected that it will strongly discourage any member from getting involved in such a confrontation. A similar opposition is expected from the European Union.
Most likely, if the Republic of Moldova is attacked, it can count on economic, humanitarian support and military equipment, just as Ukraine receives from the West at present, but not on a military intervention.
A military alliance between the Republic of Moldova and a NATO state would be hindered by the former's status of neutrality, a status supported by the majority of the population.
Regarding the ""absorption"" of the Republic of Moldova by Romania, there have never been official discussions regarding the union between the two countries, and from a political point of view this is impossible given that the majority of the population of the Republic of Moldova opposes it.

In reality, Russia is placing weapons and military equipment on the territory of the plant, endangering the nuclear security of Europe.
NEWS: ""The bombing of the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant by the Ukrainian military could cause a nuclear disaster. According to the deputy director of the Department of Information and Printing of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Ivan Neciaev, Kiev does this consciously.
He emphasized that the nuclear disaster of large proportions is in the interest of the USA and its allies. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine are bombarding with a maniacal insistence the largest nuclear power plant in Europe - Zaporozhye NPP, without thinking about the consequences, violating the resolution and decisions of the IAEA general conference"".
[...]
Previously, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia expressed its concern about the escalation by Kiev of the situation around the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. In the comment distributed by the ministry, it is said that the Russian Federation has been warning the Ukrainian authorities not to continue the provocations towards the nuclear power plant because an industrial disaster can be caused.
It is emphasized that Russia has a ""very responsible behavior towards the nuclear targets in Ukraine"" and is doing everything possible to ensure their security.
NARRATIVE: Kiev will cause a nuclear disaster in Zaporozhye at the behest of the US.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was occupied by the Russian military on March 4th. The Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly accused Russia of turning the plant into a ""military base"".
The Ukrainian company ""Energoatom"" communicated in July of this year that the Russian military brought at least 14 units of military equipment (missile launchers, tanks, armored cars, etc.) to the territory of the nuclear power plant. The nuclear objective is used as a shield for the Russian military, which they are aware of the fact that Ukraine will not risk shooting at the plant.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared on August 1 that the Russian troops are bombing the Ukrainian army from the positions near the nuclear power plant, confirming the information of the Ukrainian authorities. He qualified this ""tactic"" as ""the height of irresponsibility"". ""Of course, the Ukrainians cannot pull back without risking a terrible accident involving the nuclear power plant,"" Blinken told reporters after the end of the UN discussions on nuclear non-proliferation in New York.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly asked Russia not to carry out military actions near nuclear power plants. The Director of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, warned about the fact that the situation at the Zaporozhye plant in Ukraine, which is under Russian control, is increasingly dangerous and insisted that it is necessary to allow access to the agency's experts in order to avoid a tragedy.
According to the State Inspection for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine, the IAEA mission cannot visit the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant for security reasons. ""As long as the plant is occupied by Russia - we cannot ensure the security of the members of the mission"", according to the Ukrainian authorities.
In July, the deputy director of the State Agency for the Management of the Exclusion Zone in Ukraine, Maksim Sevciuk, asked the IAEA to put more pressure on Russia to leave the plant. He stated that the plant's six reactors have a lot of nuclear fuel. Also, large amounts of nuclear waste are accumulating.
The Ukrainian army published a video footage from the drone that shows that the Russian positions on the territory of the nuclear power plant were not bombed. Ukrainian officials claim that they cannot afford to bomb a nuclear power plant because the risks are too great.
EU Foreign Ministers discussed in mid-July a possible tightening of sanctions against Russia for deploying missile launchers at the nuclear power plant. While the international community warns Russia about the danger of a nuclear disaster, the Russian press, without presenting any evidence, accuses Kiev and the US of wanting this.
In 2016, the UN adopted a resolution, voted by the USA, the EU member states, etc., according to which the international community undertakes never to repeat the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which took place on the territory of Ukraine on April 26, 1986. Any nuclear disaster will brings damage to the whole world, and not just to a particular state, according to the resolution. Publication / Media:

The false narrative appears in an online publication close to the Kremlin, and the goal is to excuse the totalitarian Soviet regime, which imposed itself through terror.
NEWS: The RuBaltic.Ru portal writes that ""the key events that constitute anti-Soviet propaganda in the Republic of Moldova are the famine of 1946-47 and the deportations of 1949. A system of lies was built around these events, which collapses when confronted with evidence historical. A deeper look at the post-war events in the Moldovan SSR clearly shows that the conclusions reached by the ""pro-Western"" researchers about the famine in Moldova are beyond any criticism. The Soviet Union did not organize the ""genocide of the Moldovans"" - the famine after the war in the Moldavian SSR it had a mass character precisely because it was not reported to Moscow in time by Chisinau, and the help came from the Union Center too late"".
The publication writes that the main cause of the famine was the drought of 1946 and the precarious situation in the republic caused by war and occupation; besides this, the state plans for the delivery of wheat had to be fulfilled, which worsened the critical situation in the Moldoveneasca SSR. The publication writes that in this context, the Union government decided to reduce the wheat delivery plans and that aids and loans for wheat and seed material were granted. The additional aid requested by the Moldovan leadership in the letter addressed to Stalin on December 21, 1946 was delayed by a month and a half, which constitutes the second human, subjective factor that negatively influenced the situation. The Union Government decided to ""grant additional aid to collective farms, state farms and peasant households in the Moldavian SSR [to compensate for] the lack of harvest in 1946"". The Soviet government sent him to Moldova as the deputy secretary of the Soviet of Ministers of the USSR, A.N. Kosighin. In the opinion to Kosighin, the mistake of the leadership of the republic consisted in the fact that it, out of fear or because of the generally complicated situation in the country, did not inform the Union governing bodies on time and in full about the situation in Moldova. ""The leadership of the USSR found out that the situation in Moldova is unfavorable not from the CC of the PCM, but from the reports of the prosecutor's office and other departments,"" the publication writes.
""Currently, many pro-Western researchers are trying to present the events as a genocide of the Moldovan people by the Union leadership. An objective look at the historical facts, however, shows that they do not correspond to these tendentious ""researchers"". These ""researchers"" have an exclusively propagandistic character and aim to rewrite the true history of Moldova"", concludes RuBaltic.Ru. NARRATIVES: 1. The famine was not organized by the Soviet regime, and Moscow helped Moldova during the famine. 2. Famine and deportations do not represent Bolshevik terror, but false anti-Soviet propaganda. 3. The famine of 1947 is a consequence of the inaction of the local authorities, it was not organized by the central leadership of the USSR. 4. The researches of pro-Western historians from the Republic of Moldova are tendentious and aim to rewrite its true history.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to excuse the totalitarian communist regime from the crimes it committed and to distort the historical truth that came to the surface with the collapse of the USSR and the independence of the former Soviet republics.
CONTEXT: The current territory of the Republic of Moldova was part of the USSR, being occupied on June 28, 1940 following the secret agreement between Stalin and Hitler from 1939, the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. The Bolshevik Soviet regime was a totalitarian one and imposed itself in the occupied territories through terror methods: people who were inconvenient to the regime were imprisoned, summarily executed, sent to the gulag, deported. Throughout Soviet history, millions of people were victims of political repression, which was an instrument of the internal policy of the USSR leadership, culminating in the Stalin era. One of the manifestations of this terror was the organized hunger, not only in Moldova, but also in the entire USSR. For example, the organized Russian famine of 1921 caused the death of over five million people, four million Ukrainians and two million other nationalities died during the famine of 1932-1933, and hundreds of thousands died in during the famine in the SSR, from 1946-1947.
These topics were taboo during the Soviet period. The topic of organized hunger was one of the most secret episodes in the history of the USSR.
Starting this year, the victims of the organized famine of 1946-1947 are commemorated on the third Saturday of April. The decision was voted in Parliament by the PAS deputies, while the MPs from the socialist-communist group and those from the Sor Party left the meeting hall.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The communist regime showed right from the beginning of the occupation of the RSSM that terror is the fastest and most effective method for inoculating the new order. In addition to the arrests, deportations, assassinations carried out by the Soviet power against the population, according to historians, the organized famine killed between 150 and 350 thousand people in the SSR, being affected by hunger and disease a third of the population of the Republic. At the same time, the famine of 1946-1947 forced the peasants to accept collectivization.
The taxation of the peasants by the Soviet regime started as early as 1944, immediately after the reoccupation of Bessarabia, reports Mariana Taranu, doctor in history. The General Staff increased taxes from year to year, the Soviet leadership demanded from each family a tax in products - eggs, wool, cheese, cereals for the Red Army - but also a sum of money. The state also demanded other products that people did not cultivate, being forced to buy them. The party bodies were focused on fulfilling the plan to collect agricultural products and requisitioned people's food reserves. The families that failed to pay these taxes had their property confiscated, and the heads of the families were judged by the Military Court and sentenced to forced labor. To fulfill the plan, the party activists were accompanied by armed soldiers who literally swept the bridges of the peasants of the last reserves. These taxes made life in the rural area even more difficult. The Soviet leadership used the climatic conditions to camouflage the policy of starving the population. Given that in 1946, 365 thousand tons of grain were harvested, half of the population's needs, and the requisition plan in Bessarabia was 255 thousand tons, famine was imminent, says historian Anatol Taranu.
The famine could have been avoided, says historian Ion Siscanu: ""The mass mortality from starvation was not the result of the drought, but of the economic and social policy of the totalitarian communist regime towards the population of the Moldavian SSR, of the Soviet system of access to food products . The main responsibility for the death of hundreds of thousands of people of the Moldavian SSR belongs to the Moscow leadership and the Bolshevik Communist Party, the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party for the Moldavian SSR. Along with Stalin and the leadership from the Kremlin, guilty of starvation mortality are: the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Moldova and the first secretary Sologor, the council of ministers and its president Nicolai Coval, the representative of Moscow for grain collection, Sici and other dignitaries who decided the fate of Soviet citizens"".
The famine in the SSR was a crime against humanity, which must be condemned at the international level, claims historian Lidia Padureac: ""There is enough evidence that indicates from an international legal point of view that the famine in the Moldavian SSR from 1946-1947 is a crime against humanity. The large number of victims, the persecution of people are arguments that impose the necessity of officially condemning the Soviet occupation regime on the territories between the Dniester and the Prut and the declaration at national and international level of the famine caused by the Soviet-communist officials of the Moldavian SSR in the years 46-47 as a crime against humanity"".
The very fact that the Soviet leadership forbade any mention of the famine in the USSR denotes the regime's complicity in organizing the famine.
The commission for the study and assessment of the totalitarian communist regime in the Republic of Moldova found that the regime was, from the beginning until the last moment, a criminal and repressive one, which committed acts of genocide and crimes against humanity through mass terror, political repression , organized hunger, deportations, violation of human dignity and fundamental human rights.
NUTS OF TRUTH: It is true that the famine of 1947 was preceded by a terrible drought on a large part of the territory of the USSR, but periodic droughts affect the territory of Moldova and have never led to such humanitarian crises. Being in a dry area, the Moldavian peasants accumulated the experience of surviving in such calamities, they knew how to make food and sowing reserves for such cases, they limited their consumption, and the wealthy helped the poor to survive. However, the fiscal policies of the Soviet state forcibly deprived the peasants of food and reserves.
Indeed, the representatives from Moscow noticed the proportions of this catastrophe in the SSR. After Kosighin's inspection visit, he reported that the level of mortality, illness and food dystrophy caused by hunger is very high. The decisions to help, however, came too late, when hunger caused too many victims, they were insufficient and did not reduce mortality. Publication / Media:

According to the propaganda narrative, the missile launched by the Russian forces would have hit the Officers' House in the center of the city of Vinita while the generals were discussing a counter-offensive in Donbass. In reality, as a result of the rocket attack, 23 civilians were killed, including children. A charity concert was supposed to take place in the Officers' House, which is not a military objective.
NEWS: ""Under the ruins of the Officers' House in Vinita after the Russian missile strike, there are not only representatives of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, who were discussing new arms deliveries from the EU. The meeting of the leadership of the Armed Forces was devoted to the most serious problem of Ukraine - the catastrophic shortage of fighter planes.
[...]
After the failure in the USA, the Ukrainian military and diplomats returned to the old discussion about the transport of Soviet MIGs from Poland. The details of this operation were discussed at the meeting of the senior officers of the Air Force and the Main Intelligence Directorate in the center of Vinita. The meeting was interrupted forever by the ""Kalibr"" missile strike, following the distribution of fake news by Ukrainian propaganda about the bombing of a multi-block neighborhood and an ""innocent"" building.
The details of this high-precision strike in Vinita were described by the journalist Roman Golovanov during a discussion with the military expert of the ""Komsomolska Pravda"" newspaper, Viktor Baranet, who specified that the Russian military managed to kill the leadership of the Air Force with one blow of Ukraine"".
[...]
As they are preparing for a counter-offensive in Donbass, they were discussing air coverage of this region.
[...]
According to the testimony of an inferior officer from the support group who survived, the missile hit the presidium of the improvised military meeting, destroying at least 15 generals.
NARRATIVE: Russia killed at least 15 Ukrainian generals in Vinita with a single missile, stopping the counteroffensive in Donbass.
CONTEXT: Three Russian rockets hit a commercial building in the center of Vinita city, located near the Officers' House, with offices and representatives of small businesses, as well as the surrounding parking lot. More than 55 surrounding buildings were damaged as a result of the attack. At least 23 people were killed, including three children. The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the Vinita attack demonstrated once again that Russia must be recognized as a ""terrorist state"". ""No other state in the world represents such a terrorist threat as Russia. No other state in the world has allows to destroy peaceful cities and people with cruise missiles and artillery every day,"" Zelenskiy said. At the same time, the Armed Forces of Russia claim that they hit only one military objective.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Officers' House in Vinita is not a military objective, but a cultural one. On July 14, a charity concert was supposed to take place there, with the participation of the singer Roxolana. The event was announced long before on Ukrainian websites. The Officers' House in Vinita was a real cultural center, archipelago on weekends, with many children participating in various workshops and other activities.
Russia did not launch a single missile at Vinita, but several. According to Ukrainian media, the regional military center in Vinita is located a few kilometers from the Officers' House, and no meetings or meetings of the leadership of the Ukrainian Armed Forces took place in the locality, taking into account the proximity to the separatist region of Transnistria, seen as a threat.
The Russian government press did not provide any evidence about the missile that would have exactly hit the presidium of a meeting, attended by 15 Ukrainian generals. Viktor Baranet is quoted, who says that thanks to this attack, the deliveries of fighter planes from Poland were stopped and the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Donbass was stopped. In other words, the bombing of Vinita is presented as an achievement, as an attempt to ""save"" the residents of eastern and southern Ukraine from Kiev's counteroffensive. Baranet is not, however, an independent expert and does not provide proven information. On the website the publication ""Komsomolska pravda"" with which Baranet collaborates, the biography of the military expert is published. From there we learn that Viktor Baranet is a Russian officer in the reserve, he obtained many medals for ""Soviet heroism"", and in 2020 he became an emeritus journalist of Russia, a title conferred by the government. In other words, Baranet has the role of dressing in clothes journalistic and expert propaganda narratives of the Kremlin and to present them in a ""truthful"" style to the Russian-language media in the former Soviet states.
Veridica dismantled a series of propaganda narratives, which justified the killing of civilians by the Russian military on the territory of Ukraine. The Russian press wrote in April that the massacre in Bucea was an invention of ""Ukrainian propaganda"", and in May - that the Ukrainian army was bringing corpses to Lisiansk to stage a new massacre. In the first stages of the invasion, the Russian press argued that the Ukrainian military they destroyed the city of Mariupol, and Russia only attacked the buildings in the east of the country where American biological weapons laboratories were operating.

Earlier, Sputnik radio reported that a decree was signed in Zaporizhia on the establishment of a commission that will organize a referendum"".
NARRATIVE: Zaporozhye has established international contacts with at least 15 countries, including EU members.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there are no contacts or international relations between the Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia and the Western states. The international community condemned the annexation of Crimea in 2014, did not recognize the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine and has no intention of changing its position vis-à-vis other territories occupied by Russia in the large-scale invasion launched on February 24.
The EU has repeatedly asked Russia to stop military actions on the territory of Ukraine, to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine based on internationally recognized borders, and the EU member states have done the same. At the level of foreign ministers and state leaders, 7 packages of sanctions against Russia were discussed and introduced as a response to the unprovoked military actions in Ukraine. Therefore, the persons responsible for the foreign policies of the European states criticized Russia, initiated the deepening of sanctions, requested the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine, and there can be no question of international contacts with the separatist or occupation administrations.
In fact, the Zaporizhia region, partially occupied by Russian forces, is coordinated by the Regional State Administration, which is a legitimate body of the power in Kiev. Vladimir Rogov, mentioned by the Russian media as a ""member of the main council of the administration of the Zaporizhia region"" is a representative of the Russian bodies in the occupied area of ​​the region. Rogov fled to Russia in 2014, after speaking out against Euromaidan, he supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass, and in 2022 he was brought by Russia as a representative of Moscow in the Zaporizhia region. He was prosecuted for collaboration with Russia.
On July 20, the EU introduced sanctions against Vladimir Rogov for supporting or carrying out ""actions that undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, the stability or security of Ukraine"", according to the document. The inclusion of Rogov on the sanctions lists, coordinated by all EU member states is by no means an act establishing ""international contacts"" with it.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Veridica has debunked a series of false narratives regarding the situation in the Zaporozhye region. In April, the Russian press wrote that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporizhia are requesting to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. In May, Vladimir Rogov, quoted by Russian government press agencies, said that Ukraine is preparing to cede the city of Zaporozhye, and in June the Russian press wrote that volunteers from Zaporozhye are joining a battalion that will defend the region from the aggression of the Ukrainian army .
On July 20 a.c. the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov declared that Moscow is expanding its ""special operation"" in Ukraine to the southern regions: Kherson, Zaporozhye and others. In this context, the false narrative aims to justify military actions in Ukraine and to prepare public opinion from the former Soviet states for extending the war to other Ukrainian regions.

It was signed in 1992 by the presidents of Russia and the Republic of Moldova, B. Eltin and M. Snegur. Then Russian peacekeepers were brought to the region who are a guarantor of peace in Transnistria until today. However, the current rulers of the Republic of Moldova declare more and more often about ""the need to evacuate the Russian peacekeepers from Transnistria"".
[...] ,,The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Moldavian Dniester Republic mentioned in an interview for RIA Novosti that if Chisinau decides to denounce the 1992 Agreement, war may break out in the region. According to Vitali Ignatiev, such a decision by the Moldovan authorities can be the prologue of an armed conflict"" NARRATIVES: 1. Chisinau intends to denounce the 1992 ceasefire agreement, which will lead to a new military conflict. 2. Chisinau wants to destroy the pacification mission on the Dniester.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On March 2, 1992, the armed conflict broke out on the Dniester between the constitutional forces controlled by Chisinau and the separatist forces from Tiraspol, supported by Moscow. Troops of the Russian XIV Army, stationed on the left side of the Dniester during the Soviet period, were also involved in the conflict. The armed phase of the conflict ended after the signing of a peace agreement by the then presidents of the Republic of Moldova and Russia, Mircea Snegur and Boris Eltin. The agreement stipulated, among other things, the establishment of a demilitarized zone along the Dniester, known as the Security Zone, and the formation of a mission of peacekeepers from the Russian military, the Republic of Moldova and separatist regions.
Many experts and politicians subsequently criticized the Agreement on the principles of peaceful settlement of the armed conflict in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, dated July 21, 1992.
They considered it as a capitulation of Chisinau, including because the Republic of Moldova and Transnistria are put on an equal footing as belligerent parties. At the same time, it was noted that the signing of the document by Russia is proof of its involvement in the war on the Dniester.
The so-called foreign minister from Tiraspol, Vitali Ignatiev, gave two extensive interviews on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Agreement. In the one granted to Sputink Moldova, Ignatiev says that in a referendum (not recognized by the international community) in 2006, the majority of the population in the region opted for independence with the subsequent possibility of joining the Russian Federation.
In the interview for RIA Novosti, Ignatiev talks about a possible denunciation by Chisinau of the Agreement and the consequences of such an act.
At the same time, the Russian deputy Dmitri Belik declared that Transnistria's desire to join Russia should be examined ""seriously"" and that it should be seen as an event ""in the near future"".
The tensions related to the Transnistrian separatist region, located between the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, increased with the Russian invasion. More than once, Russian officials, including Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, have spoken about Russia's intention to reach this region.
OBJECTIVE: To inoculate the idea that the Chisinau authorities would intend to denounce the ceasefire agreement, thus justifying a possible Russian military intervention ""to ensure peace in the region and defend Russian citizens in the region""
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Chisinau has never expressed its intention and has never even discussed the possibility of denouncing the 1992 agreement, even if some of its provisions, such as ensuring free movement, are not respected.
The denunciation of Chisinau's requests regarding the evacuation of the Russian peacekeepers has already become part of the propaganda from the Kremlin and Tiraspol. In fact, the Republic of Moldova demands the evacuation of the Russian military and the ammunition left over from the Soviet era. It's about different things. And Russia undertook at the OSCE summit in Istanbul in 1999 to withdraw troops and military ammunition by the end of 2001, something that has not happened even to this day. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""Besides the fact that we are among the very few countries in the world that have allocated 2% of GDP for Defense, i.e. for the purchase of weapons from the USA, following that, since the year, that we still have such intimate interpersonal relations, to allocate 2.5% of GDP, the strategic partnership with the USA (which other countries also have) did not bring us anything good.
To brag about the shield from Deveselu, which did nothing but damage our economic relations with the Russians, before the conflict with Ukraine, and the base from Kogalniceanu, where we maintain about 2,000 American soldiers which does not scare anyone, is at least embarrassing. The only polite thing that the Americans could do, as we were still paying heavy bills to their arms industry, would have been to lift our entry visas to the USA. Anyway, as they also have information, they wouldn't have sent the Romanians across the ocean, because ours are smart guys and they know what the standard of living is like there, the real one, not the one in the stories. But this partnership is so strategic, that the USA gave us a shot. Every time [...] Now, however, at the time of the anniversary, President Klaus Iohannis tells us, in a roundabout way, to say goodbye to visas, because we don't need them anyway"". NARRATIVES: 1. Romania is an American colony that the USA exploits through the sale of arms 2. The USA has not invested anything in Romania 3. Romania will never enter the VISA Waiver program
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On July 11, it was 25 years since the launch of a strategic partnership in Romania and the USA, a fact that paved the way for Romania to join NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.
These objectives constituted the two national objectives of Romania, after the Revolution of 1989 and then after the Snagov Pact of 1995, to which all Romanian parties adhered, regardless of their ideological beliefs.
The signing of the strategic partnership with the USA in 1997 came after missing the chance to become members of the North Atlantic Alliance, after the NATO Summit in Madrid, an event that took place on July 8-9, 1997. At that event, Hungary, Poland and Czechia. OBJECTIVE: Amplification and cultivation of anti-American and anti-Western sentiments among public opinion in Romania.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The theme of Romania presented as a colony of the West is one of the main narratives of Russian propaganda present in the Romanian media space.
The Veridica portal has repeatedly written about how this main narrative of the Kremlin's propaganda is then tailored and customized for Romania in order to arouse anti-Western, especially anti-American and Eurosceptic feelings.
After the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russian propaganda focused especially on the military dimension of Romania's relationship with the West. Whether it was false narratives according to which Romania will be left a prey to the war against Russia, or that Romania should not arm itself in order not to disturb Russia, or that Romania is obliged to buy armaments from the USA, a country that would take advantage of due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
In reality, Romania is nowhere near one of the big clients of the American manufacturers, who sold about 54 billion dollars worth of armaments in the last five years. Romania is in the process of acquiring 54 HIMARS missile launchers, and the contract also provides for the purchase of 81 M31A1 Unitary missiles and 81 M30A1 Alternative warhead missiles, as well as 54 ATACMS missiles, which have an effective range of action up to 300 km.
The estimated value of the contract is about 1.4 billion dollars, to which is also added the high-range surface-to-air missile system HSAM - PATRIOT worth about 100 million dollars.
Then, Romania will complete the contract for the purchase of F-16 aircraft with Portugal for which it paid 628 million dollars for 12 aircraft, a contract that has been running since 2013 and will buy five more to complete a fleet of 17 aircraft .
Also, Romania would buy 32 F-16 fighter jets from Norway for almost 350 million euros. Romania will also buy armaments from Switzerland, more precisely Piranha-type armored personnel carriers, worth about 868 million euros.
Therefore, arms purchases from the USA are not exclusive, but Romania also buys arms from other European countries. Moreover, 10 other NATO countries currently allocate at least 2% of GDP, so our country is not among the ""few"" in NATO in this regard.
Last but not least, Russia invaded Ukraine, a country that has 650 kilometers of direct border with Romania, and the increase to 2.5% of GDP for the military endowment is justified in these conditions of war and Russia's threats to NATO and Romania.
Regarding American investments in Romania, they are found not only in the military bases at Kogalniceanu, Deveselu or Campia Turzii, Romania being the second net beneficiary in the region with 363 million dollars invested by the USA, after Poland.
Also, the USA is in the top 5 foreign investors in Romania, according to the data of the National Bank of Romania, according to the balance of foreign direct investments depending on the country of origin of the final investor.
Thus, American investments in Romania accumulated a balance of 6.2 billion euros at the end of 2020, by no means in 13th place, as stated in the article on national.ro
Regarding the acceptance of Romania in the Visa Waiver program, there are certain conditions that must be fulfilled by each applying country regarding the refusal rate of temporary visas, which must not be higher than 3%.
 These refusal rates are still high, especially due to some mistakes made by Romanians when applying for visas for the USA, and the explanations have already been offered by the Romanian ambassador to the USA, Andrei Muraru.

In reality, McFaul presented several currents of opinion from the US and from around the world regarding the history of Ukraine, and not about the current Russian-Ukrainian war.
NEWS: ""McFaul stated that Putin's statements about the unity of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are supported by many scientists from the USA.
The former US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, said that many Americans, including scientists, support the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin about the historical unity of Russia and Ukraine. He announced this in an interview given to the online publication ""Ukrainska Pravda"" on July 14.
""There are many people in the US who share some of Putin's statements about Ukraine: ""Russians, Ukrainians, they are all the same, right? Their languages ​​are basically the same, right?"" he said.
[...]
The Russian leader repeatedly emphasized the importance of the Russian language for the peoples of the countries neighboring the Russian Federation. In the article ""On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians"", published in July 2021, Putin noted that the new leadership of Ukraine, which took power in Kiev after the 2014 coup, tried to erase everything that united them Ukrainians and Russians.
[...]
Putin called modern Ukraine entirely a creation of the Soviet era, consisting largely of historical Russian territories.""
NARRATIVE: American scholars support Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24, 2022, the Russian press is increasingly resorting to manipulating public opinion by intentionally misrepresenting press headlines. Most Russian publications and Telegram channels (News.ru, Gazeta.ru s.a.) wrote that the former American ambassador admitted for the first time that US scientists agree with Vladimir Putin's ideas regarding Ukraine.
At first reading, one gets the impression that American intellectuals support all actions, including military ones, of Russia on the territory of Ukraine. In the next paragraph of the text, it is specified that it is about the idea of ​​the unity of Russia and Ukraine, and it is only in the middle of the news that it is mentioned that it is, in fact, about history, and not about actuality! The unadvised reader is left with the idea that American scientists support Putin, unlike the political environment in Washington that supports Ukraine.
In another vein, the statement of the former American ambassador to Moscow was taken out of context and presented in a context favorable to Russian propaganda. Michael McFaul, in the interview given to the Ukrainian press, on the contrary, said that the historical truth is known in Washington, but he criticized some researchers from all over the world who are dominated by Soviet stereotypes: ""The Soviet Union has disappeared, but what I see it seems dangerous - Russian imperial narratives have not disappeared"".
The former diplomat mentioned that ""a program for the re-education of humanity on the topic of Ukrainian and Russian history must be developed, so that all myths are dispelled and people learn the true history of Ukraine"", said the diplomat. Not presenting these fragments from the interview with Michael McFaul, the Russian press totally distorted the content of the initial information.
Also, the Russian press mentioned a series of false narratives dismantled by Veridica during the last year: the 2014 coup d'état in Kiev, Ukraine - a false state created by the USSR, the Ukrainian language - an invented language.
On July 12, 2021, an article signed by Vladimir Putin was published on the Kremlin's website, entitled ""On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians"". The disinformation narratives that were disseminated after the publication of this article aligned with the political theses of the leader from the Kremlin. The article repeats the false narrative about Ukraine as a ""fake state"". For Putin, the Europeanized Ukraine is anti-Russia, which the Russian president wants to combat in his article. Vladimir Putin considers that Russians and Ukrainians are close from a historical point of view, and the Ukrainian state appeared following the initiatives of the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin.

NEWS: ""Romania has decided to extend temporary protection to family members and close relatives of stateless and foreigners from Ukraine, who can come to live in our country. Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, 4,353 citizens from Ukraine have obtained asylum in Romania and 33,865 have obtained residence permits. The data communicated by the General Inspectorate for Immigration deliberately omits the specification of the nationality of the citizens coming from Ukraine. If the General Inspectorate for Immigration were to publish the official data on the nationality of the beneficiaries of temporary protection from Ukraine, we would find with amazement that Romania has been filled with Africans and Asians. Although at the beginning it was allowed, at the urging of the European Union, only to receive stateless persons and foreigners who were in Ukraine on February 24, later they also accepted those who were in Ukraine before that date. But now it has gone to another level. Romania will also receive family members of stateless persons and foreigners from Ukraine, as well as their close relatives""
NARRATIVES: 1 Romania will be invaded by foreigners, especially refugees from Africa and Asia coming from Ukraine. 2 Romania is a far too tolerant country, and the authorities hide the problems that could be caused by immigrants.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHO: The intensification of fighting in Ukraine is constantly creating waves of refugees fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine on February 24, more than six million refugees have crossed from Ukraine to neighboring countries. Over a million Ukrainians passed through Romania and a little over 42,000 Ukrainian refugees remained in our country.
By attacking civilian targets in Ukraine, Russia pursues two goals. The first is to spread fear among civilians and to increase pressure on the Ukrainian authorities, and the second is to generate new waves of refugees in the hope of socio-economic destabilization in the EU, but especially in neighboring states close to Ukraine.
According to the latest UNCHR data, last month the EU hosted 3.3 million refugees from Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing xenophobic and racist attitudes related to the nationality, ethnicity or race of the refugees among the public opinion in Romania
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Romania is not one of the final destinations sought by Ukrainian refugees. Moreover, the small number of around 42,000 refugees who are currently in Romania attests to this. Comparatively, only in the Republic of Moldova, a considerably smaller state with much more limited possibilities, where there are currently over 70,000 Ukrainian refugees
According to statistical data of the Ministry of Interior, provided relatively recently to Free Europe, less than 10% of Ukrainian refugees were neither citizens of Ukraine nor of any EU country. Therefore, we are mostly talking about students from other countries of the world who studied in Ukraine before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Therefore, if we keep the proportion of about 10% of the 42,000 refugees now in Romania, we will not have more than about 4,000 people who do not have Ukrainian citizenship and who also took refuge in these waves in Romania. In conclusion, we cannot speak of an ""invasion"" in Romania and we do not even know if they are African or Asian, as stated in the title of the article on the national.ro portal.
Moreover, the narrative of immigrants who are a priori considered criminals who only bring problems to the host countries is often used by Russian propaganda.
Moreover, in the conditions in which Russia is blocking Ukraine's grain shipments by sea, Moscow is acting deliberately to starve African countries, the main customers for Ukrainian grains. One of Russia's goals is precisely to create new waves of African immigrants in Europe, after they have visibly decreased after the active phase of the war in Syria.
Also, Russia and Belarus keep the pressure on the EU by offering color to immigrants from all over the world to cross into Poland and put pressure on this country. Meanwhile, Poland has built a secure fence on the border with Belarus to stop this deliberate practice by Moscow and Minsk.
As far as Romania is concerned, as an EU member state, the authorities in Bucharest must implement Directive 2001/55/EC, which specifies that EU member states can offer temporary protection to ""all other stateless persons or nationals of third countries, other than Ukraine, with legal residence in Ukraine, who cannot return in safe and stable conditions to their country or region of origin"".
""All people fleeing Ukraine, regardless of the category they belong to, are received in the EU before their return to their place of origin"", explains the European Council on its official website, thus clarifying the rights and obligations of all refugees from Ukraine in EU member states.

The Polish publication Rzeczpospolita previously reported that Europe is forcing Ukrainian refugees to return home. Poland no longer grants monetary aid, forcing Ukrainians to return home. German citizens are dissatisfied with the aid provided to lazy Ukrainians"".
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian refugees from Germany will be accommodated in a former Nazi concentration camp
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: In reality, the photos of the buildings in the Sachsenhausen Memorial, on which banners were installed with the words ""Welcome to Germany"" in German, were faked. The Belarusian media published these photos, and the Russian media picked up the narrative. false, amplifying it. The administration of the Sachsenhausen Memorial denied this news, mentioning that it never intended to accommodate refugees from Ukraine on the territory of the former Nazi concentration camp. A museum is currently operating there.
The management of the museum wrote on Twitter that older photos were used to create this false narrative. ""We condemn the appearance of a series of fake news related to the history of Nazism with the aim of distributing brutal propaganda messages,"" according to the museum's post.
The memorial publishes on Twitter and an official comment for the German publication MOZ, in which it is said that the former concentration camp was used by the Russian media for the dissemination of fake news, and the management of the museum notified the German police about this case.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of propaganda narratives that aim to sow fears among Ukrainian refugees and mistrust towards them in the EU member states. In May, the Russian press wrote that the EU is afraid of tuberculosis originating from NATO laboratories in Ukraine and which was brought to European countries by Ukrainian refugees, and in June Russian propaganda announced that the EU would deport refugee men to Ukraine to be enlisted in the army. Ukrainian.
In order to strengthen readers' confidence in the false narratives about the absolutely negative attitude of EU citizens towards Ukrainians, the Russian press mentions a Polish newspaper that allegedly wrote about the ""hate of Europeans"" towards ""lazy Ukrainians"". In reality, the Russian press cites another propaganda narrative from June this year. The newspaper Rzeczpospolita wrote that the majority of Poles have a benevolent attitude towards Ukrainians, but some of them request conditioning of financial aid. Russian propaganda omitted the first part of the narrative, writing only about the Poles who want to see the Ukrainian refugees expelled from the country immediately. Publication / Media:

His statements were also picked up by the official press of the Russian Federation and aim to misinform and accuse the pro-European government in Chisinau of wanting to involve the country in the war.
NEWS: ""The former president of Moldova Igor Dodon admits that the government from Chisinau would ensure the transit of the weapons delivered to Ukraine on the territory of Moldova"", writes Ria Novosti. The publication takes the statements made by him in an interview with Publika TV.
""The current government participates in all anti-Russian sabbaticals, makes anti-Russian statements, bans everything Russian. They provide logistics for the supply of the Ukrainian army through Moldova. I'm sure it's not just fuel. Every day, hundreds of wagons in Ukraine. But it's not just fuel, people say they're running under cover. I do not rule out that there may also be weapons delivered to Ukraine. It's very dangerous, no one asked us, and Moldova becomes a direct participant in the military conflict"", declared former president Igor Dodon, in an interview for Publika TV. NARRATIVES: 1. Armament delivered to Ukraine transits the territory of Moldova; 2. The Republic of Moldova becomes a direct participant in the war in Ukraine; 3. The pro-European government in Chisinau has a Russophobic policy.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to accuse the pro-European government of implicating the country in the war. At the same time, the pro-Russian opposition from Chisinau is trying to destabilize the internal situation in the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT: The Russian invasion of Ukraine brought back to the fore the security risks for the Republic of Moldova, which had a war on its territory in 1992, and Russian military forces continue to be illegally on the left bank of the Dniester. The Chisinau authorities have officially condemned the Russian aggression in Ukraine and at the same time refer to the neutrality of the Republic of Moldova provided for in the Constitution. Against the backdrop of the Russian-Ukrainian war and major risks, the pro-European government of President Maia Sandu obtained the status of a candidate country for EU membership, along with Ukraine, in record time.
Former president Igor Dodon gave a first televised interview from house arrest. He is being investigated for committing several crimes, including corruption and treason. Igor Dodon is a politician known for his pro-Russian position. In the 2016 presidential campaign, he declared that the Crimean peninsula belonged to Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Igor Dodon's statements are false, the spokeswoman for the Government of the Republic of Moldova, Anastasia Taburecanu, told Veridica. ""Obviously, it's a fake. In order for the Republic of Moldova to respect its neutral status provided for in the Constitution, let's not get involved in any military conflict in any way. Respectively, no kind of weaponry is transmitted through the territory of the Republic of Moldova"".
The narratives are part of the Russian war propaganda and try to inoculate the idea that the West wants to draw other countries into a war against Russia. As an exponent of Russian interests in the Republic of Moldova, Igor Dodon also made statements that the West wants to use Moldovans as cannon fodder in its geopolitical struggle, that the pro-European government wants to bring NATO troops to its territory, etc. The respective rhetoric is promoted by the pro-Russian party from Chisinau long before the Russian invasion in Ukraine. This is also where the narrative that the government from Chisinau has a Russophobic policy is included. Chisinau is not interested in worsening relations with Moscow, on which it depends energetically and with which it also has important economic ties, nor in a rekindling of the conflict in the Transnistrian region, where Russian troops are stationed.

In reality, Poland is one of the most vocal supporters of the efforts to defend Ukraine from the Russian invasion.
 NEWS: ""Poland is ready to go to a much more active collaboration on the Ukrainian issue with Hungary and Romania, in order to cover its plans to seize Western Ukraine, said the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia (SVR), reports RIA Novosti agency.
Poland is trying to camouflage its expansion on Western Ukraine, deploying, in this sense, an extensive masked propaganda, announced the press office of the Foreign Intelligence Service, quoting the director of the institution, Serghei Nariskin.
[...]
According to SVR, it seems that Warsaw does not notice that her ""secret"" ambitions and frustrations have become a source of ridicule and irritation for her ""protectors"" for many years.
Among the declassified documents of the SVR there is, for the record, a particularly conclusive characterization of Poland's foreign policy, a description made in 1935 by the head of the British Foreign Ministry, Simon: <<The Polish government promotes an infantile policy of prestige, which it makes it difficult to consolidate peace in Europe and does not correspond either to the political position of Poland, nor to the military or financial position of the country>>. Today, Simon's successors express, as is known, the same thing, but in simpler and cruder forms>>, it is shown in the SVR statement.
RIA recalls that, last week, Nariskin categorized Poland's plans to establish control over western Ukraine as dangerous for the whole of Europe; according to his words, if Warsaw opens this Pandora's Box, no one will have an escape."" NARRATIVE: Poland will collaborate with Hungary and Romania to seize a part of Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, Serghei Nariskin, accuses Poland of setting up an operation to seize western Ukraine with the involvement of Hungary and Romania, but does not present any evidence. He tries to convince public opinion with the help of a document from 1935, which has nothing to do with the politics of today's Poland, a member of the EU and NATO.
In reality, the false narrative of the Russian government media, also taken over by the Romanian portal ""Vesti din Rusia"", is a reaction to the intensification of Ukrainian-Polish bilateral contacts in recent months. Recently, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, submitted a project to the Supreme Rada of the law on granting a special status to Poles in Ukraine. Polish citizens can stay on the territory of Ukraine for 18 months. They will benefit from all the rights and freedoms, just like Ukrainian citizens. Kiev and Warsaw have become very close during the war, which is not to Moscow's liking.
The Russian press distributed this news, without mentioning in the title that it is the opinion of a Russian state institution. Eadaily and Rossaprimavera wrote that Poland has already initiated a dialogue with Romania and Hungary for the invasion of Ukraine, without mentioning in the title that it is the point of view of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia
In April, Veridica dismantled a propaganda narrative on which the others that have appeared up to now are based. It is the statement of Nariskin who said that Poland will take control of its ""historical territories"" in Ukraine with the help of the USA.
In reality, Poland was the most vocal and active in combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. Warsaw has demonstrated through deeds that it is a real supporter of Ukraine. She is one of the staunchest supporters of EU sanctions against Moscow.
Both Poland, Romania and Hungary have mentioned that they will not get involved directly in the war in Ukraine, all of them being NATO member states. At the level of the North Atlantic Alliance, the decision was made to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia. Therefore, the analyzed news is false, and the theses presented by Nariskin are not based on any source or evidence.
Veridica has already written about a series of false narratives, according to which the President of Poland admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories, and Kiev would have allowed 10 thousand soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country.
Also, the Russian government press and Telegram channels, which are increasingly popular in the post-Soviet space, published a document signed by a Polish general regarding the annexation of western Ukraine. The Main Directorate of the Armed Forces of Poland announced to the public that it is a fake news and a forged document.
In fact, the Russian press is trying to demonstrate by manipulating public opinion that the efforts of Poland, Romania, Lithuania, the USA and other states to support Ukraine's defensive actions have as their real goal to annex territories of the Ukrainian state. Publication / Media:

In reality, over 85% of the residents of eastern Ukraine condemn the Russian aggression, and the people quoted by the Moscow press do not represent the legitimate Ukrainian authorities. NEWS: ""The authorities and the inhabitants of the territories liberated from Kharkiv want the entire region to become part of Russia. The Temporary Civil Administration (ACT) supports these aspirations of the people, ACT head Vitali Gancev told TASS. ""However, our direction is to join Russia. When the people hear from the new leadership that they are the real authorities, that a vertical of power has appeared, when they see the legal-normative documents that we issue, they see how the ruble came here and occupied the main economic niche, they start to adjust"". said Gancev.
[...]
About 20% of the territory of the Kharkiv region was liberated. [According to Gancev], the situation in the liberated districts is complicated. A lot of localities are bombed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the danger of the activity of subversive groups is great"". NARRATIVE: Residents of the Kharkiv region are requesting to join Russia WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the Kharkiv regional authorities have not made any statement regarding the residents' request to join Russia. The Kharkiv region is coordinated by the Regional Military Administration, led by a governor, and on the website of this institution we do not find any official information regarding the residents' desire to join Russia. The Russian press, in fact, quoted Vitali Gancev, who does not represent the Kharkiv regional authorities, being a collaborator of the Russian army of occupation. The Provisional Civil Administration, which, apparently, is a legitimate body of power, has nothing to do with the Kharkiv region or its residents. His statement Gancev about the authorities' full support of the requests of the residents of the region means the continuation of hostilities, bombings and military actions on the territory of Ukraine for the occupation of new Ukrainian localities. Therefore, the Russian army does not liberate, but occupies the territory of a sovereign state. Vitali Gancev is wanted by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, being accused of treason, collaboration with the enemy and support for Russia. He helped the Russian army to attack targets on the territory of Ukraine and transmitted information about the deployment of the Ukrainian military. The claim that the residents of the Kharkiv region want to join Russia is also false. In reality, 85% of Ukrainians in eastern Ukraine have a negative attitude towards Russia and only 4% - positive, according to a study conducted by the International Institute of Sociology in Kyiv. The majority of Russophones in eastern Ukraine are disappointed by Russia's decision to invade Ukrainian territory and bomb civilian infrastructure targets. It is worth mentioning that the head of the Kharkiv State Regional Military Administration, Oleg Sinegubov, declared that it is not necessary to evacuate the residents of the regional center because the danger of the city being occupied by Russia is not very high. He specified that Russia bombards various localities in the region daily, including the city of Kharkiv. The governor declared that he is in contact with the people from the localities occupied by Russia, emphasizing that they want to move to the territory controlled by the Ukrainian government, feeling totally insecure.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of similar false narratives. In April, the Russian press wrote that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye requested to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. In June, the press agencies in Russia distributed the story about hundreds of volunteers from Zaporozhye who will defend the region from the Ukrainian army. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the south of Ukraine, liberated by the nationalists, wants to be joined to Russia. These fake news are aimed at preparing the public opinion in Russia for new heated phases of the conflict in Ukraine and its expansion to other regions. Publication / Media:

In reality, there are no Ukrainian military aircraft on Romanian territory and Bucharest has not given any signal that it would consider involvement in the war.
NEWS: The Kherson direction is of strategic importance, it is our bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnieper, from where we can organize offensives both in the Mykolaiv district and towards Odessa, as well as to the north, said the editor of the magazine ""Arsenalul Patriei"", Aleksei Leonkov in an interview for Ukraina.ru.
[...]
,,[a counter-attack against the Russian forces] can be supported with the help of the remnants of the Ukrainian air force located on the territory of Romania. The planes are there to avoid being bombed at airports. This can be a decisive one. Kherson can be attacked more easily than Sumi or Kharkov. It's a shorter logistics and the ammunition can be brought faster from abroad"".
NARRATIVE: Romania will help Ukraine recover Kherson.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In March this year Russia stated that Ukrainian fighter jets were relocated to Romanian territory. The Ministry of National Defense from Bucharest conveyed, through a press release, that the statement is completely false and that there are no Ukrainian military aircraft on Romanian territory.
""Most likely, they are trying to speculate on the example of the Ukrainian military aircraft Sukhoi 27 that requested, on February 24 - the first day of the illegal invasion of the Russian army in Ukraine, the emergency landing in Romania"", according to the Ministry.
The Russian press and political commentators from Moscow ignored the message of the Ministry of National Defense, continuing to build false narratives about Ukrainian military bases on Romanian territory.
The expert Aleksei Leonkov is one of the most quoted by Ukraina.ru and RIA Novosti when it comes to the situation in Ukraine.
In June, Leonkov declared that Romania and the Armed Forces of Ukraine will attack Kherson. He stated that ""Zelenski plans to involve soldiers from Romania in the war [...] disguised as soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine"". The same false narrative is repeated but in different ways about the Romanian state that will support the southern offensive of Ukraine, ignoring the statements and official positions of Bucharest.
Last but not least, we must take into account the fact that Romania is a NATO state and that at the level of the Alliance the decision was made to avoid a military involvement in Ukraine, given the risk of a war with Russia that could even degenerate into a nuclear conflict. Publication / Media:

As in the past, this is also a false narrative: although some schools are indeed closing, it is a measure related to the reform and efficiency of the system and has nothing to do with the language of instruction.
NEWS: ""The President of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, has started reforms following the European example of universities, which will be fewer"".
[...] ,,Deputy from the Supreme Soviet from Tiraspol, Andrei Safonov declared that Sandu will close not only universities, but also Russian schools, as he did when he held the position of Minister of Education.
He recalled that when he was Minister of Education, Maia Sandu closed most of the Russian schools.
Now, Safonov believes, he will continue to do the same thing, but to fulfill the conditions imposed on the Republic of Moldova as a candidate for EU accession""
NARRATIVES: 1. Maia Sandu closes schools and universities in the Republic of Moldova, at the behest of the EU. 2. The pro-European government in Chisinau violates the rights of Russian speakers.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Ministry of Education and Research from Chisinau has announced that it will reduce the number of universities and research institutes, which will be absorbed by larger higher education institutions. The Ministry specified that these changes have been discussed for several years, and they are necessary in the conditions in which the number of students is decreasing.
Reforms in education, including the closing of several schools, is one of the PR topics of the political left in the last decade. It accuses the pro-European forces of closing schools to fulfill the orders of the West. The theme was exploited especially in the campaigns for the presidential elections of 2016 and 2020, to accuse Maia Sandu of being the main culprit for closing the schools.
In this context, the topic of undermining the rights of Russian-speaking minorities is promoted, including by Moscow
OBJECTIVE: To inoculate the idea that the authorities from Chisinau violate the rights of Russian speakers
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: It was not Maia Sandu who announced the reform in the field of higher education, but the Ministry of Education. Even if Maia Sandu remains the de facto leader of the ruling party in Chisinau, not all the decisions of the authorities can be attributed to her.
The reform of the university education system in the Republic of Moldova has been talked about for several years, starting from the Education Code, voted in 2014. The process has nothing to do with obtaining the status of a candidate country for accession, offered by the European Council on June 23, 2022.
In the Republic of Moldova, the number of students has halved since the beginning of the century - from 630 thousand to approximately 330 thousand. During this period, the number of schools decreased by approximately 20%. Both Romanian and Russian-language schools were closed. The Minister of Education and Research, Anatolie Topala, recently stated that in the Republic of Moldova there are 972 schools with Romanian language teaching and 261 with Russian or mixed language teaching, which corresponds to the ratio between Romanian and Russian speakers, according to the last census .

The narrative circulates in the context in which the Chamber of Deputies adopted a law of the whistleblowers who deprive them of the protection envisaged by the EU.
NEWS: The ""siphon law"", that is, the ""pourer's law"", or in European bird language - the ""integrity whistleblower law"" made waves not only in this country, but also in the entire European Union. It seems that we are going to be sanctioned because, by law, we do not give sufficient protection to these foundries and they complained about this situation to Brussels. And Brussels reacts and sanctions the Romanian state. Well done, we have returned from full neo-Marxism to the communism of Stalin's time,"" says the journalist Sorin Rosca Stanescu in a short video. NARRATIVES: 1. Whistleblowers are just ""turners"". 2. The EU will unfairly sanction Romania for the provisions of the whistleblower law voted last week in Parliament.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On June 29, the Chamber of Deputies adopted the public whistleblower law in a controversial formula, which limits the rights of those who report irregularities in the institutions where they work, in the context that Romania will receive funds of tens of billions of euros under PNRR from the EU.
This raised reasonable suspicions that European funds could be defrauded now even more easily, together with the inhibition and discouragement of public whistleblowers who could expose such practices.
The law in question had no less than three drafts in two terms of justice ministers and was voted by the current coalition formed by PSD-PNL-UDMR, but also by opposition parties, such as AUR or the national minorities, with 216 votes for , while 55 parliamentarians (USR and 13 unaffiliated) voted against.
The law was truncated by a series of key provisions, which do not respect the European legislation in the matter. For example, the principle of good faith of the whistleblower in the public interest, a measure required by the EU Directive in the field, has disappeared.
Another provision that disappeared from the form of the law voted in Romania is that notifications are destroyed after two years, although the Directive provides that they are kept as long as necessary. Also, the whistleblowers have the right to publicly disclose the information regarding the violation of the law only after three months and only if they have reported internally beforehand.
On June 30, Laura Codruta Kovesi, head of the European Package, stated in a press release that she is analyzing a possible referral to the European Commission for the activation of the mechanism for conditioning European funds by the rule of law in Romania due to the way in which the directive was transposed regarding the integrity whistleblower.
It should be mentioned that the one who dealt with the emasculation of the law is Laura Vicol, a PSD deputy by profession, a lawyer, about whom RISE Romania wrote that she was in contact with the leaders of the Bodyguard Clan from Bucharest and whose conversations with them were published last year. RISE wrote that this Bodyguard Clan generates profits from prostitution and cocaine trafficking and that it operates in Romania, Switzerland, Germany or France.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing the false idea in the eyes of public opinion that the public whistleblower would be a ""turner"" of the type from the time of the Security.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: EU Directive 2019/1937 on the protection of whistleblowers entered into force on December 16, 2019 and stipulates that public whistleblowers are vital for maintaining an open and transparent society, as they expose incorrect behavior or hidden threats. They are also protected by law. Public whistleblowers are people who report violations of the law and abuses committed in institutions, so they play an important role in strengthening the rule of law. Security collaborators, on the other hand - the so-called ""turners"" - were involved in acts of political policing and their role was diametrically opposed to that of whistleblowers, as they contributed to the consolidation and maintenance of an oppressive regime.
It should be noted that the one who blames the law on public whistleblowers, whom he calls whistleblowers, is himself such a ""turner"" of the Security proven by CNSAS, but also convicted for corruption and forming an organized criminal group.
The journalist Sorin Rosca Stanescu ""turned"" for the former Securitate from the time of Ceausescu under several pseudonyms such as ""H15"" or ""Deleanu"". Moreover, he acknowledged his relationship with the former Securitate.
Then, Brussels does not punish Romania, as the author claims, otherwise a promoter of Russian propaganda narratives demonizing the EU and the West in general, as Veridica has demonstrated on several occasions. The subliminal attempt is again to transmit the Russian meta-narrative that Romania is ""a colony of the West"".
Romania, like any other member state, is obliged by this statute to transpose the European legislation into the national one. Moreover, after successive delays, Romania has been in infringement proceedings since the beginning of June because it did not transpose the European Commission's directive on public whistleblowers in a reasonable time.

""Zelenski wants a court - he will have it. But he himself will be on the dock. The truth cannot be hidden and the international community will have to designate Zelensky as a war criminal,"" Cerniak told RIA Novosti.
According to him, Zelenski will be tried for a series of crimes against humanity.
""He must answer for the genocide against his own people, after which he hid behind a human shield. He must answer for the biological laboratories where experiments took place, for the killing of civilians in Luhansk and Donetsk, for the torture of Russian soldiers, for fascist propaganda. The list can be continued"", said the deputy""
NARRATIVE: Volodymyr Zelensky will be tried for war crimes.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The news distributed by the Russian press and Telegram channels from Russia and from the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk is not based on facts, but on the assumptions of a parliamentarian. Some publications did not mention in the title that it is the opinion of a politician, but presented the designation of Zelenski as a war criminal as a fact.
The headline of the news published by RIA Novosti says that at the moment humanity qualifies Zelenski as a war criminal. At the same time, the text of the news specifies that Zelenski could be tried for war crimes, this being, in fact, the personal conviction of a Russian deputy. Under the same aspect of manipulating public opinion, the news appears on the page of the ""Krasnaia Vesna"" Information Agency and on the Tsargrad TV station.
This technique of manipulation with the help of headlines partially separated from the content of the news is increasingly used by the Russian press in propaganda narratives.
In fact, the false narrative is a reaction to the statement of the president of Ukraine, who asked the UN to provide a definition of the terrorist state based on which Russia could be excluded from the UN General Assembly.
Deputy Aleksei Cerniak and the Russian press resume in a much more concise and systematized form the disinformation messages regarding Ukraine from the last 8 years.
The accusations from the Russian media against Kiev regarding the organization of a genocide in Ukraine are very old, being a justification for the war started on February 24 by the Kremlin. In reality, Ukrainians, including Russian speakers, are fighting the Russian invader on their territory. Russia is bombing Ukrainian towns, including with weapons prohibited by international law. The victims in Ukraine are caused by the Russian invasion, not by President Zelensky's decision to organize a defense of his state.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives whose main message is ""genocide organized by Kiev against Russophones"". According to the latest fake news of this kind, the Ukrainian army is massacring Russophones while fleeing from eastern Ukraine. In reality, Ukrainian forces they continue to resist, and the political leaders from Kiev declare that they will fight for each locality to defend the local population, including the Russian speakers, from the Russian invaders.
The president of Ukraine is also accused of supporting US laboratories, where biological weapons were created. This false justification of the Russian invasion was the subject of several press articles and TV shows, without any evidence for more than 4 months of the war. In reality, there were no laboratories in Ukraine where biological weapons were produced or developed. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons.
Veridica dismantled the basic narrative, which constitutes one of the cores of the war propaganda, according to which Russia is bombing Ukrainian cities to destroy biological weapons laboratories and save humanity. Moscow did not present any concrete proof of the existence of such laboratories, but justified the attack on Ukrainian cities and Snake Island by the need to destroy them.
Zelenski is also accused of promoting fascist ideology, but the fact that Nazi, fascist and communist symbols are prohibited in Ukraine is not mentioned. In May, the Russian press wrote that the Ukrainian neo-Nazis are holding civilians captive in the Kharkiv region, but they hid the fact that most of the local councils claimed war crimes committed by the Russian military.
In order to absolve Russia, the pro-Kremlin press wrote starting on February 24 that the Ukrainian military are neo-Nazis and commit war crimes against civilians in eastern and southern Ukraine. In reality, it is Russia that is bombing Ukrainian cities and has destroyed numerous civilian targets, including apartment buildings, schools, etc. The crimes are documented by journalists and independent investigators. According to a study by the School of Economics in Kyiv, in just 4 months the damage caused to Ukraine's economy by Russia is 600 billion dollars.
Therefore, not Zelenski, but Putin could be classified as a war criminal, there are already initiatives in this regard from Kiev. In Ukraine, the collection of evidence continues, with the support of teams of experts from the EU, to hold Russia accountable for war crimes. Publication / Media:

The topic of anti-Russian sanctions is exploited by Russian propaganda and Russian influence agencies in the Republic of Moldova and is included in the Kremlin's list of threats to Chisinau.
NEWS: ""If the scoundrels from the government will vote for alignment with the sanctions against Russia, in the fall and winter, Moldova will endure hunger, cold and poverty."" The warning comes from the leader of the ""SOR"" Party, Ilan Sor, after our country has obtained the status of a candidate for joining the European Union, reports Partidulsor.MD. In a video recording posted on his Facebook page, Ilan Sor is convinced that the authorities of the Republic of Moldova have concluded an agreement regarding our country obtaining the status of a candidate for joining the European Union, in exchange for aligning with the sanctions against Russia. According to Ilan Sor, this is the most unprofitable business that could ever be done in relation to Moldovan citizens. ""First of all, obtaining the status of a candidate for joining the EU means long years of waiting and vain hopes. Secondly, the imposition of sanctions against Russia will have an immediate boomerang effect. Usually, an agreement is concluded in favor of obtaining some economic or, in the worst case, political benefits. The results of the recently signed agreement will result, however, in the loss of the energy source and a market for Moldovan products without alternative solutions. Also, this will practically lead to the renunciation of the status of neutrality provided for in the Constitution. At the same time, it will mean long-term tensions in the relations with strategic partners and the cross will be put on the prospect of resolving the Transnistrian conflict"", said Ilan Sor. [...]

Ria.ru: Political scientist Manastirli: Moldova's alignment with sanctions will return the country to the Middle Ages
Chisinau's official alignment with the sanctions against Russia will have serious economic consequences for Moldova, the director of the Balkan Center, political scientist Serghei Manastirli, said in a comment for RiaNovosti. [...]
""Obtaining the EU candidate status is interpreted by the current government of the republic as a defense against external threats. Joining the anti-Russian sanctions is interpreted as proof of its loyalty to the West. If Chisinau will move from words to deeds, there will be response actions in the energy field. Joining Moldova in the war of sanctions will be followed by an economic catastrophe for the country - Moldova will return to the medieval era"", believes Manastirli. [...] NARRATIVES: 1. If the government aligns itself with the sanctions against Russia, Moldova will endure hunger, cold and poverty. 2. The government concluded an agreement regarding obtaining the status of a candidate for joining the European Union in exchange for aligning with the sanctions against Russia. 3. Obtaining the candidate state will lead to the loss of energy sources and a market for Moldovan products to which there is no alternative. 4. The status of a candidate country for the EU means giving up neutrality. 5. The status of a candidate country for the EU will prevent the resolution of the Transnistrian conflict.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to discredit and undermine the Republic of Moldova's approach to the European Union.
CONTEXT: Against the background of the war in Ukraine started by the Russian Federation, the Republic of Moldova recently received the status of a candidate country for EU accession. This success is also due to the pro-European government in Chisinau, mainly with the president Maia Sandu, who is very well seen and supported in the West. On the other hand, the Republic of Moldova is severely affected economically because of the war, which makes the pro-European government difficult. At the same time, Russia, which supports a separatist regime on the left side of the Dniester, has always opposed the Republic of Moldova's approach to the European Union. Chisinau condemned the war in Ukraine from the first day. Former Russian president Dmitrii Medvedev, vice president of the Security Council, declared that if Moldova aligns itself with anti-Russian sanctions, it will be left without energy resources from Russia.
Ilan Sor is a fugitive politician, sentenced by the first court to seven and a half years in prison in the case of the theft of the billion from the banking system of the Republic of Moldova. His case has been pending at the Court of Appeal since 2017. To get rid of the criminal files, Sor entered politics, being initially elected mayor of the city of Orhei, then deputy in the Chisinau Parliament. Ilan Sor fled the Republic of Moldova in 2019, together with the oligarch Vlad Plahotniuc. His party is generally supported by elderly people and he entered the Parliament thanks to the social campaigns he runs, especially product donations and the opening of some social shops.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Although it has condemned the Russian war and aggression in Ukraine from the first day, the Republic of Moldova has not yet aligned itself with international sanctions in order not to provoke aggressive actions from Russia and because it depends on Russian gas. At the same time, the Republic of Moldova respects all policies and restrictions regarding international payment systems. The Republic of Moldova does not allow, for example, the re-export of products to the Russian Federation. Moreover, the alignment of Chisinau with international sanctions would have more symbolic than practical value. The Republic of Moldova is a small country with a precarious economy, and possible sanctions from Chisinau would not be able to cause significant losses to Russia. Although the European Council appealed to all states to align themselves with the EU sanctions, this subject is not a mandatory requirement or a point on the negotiations with the EU in the accession process of the Republic of Moldova. The recommendations of the European Commission relate to the reforms that Chisinau must implement, especially in justice, the fight against corruption, the rule of law. The topic of anti-Russian sanctions is exploited by Russian propaganda and Russian influence agencies in the Republic of Moldova. This is included in the Kremlin's list of threats to Chisinau.
Even if currently, due to the war, Moldovan producers do not have the opportunity to export to the eastern markets - Russia, Belarus - the European Union, which represents the largest market in the world, will increase the quotas for Moldovan products. Moreover, the EU is the main commercial partner of the Republic of Moldova, with over 60 percent of goods exported to the European market, while exports to the CIS have decreased in the last five years from 20 to 15%.
Regarding the narrative that the status of a candidate country for the EU means giving up neutrality, this is a lie, since the EU is part of a neutral country. Anyway, the Republic of Moldova has the right to determine its own defense and security methods. On the other hand, the experience of the last 30 years shows that ex-Soviet states that did not benefit from the protection of NATO and the EU - the Republic of Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine - were attacked by Russia, which, however, refrained from similar actions against the members of the two organizations. The status of a candidate country to the EU will not prevent the resolution of the Transnistrian conflict, on the contrary, the chances of this conflict being resolved with the start of the EU accession negotiations increase, as it is known that the region benefits from the advantages of relations and exports to the EU.

This was published in the conditions where Russia is accused of deporting Ukrainians, and the advance of its forces and the intense bombardment of some civilian targets have forced millions of people to flee.
NEWS: ""In Ukraine, a law could be adopted regarding the forced deportation of people from the area of ​​military actions,"" Serghei Gaidai, the head of the ""Luhansk Regional Military Administration"" appointed by Kiev, said live on Ukraina 24.
Civilians from the city of Lisiyansk in the frontline area of ​​the Luhansk People's Republic protested against this idea during its time under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Gaidai declared that in the northwestern city of the People's Republic of Luhansk, the situation of the Ukrainian military is very complicated, the fighting continues, there are about 15 thousand people in the town.
""There were proposals by certain deputies to deport this city. I told them: very well, quickly adopt a draft law on deportation and we will transport them from here"".
[...]
The residents claim that the ""Ukrainian army is attacking them"" and the Ukrainians are ""killing our children"". According to the television, the residents of the city of Lisiyansk ""came out in front of the Ukrainian military forces who were going to deport them"".
NARRATIVE: The residents of the Luhansk region will be deported by Kiev.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The beginning and the end of the news, published by RIA Novosti, demonstrate that the author of the information does not know clearly if Kiev tried to deport the residents of the Luhansk region or if this initiative is only at the level of political discussions. According to the false narrative, Kiev is going to adopt a deportation law, then it is mentioned that the residents of the city of Lysiyansk came out in front of the Ukrainian military forces who ""were going to deport them"" without any law! It is not clear why it would have been necessary by a law if the deportation of Russian speakers was to follow anyway.
Moreover, the Russian press writes that the city of Lisiansk is under the control of the armed forces of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, but Russian speakers fear a deportation law that may be adopted in Kiev. It is not clear why residents of a city no longer under Ukrainian control should fear a Ukrainian law. In reality, fighting is still taking place in Lysiyansk and Ukrainian forces continue to resist.
Apart from a series of logical contradictions in the text of the news, Russian propaganda totally distorted the statement of the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. He did not say that a deportation law is to be adopted.
""There were proposals from some people to forcibly evacuate the region. But this means deportation. Our state is called Ukraine, not Russia. We will not proceed in this way,"" Gaidai said.
In other words, the official mentioned that the deportation of civilians is prohibited in Ukraine, unlike Russia, which deports Ukrainians. On the website of the Parliament of Ukraine, we do not find any draft law that would refer to the deportation or evacuation of people.
In fact, at the end of May, Ukraine reported on the forced deportation to Russia of 1.4 million Ukrainians. Kiev asked international organizations to monitor the situation of Ukrainians forcibly deported to Russia.
Veridica recently dismantled a series of false narratives, according to which the Ukrainian army is massacring Russian speakers during the withdrawal from Donbass, and the EU is accused of deporting refugee men to Ukraine to be enlisted in the Ukrainian army.
The purpose of these narratives is to sow mistrust among the population of eastern Ukraine towards the Ukrainian authorities and to discourage the process of territorial defense. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""Joe Biden announced that he will finance with 14 million dollars the engineering studies and design of mini-nuclear power plants in Romania, although the obligation of these operations rests with the producer. It is not known what this money will be spent on, because there is total secrecy surrounding the project. Most likely, an attempt will be made to expedite the experimental location of the modular reactors in Romania, under the conditions that they should have been ready in 2028 [...] As the thermal power plants are completely closed in 2025, it is very possible that in Romania do the first experiments of the modular reactors and hurry things up, skipping important stages [...] Because the reactors emit a certain amount of radiation, an exclusion radius must be calculated around them. In the case of the former thermal power plant from Doicesti, in Dambovita county, where it was established that the first reactor will be located, the neighborhoods that must disappear are a national road, a railway, an enterprise and several houses of the people of the commune""
NARRATIVES: 1. Romania is an American colony that is exploited by the West. 2. The USA will conduct nuclear experiments in Romania with new technologies.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: The White House has announced that it will offer 14 million dollars to Romania to support engineering and design studies for the construction of a plant based on the technology of modular nuclear mini-reactors of the SMR type. ""This investment aims to mobilize a multi-billion dollar effort and showcase US ingenuity in the advanced nuclear sector, accelerate the transition to clean energy, create thousands of jobs and strengthen Europe's energy security, respecting at the same time, the highest standards of safety, security and nuclear non-proliferation,"" the White House said in a press release.
Romania will be the first country in Europe, thanks to the Romanian-American strategic partnership, to implement this innovative technology. Moreover, it benefits from all the necessary certification from the USA.
Both President Klaus Iohannis and Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca welcomed the decision of the American presidential administration.
""Ensuring energy security is a common objective of the Strategic Partnership between Romania and the USA,"" Klaus Iohannis wrote on Twitter on Sunday.
""The US decision to finance with 14 million dollars the preliminary stage of engineering and design studies for the development of small modular reactors (SMR) in Romania is the essential component of the development of the national civil nuclear program. Along with the construction of reactors 3 and 4 at the Cernavoda Power Plant, the use of the new type of SMR technology will contribute to strengthening Romania's energy profile, in accordance with the European vision of environmental protection and the assumed decarbonization targets,"" Prime Minister Ciuca said.
The nuclear power plant that the American company NuScale will build in Romania at Doicesti, Dambovita, could have up to 12 modular reactors, and each module has an installed power of 77MWh, which would give Romania 924 MWh, i.e. over 25 % of total energy consumption.
Currently, Romania takes approximately 20% of its energy, i.e. 700MWh, from the two units of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant.
It should also be mentioned that Romania aims to align with the EU norms regarding green energy and the process of reducing CO2 emissions. Therefore, the implementation of this new technology towards the horizon of 2028 will replace the decommissioning of many coal-fired plants, which are much more polluting.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing a feeling of panic among public opinion regarding the possibility of nuclear accidents.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Romania, viewed and exploited as a colony of the West, is a recurring narrative in Russian propaganda that Veridica has constantly deconstructed in recent years.
Through this meta-narrative, an attempt is made to instill a false sense of patriotism with a xenophobic and slovenly tinge, especially among the older population who lived in the era of Nicolae Ceausescu.
The authors try to inoculate the idea that Romania is a second-rate nation, which will never be accepted in the club of the West, because it would de facto belong to the East, controlled in a Cold War paradigm by Russia.
The new nuclear technologies that the American company NuScale wants to implement in Romania are certified in the USA, being the first of their kind to receive approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), at the end of a very extensive testing process that lasted over 10 years and cost over 500 million dollars and over 2 million hours of work.
The US authority certified in its report the SMR technology as safe and ecological.
In an answer to Veridica, Nuclearelectrica stated that the location of the future power plant in Doicesti, which will operate on the basis of these SMR-type nuclear mini-reactors, has received all the necessary approvals.
""The location of the former Doicesti thermal power plant has obtained all the qualifications in terms of security, being in accordance with the design criteria and security principles of the NuScale small modular reactors, and it fully complies with the location criteria required by international and national standards"", he stated for Veridica, the director of NuclearElectrica, Cosmin Ghita.
SMR technology is not exactly new, and NuScale small modular reactors are based on pressurized light water reactor (PWR) technology, which has a history of over 60 years and is currently in commercial use in over 300 PWR reactors worldwide.
Also, the NuScale modular reactors have an advanced nuclear safety system that ensures shutdown and self-cooling for an unlimited period of time, without the intervention of an operator or a computer, without the need for additional water and without the need for electricity (no sources backup power supply, such as emergency diesel generators).
""This means that even in the event of a power outage, the NuScale modular reactor can shut down under conditions of maximum safety, automatically and can go into a state of maximum protection for personnel and the environment for an indefinite period, without needing external energy sources. They have seven levels of protection, compared to the five existing at the current large power plants to ensure the highest security standards for the population and the environment,"" Nuclearelectrica director Cosmin Ghita also told Veridica.
Last but not least, the NuScale technology has a very small exclusion zone and allows the plant to be placed in the immediate vicinity of the sources of heat extraction, for heating, near homes and can be placed on the site of the plants of former plants taken out of use.
""Therefore, the risk for communities is very low compared to the imposed limits. Hence the very small exclusion zone, limited to the borders of the site. Thus, there is no impact on the health of the inhabitants. Not even for those who will live immediately outside the exclusion zone or at another distance"", concluded Cosmin Ghita.

In reality, the deportation of refugees to their country of origin is prohibited by international law, so Ukrainian citizens who fled the war to the EU cannot be sent back.
NEWS: ""The European Union authorities are thinking of mass deporting Ukrainian refugees from their territory in order to help Kiev in terms of mobilization in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, announced the vice-president of the military-civilian administration in the Kherson region, Kiril Stremousov. He told Ukraina.ru that this step of the EU takes place against the background of the refusal of the inhabitants of Ukraine to fight on the side of the regime in Kiev or to somehow help the country's army.
Now the EU is examining the possibility of deporting all Ukrainian men to Ukraine to support the ""moghilization"" (funeral - ed.), said Stremousov, adding that he did not make any mistake in his statement, as enlistment in the army in Ukraine is not a mobilization, but a one-way ticket.
Ukrainians no longer understand the point of filling the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and giving their lives not for a state, but for a certain regime. EU help was needed, explains the vice-president.""
NARRATIVE: The EU will deport refugee men to Ukraine to be enlisted in the Ukrainian army.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukrainian citizens cannot be deported to Ukraine because they are legally on the territory of the EU states. International legislation and the recommendations of human rights organizations prohibit the deportation of people who have fled conflict zones. At the same time, the deportation of a foreign citizen can take place in case of committing crimes on the territory of the host state, the court's decision being necessary.
According to the European Convention on Human Rights, foreign citizens can be deported only in the situations provided by law. In other words, the EU cannot out of the blue adopt a political and discriminatory decision regarding the deportation of Ukrainian men with the aim of being enlisted in the army. Moreover, people who have applied for refugee status are offered protection at the level of the EU states. Also, the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees prohibits the signatory states from deporting people who have fled the war.
It should be noted that the Russian press does not cite European sources, close to the political decision-makers in the EU, but a representative of the Russian occupation body on the territory of Ukraine, called the military-civilian administration of the Kherson region. Kiril Stremousov is wanted on the territory of Ukraine, being accused of treason and collaboration with the army of the aggressor state. The regional party of which Stremousov was a member was banned on the territory of Ukraine.
Neither the Russian media nor the collaborator Kiril Stremousov provide any proof of the EU's intentions to deport the Ukrainians. There is no declaration at the EU level in this regard, nor any request at the level of the relevant Ukrainian ministries.
The propaganda narrative seeks to undermine the image of the EU and the Ukrainian government (which send people to their deaths) but also to demoralize the Ukrainian forces through formulas like ""a one-way ticket"". Publication / Media:

When such important and powerful countries as Great Britain leave the EU, and Moldova, with its unresolved problems, including territorial ones, rushes somewhere, I think it is wrong"".
And the former communist president, Vladimir Voronin, declared that the state of the candidate country does not offer any clear prospect of joining the EU and that, thus, the Republic of Moldova is ""linked with a chain, so that it cannot collaborate with its strategic partners - The Russian Federation"".
The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, declared that the countries that want to obtain the status of candidate for EU accession must take a Russophobic position, that Russia will monitor whether they ""submit to the EU's demands or maintain their independence."" We do not believe that Russophobia will disappear, but the path is chosen by the Europeans"". He also said that the EU, together with NATO, is gathering a coalition to fight against the Russian Federation, just as Hitler did against the USSR.
Earlier, in the same context, the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov declared that ""they are trying to transform the Republic of Moldova into a ""second Ukraine"". And the spokeswoman of the Russian MFA Maria Zaharova declared that ""What we are seeing now regarding the accession to the EU it has nothing to do with the objective economic reality, but with the political situation... The main criterion is Russophobia and the anti-Russian oath"". NARRATIVES: 1. The Republic will not become a member of the EU, and the candidate status does not offer it anything. 2. The European Union is about to fall apart, being abandoned by important states like Great Britain. 3. By offering the status of a candidate country, the Republic of Moldova is prevented by the EU from having relations with Russia. 4. Countries that want to obtain EU candidate status must be Russophobic. 5. The EU and NATO gather a war coalition against Russia.
OBJECTIVE: Through these narratives, the Russian Federation and the politicians from Chisinau who serve the interests of the Kremlin try to minimize the importance of obtaining the status of accession candidate for the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine.
CONTEXT: The Republic of Moldova and Ukraine received the status of candidate countries for EU accession on Thursday, June 23, 2022, and Georgia was recognized for its European perspective. The status was obtained in a record time, just two months after submitting the application for membership, in the context of the war in Ukraine. The decision was unanimously supported by all 27 member countries of the European Union. The three states are former Soviet republics, in which Moscow has maintained a strong influence exercised through various levers - political, economic, energetic, or informational. All three were the target of Russian military aggression.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The narratives are part of Russian anti-Western, anti-EU and anti-NATO propaganda. This intensified in the context of the war started by Russia in Ukraine and the rapprochement of the former Soviet republics with the European Union. Moscow tried to prevent any approach to the European Union of the states from the former Soviet space.
Obtaining the status of a candidate country for accession is the most important step of the Republic of Moldova in its European course. The EU promotes institutional models based on freedoms, rights and the well-being of citizens. The fight against corruption, the judicial and institutional reforms required by the EU for accession are primarily for the benefit of Moldovan citizens. The EU has offered and continues to offer economic support to the Republic of Moldova, it is Chisinau's most important commercial partner and offers Moldovan producers the largest market in the world. Also, the European External Action Service announced that it will open the energy platform of the European Union for the common purchase of gas for the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia and will contribute to the development of the connections of the three countries to the European electrical networks. Moldovan citizens benefit from visa-free travel in EU countries. The negotiation period will bring more benefits, including access to non-adherence funds.
On the other hand, the Russian Federation is not a model of development, on the contrary, it is a state based on an authoritarian, aggressor regime, which militarily attacked Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova.
The narrative regarding the disintegration of the EU, taken over by Igor Dodon, was also stated in the same context by the former Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the vice-president of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, who recently declared that the EU will disappear before Ukraine is accepted as part of it.
The European Union has never asked to break Chisinau's relations with Moscow, and the Republic of Moldova has no reason to end relations with the Russian Federation, on which it depends for energy; in addition, it has traditional trade ties, and several Moldovan citizens work in the Russian Federation. Also, the Republic of Moldova, which is a small state, does not have the military and human capabilities to get involved in a war against Russia.
As for the so-called Russophobia of the EU, this is another false narrative without any factual basis; Brussels took measures (sanctions) against Moscow only as a result of its aggression, and the Europeans tried to maintain a dialogue with the Russian side even after the large-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Regarding the war coalition against Russia, NATO has repeatedly emphasized that it wants to avoid a conflict with Russia and has taken measures to prevent possible incidents that could lead to the escalation of the situation. Publication / Media:

In reality, Bandera was not canonized and there is no initiative in this regard.
NEWS: Stepan Bandera was recognized as a saint in Ukraine. The canonization decision was adopted on June 20 at the Synod of Bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. It is a generally known fact that Bandera was an active collaborator with the Nazis. However, in Ukraine he was declared a national hero for the reason that now there everyone has a loyal attitude towards Nazism.
And here Bandera is already a saint. Unfortunately, every time it seems that the Kiev regime is definitively falling into sin, it proves again that it can fall even further into the fiery hell"".
NARRATIVE: The nationalist leader Stepan Bandera was canonized in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In order to prove to the public opinion in Russia and the population of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk that Ukrainian society is a Nazi society and the special denazification operation deserves to be continued, the Russian press writes that the nationalist leader of the last century, Stepan Bandera, was canonized by The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which obtained the Tomos of autonomy in 2019. In reality, there has never been such an initiative. On June 20, the Holy Synod did not take place, as the Russian press mentions. The last Synod of Bishops took place in Kiev on May 24, according to the website of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. On the official website you can find all the initiatives and discussions about canonization, which from the point of view of the procedure could last from several months to several years. Stepan Bandera is not mentioned in any way.
The Russian press also cites a document signed by the Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine Epiphany, in which it is said that the canonization decision ""comes into force today"". The document contains serious stylistic mistakes in the Ukrainian language and does not respect the form and spirit of documents of this kind .
At the same time, the Russian press ignored an important nuance during the construction of this propaganda narrative - Stepan Bandera was Greek-Catholic and theoretically cannot be canonized by a church other than the one to which he professedly belonged. The image used by the Russian media with the faces, the icon of Stepan Bandera was copied from the TSN news site from Kiev, it is about Stepan's father, Andrei Bandera, a Ukrainian Greek Catholic leader, who was killed in 1941. There was an initiative to recognize Andrei Bandera as a martyr of the Greek Catholic Church in 2015, but without any result. The Russian press copied Andrei Bandera's image from the news published in 2015 on the Kiev website and reported that it is an icon of Stepan Bandera.
The propaganda narrative justifies in the eyes of public opinion in Russia the military actions carried out against the population of Ukraine, demonstrating that the Ukrainians are dominated by neo-Nazi ideas and are increasingly falling ""toward the fiery hell"". Publication / Media:

In reality, the museum exhibits were evacuated from the east and south of the country to the western regions or from the exhibition halls to shelters in order not to be destroyed by the Russian bombings.
NEWS: ""Zelensky pays for Western armaments with exhibits from Ukrainian museums,"" informs the Telegram channel Harkov Z.
At the beginning of this year, in Kharkiv, Nikolaev, Dnepropetrovsk and other cities, several exhibits were prepared for evacuation.
In March-April, most museums stopped working, the halls became deserted.
In the press we find a lot of information about the closed museums, but no one knows where the exhibits were transported. These days I found out that most of the funds of the History and Art Museum in Kharkiv, but also from Dnepropetrovsk, Nikolaev and even Lvov are in Denmark in the Osgor Museum. Moreover, some of the exhibits are already presented to the public.
Not all the precious exhibits are in Denmark - some have already been included in private collections or are in museums in Western countries, which for a pair of old tanks came into possession of historical relics...""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine pays off Western armaments with Ukrainian museum exhibits.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The news starts from a post on the Telegram channel of the pro-Russian politician Aleksandr Semchenko, who writes that Ukraine paid for the weapons received from the West with museum exhibits. He mentioned that, for a pair of old tanks, ""the Westerners came into possession of historical relics"", the information being distributed by the Russian press.
The only evidence posted on the Telegram channel is the image of a painting transported, the faces, from Kharkiv abroad. In reality, the image represents the evacuation of a painting from the ""Andrei Septitki"" National Museum in Lviv. The evacuation took place in March against the background of bombings on the towns in western Ukraine. All the paintings were moved from the exhibition hall to shelters.
The evacuation of the museum fund took place in the context of Russia's destruction of some museums and cultural monuments in Ukraine. On May 7, the Russian military bombed the ""Grigori Skovoroda"" National Museum in Skovorodinovka. More than 25 works of the painter Maria Primacenko were destroyed in the Museum in Ivankovo ​​in the Kyiv region. Also cultural homes, theaters, universities and schools. For the defense of these and other civilian objectives, Kiev requested armaments from the West.
The Russian press does not provide any proof, apart from the fake photographic one, to prove that the Ukrainian exhibits are offered to the European states in exchange for armaments. According to an analysis carried out by the Ukrainian press, most museums face difficulties during the evacuation, and this process is regulated by an order of the Cabinet of Ministers, which, among other things, prohibits the transportation of exhibits abroad.

The narrative takes elements from the ""Great Reset"" conspiracy theory.
NEWS: ""Invited to a debate program on current issues, Iosefina Pascal asked a representative of the National Institute of Statistics (INS) about what would happen to the data collected from the population census. The latter specified that the data will be anonymized, and after the statistics, will be deleted. The GOLD FM journalist disapproves of the INS representative claiming that the data from the census would reach European institutions.
""The data on the state of health of Romanians, information on birth rates and mortality will reach the World Health Organization (WHO). Also, depending on the interest of that European entity, the INS will execute and transmit the so-called deleted information. A census of the population is necessary, but what happened this year and what will happen again should raise many question marks"" - says Iosefina Pascal"". NARRATIVE: Romanians will have their personal data collected, which will then be handed over to the WHO for it to use at its own discretion.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: Romania started the population and housing census on March 14, with the self-review stage that was completed on May 27. Later, after this date until July 17, the stage of face-to-face interviews will take place, carried out by reviewers with the help of tablets.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the census was postponed for a year, and for the first time it will no longer be done on paper, but in electronic format, in order to greatly avoid contacts.
According to the INS, people who refuse self-review will not be fined, but those reviewed and who refuse to provide information or provide erroneous/incomplete data may be fined from 1,000 lei to 3,000 lei, according to article 54 of GEO 19 /2020.
Adherents of the conspiracy theory and the media that rely on pro-Kremlin narratives in Romania used the occasion of the census to issue narratives regarding these statistics that are collected periodically and based on which public policies are naturally drawn up in the fields of health, education, economic - social and so on.
The reviewers are authorized persons who act according to the law, and the data collection is in accordance with the national legislation. Moreover, it is for the first time that the population and housing count will be 100% computerized.
""Romania needs to know the resident population not only at the national level, but also at the level of all localities. The data obtained are used to calculate indicators at the European level. Certain European funds are distributed in relation to the population of a certain locality. Localities can receive funds depending on the resident population, which we calculate on the occasion of the census,"" declared INS president Tudorel Andrei for Digi24.
OBJECTIVE: Influencing the population to undermine their trust in medical institutions worldwide.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: The data normally collected by the National Institute of Statistics at the national level anyway reach Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, responsible for the publication of statistics and indicators, at the European level, which allow comparisons between countries and regions.
Eurostat collaborates with the World Health Organization (WHO) on such statistics.
Also, the World Health Organization manages and maintains a wide range of databases related to global health and well-being, in accordance with the mandate of the WHO member states, including Romania.
When the INS representative says on the show that the data will be anonymized and deleted, Iosefina Pascal does not come with any evidence that would contradict this, but launches a theory without being able to prove this.
The WHO is one of the frequent targets of anti-vaxxers and followers of the ""conspiracy theory"". In Romania, the WHO was the favorite target of conservative groups and the media that were in charge of spreading fake news and disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Veridica he clearly signaled this before.
The fact that the WHO could use statistical data about the health of Romanians goes against the logic of existence and the central mission of this world organization that has been taking care of people's health globally for decades.
Moreover, the author of the article, Iosefina Pascal, is a constant promoter of disinformation related to vaccination and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Iosefina Pascal's thesis is further part of the conspiracy theory that speaks of the ""Great Reset"", a conspiracy narrative that is also promoted on Russian social networks such as Odnosklassniki.
The great reset, in the vision of the conspiracists, refers to the enslavement of ordinary people by a ""world occult"", an elite of very rich characters with petty goals.
Veridica dismantled this narrative and explained that this term was initially promoted by characters close to former American President Donald Trump. ""The Great Reset"" was an expression used at the Davos Economic Forum in September 2020.
""There is an urgent need for stakeholders to cooperate globally for the simultaneous management of the direct consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. In order to improve the situation in the world, the World Economic Forum is starting the ""Great Reset"" initiative.
From here, it was only one step for these statements to enter the area of ​​conspiracy about what, in fact, would mean the ""Great Reset"". Repeated obsessively by Russian propaganda in the main media subordinate to the Kremlin, they were picked up and constantly regurgitated and in the media vehicles in Romania that promote these Russian narratives.

In reality, Russia is forcibly mobilizing Ukrainian civilians from the occupied localities in this region, violating international conventions, and the city of Zaporozhye is still under the control of the Ukrainian army.
NEWS: ""Lists of volunteers for the defense of the land by the Ukrainian army have started to appear in the Zaporizhia region, there are already over 200 applicants, said the head of the military-civilian administration of the region, Evgheni Balitki.
""We have our own militia. We already have battalions of people, we are not registering them yet, but there is a large number of people who want to defend their region from the Armed Forces of Ukraine""
[...]
The liberation of the entire territory of the region from the Ukrainian army depends on the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. ""Our own strengths will never be enough,"" Balitki emphasized.
During the special operation, the Russian army took control over the Kherson region and the Azov region of the Zaporozhye region in southern Ukraine. Military-civilian administrations were formed in the regions, Russian television and radio stations began to be broadcast, and commercial relations with Crimea are restored. The regions intend to become part of Russia.
[...]
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the armed forces are only hitting the military infrastructure and Ukrainian troops, and starting with March 25 they have fulfilled the main tasks of the first stage - they have significantly reduced Ukraine's fighting potential. According to the Russian military department, the main goal is the liberation of the Donbass region"".
NARRATIVE: Volunteers from Zaporizhia join a battalion that will defend the region from the Ukrainian army.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The city of Zaporizhia is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the region with the same name is coordinated by the Regional State Military Administration. So, in the city of Zaporozhye, which is under the control of the Ukrainian army, civil defense battalions cannot defend themselves against government military forces.
The occupation bodies, cited by the pro-Kremlin media, do not represent the Zaporizhia regional authorities and do not have the right to speak on behalf of all residents. On the website of the Zaporizhia Regional State Military Administration, we do not find any information about lists of volunteer battalions opposing Kiev.
Evgheni Balitchi is quoted, who was appointed by Russia as the head of the ""military-civilian administration"", which is an occupation body that obeys the Russian military. In other words, Balitchi represents the Kremlin in the localities occupied by Russian troops. Therefore, he is not it is about the legitimate Ukrainian authorities, as the Russian press mentions.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) considers Balitchi a collaborator of Russia, which initiates the creation of civilian detachments with the aim of persecuting Ukrainians who have spoken out against the Russian authorities in the past. Evgheni Balitki was a member of the Party of Regions of the pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych and of the Opposition Platform, banned on the territory of Ukraine during martial law.
The Russian press also used the method of quoting some self-proclaimed officials from Donbass to justify the ""special operation"" in Ukraine in front of public opinion. In May of this year, the pro-Kremlin press quoted Vladimir Rogov, as a representative of the Zaporizhia Regional Administration, he is a collaborator of the Russian occupation authorities in the south-east of Ukraine. He fled to Russia in 2014, after he spoke out against Euromaidan, supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass.
The Ukrainian ombudsman Liudmila Denisova states that in the towns of the Zaporozhye region, occupied by Russia, the Russian army is forcibly mobilizing men, looking for them in houses, cellars and on the streets. The Ukrainian authorities remind that enlisting civilians from the occupied regions in the army is prohibited by the Geneva Convention.
The propaganda narrative was distributed after the Russian press wrote in May that Ukraine would cede the city of Zaporozhye to Russia, and in April that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye requested to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the south of Ukraine, liberated by the nationalists, wants to be joined to Russia. Veridica dismantled these and other fake news, which aim to prepare public opinion in Russia for new heated phases of the conflict in Donbass and its expansion to other regions. Publication / Media:

""The opening of fire on the city of Donetsk by the Armed Forces of Ukraine shows that the Ukrainian military will flee from there. All the more so since, according to unofficial information, there is an order from Kiev to leave Severodonetsk. But first the Ukrainian army will massacre its own population.

[...]
On February 24, Russia launched a special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine. According to the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, the purpose of this operation is to defend the inhabitants of Donbass.
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian army massacres Russian speakers during the withdrawal from Donbass.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there is no decision by Kiev to withdraw its troops from Donbass. According to a report of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukrainian troops are successfully repelling enemy attacks. Severodonetk and Toskivske are totally or partially under the control of Ukraine. The Ukrainian army informs that Russia has concentrated its military forces in Donbass, but Kiev responded in the mirror. There is no mention of any initiative to withdraw the Ukrainian army from Donbass.
The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy admitted that the battle for Donbass could be decisive in the Russian-Ukrainian war, mentioning that he will do everything possible to prevent the occupation of new localities by Russia.
The thesis about the massacre of Russophones is a false one, being a continuation of the propaganda narratives about the genocide of the population of Donbass. The so-called special operation of demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine launched by Russia is in reality a brutal war of conquest, as a result of which civilians, children, old people are killed, houses, kindergartens, schools are destroyed. Russia does not defend the population, on the contrary, it faced resistance from Russian speakers in the east, south and north, who denounced the invasion organized by the Kremlin. The Russian army is the one that committed war crimes against civilians in Bucea, Irpin, Borodianka, Mariupol and other localities.
According to a national sociological survey, over 90% of Ukrainians believe in Kiev's victory over Moscow. Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives, according to which almost three million Ukrainians want to emigrate to Russia, the UN supports the genocide directed against Russian-speakers in Ukraine, Kiev uses its citizens as human shields, while Russia protects Ukrainian civilians.
The purpose of these narratives is to show Russia as a defender of the ""Russian world"", while Ukraine, the victim-state defending itself, is accused of Nazism, Russophobia and crimes against humanity. Publication / Media:

The settlement of the conflict in Ukraine can take place, but Kiev will probably have to make certain concessions, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during the meeting with the President of Finland Sauli Niinisto.
""Peace in Ukraine is possible. It depends on its price. How much territory, how much independence, how much freedom, how much democracy is willing to pay for peace. It's a complicated moral dilemma,"" Stoltenberg said.
According to the general secretary of the Alliance, only the Ukrainian residents must decide in which way peace will be achieved"", notes RTVI.
""Stoltenberg stated that without territorial concessions on the part of Ukraine, peace will not be possible, and NATO will help Kiev pay the lowest price for peace,"" Komsomolksa Pravda newspaper writes.
NARRATIVE: The Secretary General of NATO proposes to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg did not say that, in order to make peace, Ukraine must cede territories. During the meeting with the president of Finland, Stoltenberg said that the highest price of freedom is paid by the Ukrainians, adding that peace can be achieved through Putin's decision to stop the absurd war. The Secretary General of NATO did not propose to Kiev to cede certain territories to Russia in the name of peace. Nowhere in Stoltenberg's speech do we find such a quote. His words were taken out of context and intentionally misrepresented to create the impression in the Russian-speaking information space that NATO would recognize Russia's territorial claims against Ukraine as legitimate.
Jens Stoltenberg did not declare that NATO will help Kiev to pay the lowest price for peace, but mentioned that ""it will support Ukraine so that its negotiating position is as strong as possible"".
The NATO Secretary General referred not to the moral dilemma of the Ukrainians regarding the territorial cessions, but to the dilemma of the Ukrainian fighters: ""We pay a price. We help and we see the economic consequences of the sanctions, but without a doubt, the Ukrainians pay the highest price [...] You must not forget every morning, day or hour that only one person, one people, is to blame. by Putin"".
Stoltenberg did not ask Kiev to cede territories to Russia, but analyzed the negotiation process, which depends on military actions: ""It is not a question of whether peace is possible. The question would be what price are you willing to pay for it. How much territory, how much independence, how much sovereignty, how much freedom, how much democracy are you willing to sacrifice for peace. It is a complicated moral dilemma that will only be resolved by those who pay the highest price. Our obligation is to support them"".
Therefore, Stoltenberg referred to the Ukrainian military, which, in order not to cede territories and not lose the country's sovereignty, is fighting with Russia, and only Kiev can decide when it should stop and if it should. In fact, Stoltenberg's message is the opposite of the one intentionally wrongly presented by the pro-Kremlin press to convince the public opinion that Russia is recording remarkable successes during the ""special military operation"" and that NATO is slowly beginning to recognize this reality.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media regarding territorial cessions, according to which Ukraine is not rebuilding Kharkov because it knows that it will join Russia, Kiev will cede the city of Zaporozhye to Russia, while 95% of Ukrainians expect to be freed from Russia. These propaganda narratives indicate informational preparations in Russia for a possible annexation of new Ukrainian territories. Publication / Media:

A teacher from Siberia defies Moscow's censorship
rferl.org / June 8, 2022
Preoccupied with convincing the rest of the world of the justice of the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian propaganda machine still fails internally. Serghei Chernasev, the director of a high school in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, resigned after refusing to sanction the students who protested against the war.
Serghei Chernasev, former high school principal in Novosibirsk:
I have a child who will grow up and ask me: ""What did you do during the war?"" I want to be able to tell him that I did something, that I did my job and expressed my opinion.
Cernasev told the journalists from Free Europe that after the protests in March, the authorities blamed him for not properly educating his students and summoned him to expel some of them.
Obviously, I didn't punish them. Why should I punish them? What were they guilty of? Anyway, the government fined them. And there were no criminal charges. (...) What idea do they want to convey to young people with such punishments? The idea that they cannot express their opinion about the war? What exactly is forbidden to them?
Left without a job, Cernasev says he will establish a new college.
I am not leaving Russia because I feel responsible. I have 1,200 students. It is my personal and moral choice. It is a fundamental principle for every human being: not to be on the side of evil under any circumstances.
Agricultural robbery in Ukraine confirmed by satellite
france24.com / June 8, 2022
Although Kremlin officials vehemently deny accusations of grain theft and export from Ukraine, the satellite images presented by France 24 journalists document at least three situations in which a Russian ship left Ukrainian ports loaded with grain. At the end of last month, the bulk carrier Matroz Poznaci was loading in the berth of the port of Sevastopol in occupied Crimea. A few days later, satellites that monitor naval traffic showed the same vessel heading towards the Lebanese port of Beirut, only to be spotted docked for unloading in Latackia, Syria. Matroz Poznaci was recorded several times crossing the Bosphorus Strait by a Turkish observer, user of social networks. Kiev estimates that the Russians removed over 400,000 tons of grain from Ukraine. Another allegation consistently denied by Moscow officials is proving to be just as justified: satellite and ground footage prove the Russian military's deliberate attacks on Ukrainian agricultural infrastructure, be it grain silos, food warehouses or dairy factories . The images also capture the theft of agricultural machinery by the Russians: a convoy of tractors and combines filmed near Melitopol has meanwhile arrived in Chechnya, as indicated by the GPS devices of the machinery that became the spoils of war.
""Russophobia"" - the new trick of Kremlin propaganda
euvsdisinfo.eu / June 9, 2022
Hate speech has never been absent from the Kremlin's propaganda, and Moscow officials' attempts to justify the invasion of Ukraine have provided seemingly unparalleled examples. And yet, Dmitri Medvedev - former president and prime minister of the Russian Federation, once known as a moderate man - managed to surprise with a recent post on his Telegram account. The current vice-president of the Security Council of Russia wrote that, as long as he lives, he will do everything in his power to make Ukraine and Ukrainians disappear from the face of the Earth. An unequivocal incitement to genocide, worthy of the increasingly thick record of the horrors of the Russian invaders, who - according to the saying ""thief calls thief"" - move with grotesque ease from calling for the eradication of a nation to the international awareness campaign, #StopHatingRussians / Stop hating the Russians"". A new video crafted in the Kremlin's propaganda workshops accuses Western countries of trying to annihilate Russian culture. Analysts from euvsdisinfo note that it is not the first time that disinformation promoted by Moscow invokes the false argument of Russophobia as an explanation for criticism from the West. This time, however, the so-called campaign seems to be coordinated at least on Twitter, where Russian diplomatic accounts, including that of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are actively involved for an illusory increase in credibility. Illusory because the respective accounts were discredited by the persistent promotion of the Kremlin's lies about the war in Ukraine and the administrators of the Twitter platform limited their activity. Consequently, the traders of the ""Russophobia"" theory reoriented themselves and resorted to other methods to create legitimacy. One of them is the distribution of the clip on fake accounts, opened in the name of honorable publications from the West.
The lie of mobilizing all Ukrainians in the war
romaniatv.net / June 12 2022, military.pravda.ru / June 11 2022, ukrinform.net / June 12 2022
Several publications from Romania rushed on Sunday to take up the news of the mobilization of women in Ukraine, published by the Russian newspaper Pravda. The information, largely ignored by the Western press, but also by the big press agencies controlled by the Kremlin, cites Boris Rojin, an analyst of the Center for Political-Military Journalism in Russia, according to which Serghei Saptal, the head of the General Staff of Ukraine, would have ordered the recruitment centers to prepare the list of Ukrainians between 18 and 60 years old who would be enlisted from today until the end of the month, erroneously indicated as ""June 31"". The explanation for the mobilization would have been ""uninterrupted recruitment"" of the military force"". The same news, persistently distributed on Telegram accounts, claimed that the military and civil administrations of Dnepropetrovsk, Kiev, Kirovograd, Nikolaev, Odesa and Kharkiv had been ordered to organize additional accommodation and military training centers for mobilized women. The Center for Combating Disinformation in Ukraine immediately denied both the information and the existence of the invoked document, qualifying them as forgeries intended for the pro-Russian audience with the aim of ""creating social instability in certain regions of Ukraine"".

The narrative is part of a real campaign on this topic, behind which are both the pro-Kremlin press and left-wing politicians from Chisinau.
NEWS: ""The West has left to take the last step to draw the Republic of Moldova into the military conflict,"" headlined the ehomd.info portal on June 7.
[...] ""There is no longer any doubt that the Republic of Moldova is being called to war with all its might. The government's propaganda works in this direction, which conveys daily that the Republic of Moldova is next after Ukraine. This is demonstrated by Maia Sandu's continuous statements regarding the need to evacuate the Russian peacekeeping contingent from Transnistria, which is there in accordance with the signed agreements. In addition, the influence of neighboring Romania, which organizes meetings of the parliaments and which sees our republic as a component part of ""Greater Bessarabia"", should not be underestimated either.
The authors of the public article and the scenario of the ""opening operation of the second front"": the NATO statement about the preparation of the Russian invasion of Transnistria; the dissemination of alleged plans of Russia to transfer its troops to Transnistria through the Odessa region and the provision of military support to the Republic of Moldova
[...] ""Actually, now, the West has to take the last step to draw the republic into the military conflict - to launch a real or fake attack on the Russian peacekeepers in Transnistria. In this case, Russia will be forced to react in accordance with its national interests and ensuring its own security"".
NARRATIVES: 1. The West is putting pressure to involve the Republic of Moldova in the war in Ukraine. 2. The Republic of Moldova is being prepared by the West to attack the Transnistrian separatist region and the Russian military stationed there.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The narratives regarding the preparations for the involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the war in Ukraine have been promoted more and more in the last month, against the background of some incidents that took place in Transnistria, but also with the statements of the Ukrainian presidential adviser Alexei Arestovici, who said that Ukraine could eliminate the separatist administration of the region ""in two times and three moves"". These were fueled by the recent statements of some British and American officials, who said that they would be ready to support the Republic of Moldova with weapons. weaponry to increase military resilience.
OBJECTIVE: To fuel the Kremlin's propaganda that Russia is surrounded by enemies and is forced to fight a war for survival; to cause panic in the Republic of Moldova, but also criticism of the current pro-European authorities.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: First, the Kremlin's tendency to confuse the Russian peacekeepers with the Russian military forces present in Transnistria must be mentioned. The so-called peacekeepers are part of the Peacekeeping Mission formed in 1992, following the ceasefire agreement signed by Chisinau and Moscow after the military conflict on the Dniester. When the representatives of Chisinau demand the evacuation of Russian troops, they are referring to the contingent of approximately 1,500 soldiers who officially guard the weapons depot in Cobasna with Soviet-era weaponry that Russia officially assumed, back in the late 90s, to evacuate . Russian propaganda intentionally does not distinguish between these two categories of military forces in order to induce the idea that the Republic of Moldova wants to destroy the peacekeeping forces on the Dniester, which could cause a new conflict with the separatist forces. However, several experts dispute the role of this mission.
The plans to attack the separatist region by the forces of Chisinau, at the command/with the support of the West, have no logic in the conditions in which representatives of Kiev, who consider the region as a possible risk factor, even if small, considering its military potential , expressed their willingness to ""cleanse"" it of separatists and Russian forces ""as soon as you snap your fingers"". A scenario of the regulation of the Transnistrian conflict following a military intervention is excluded by the Chisinau authorities, who continue to insist on negotiations.
So, if the West would influence the authorities in Chisinau as the authors of the comment claim, they should not even make efforts to attack Transnistria, because this could be done by Ukraine, without requiring any military/economic effort from the West .
Even if Ukraine showed itself ready to intervene in Transnistria, the opening of a new front would mean that it must mobilize the necessary resources for it in other areas of the country. In addition, the proximity of the fighting to the borders of Romania, a NATO member state, would increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO, which the North Atlantic Alliance, as it declares, does not want. In addition, the military expenses of the West would increase. The Republic of Moldova has a military budget of less than 40 million euros, Soviet armament, no tanks, fleet and anti-aircraft defense, so with minimal military potential.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: There were statements by some Western officials, as well as from Chisinau, they made statements about the need to increase the military resilience of the Republic of Moldova. Publication / Media:

In reality, the Chinese delegation listened carefully the speech of the Ukrainian leader and did not leave the conference hall.
NEWS: The Chinese delegation left the hall during the speech of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Shangri La Dialogue security summit in Singapore, said the senior analyst of the US Asian Research Center, Olivia Enos.
""Zelenski is speaking at the Shangri La Dialogue 2022. The Chinese delegation has left the room,"" Enos wrote on Twitter (the network is blocked in the Russian Federation).
On the territory of Ukraine, a special Russian operation of denazification and demilitarization of the state is taking place. The President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, emphasized that the main goal of the operation is the liberation of the DNR and LNR territories. Chinese citizens have repeatedly expressed their admiration for Russia's resistance to the pressure caused by the sanctions of the western states.
NARRATIVE: The Chinese delegation left the hall during Zelenski's speech at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: After Russia invaded Ukraine, on February 24, Moscow presented its military actions as a ""special operation"" to denazify the Ukrainian state. The Russian press writes that the special operation is supported by China (but also other states ), despite the fact that Beijing did not have a clear public position.
OBJECTIVE: To convince public opinion in Russia and the former Soviet states that Moscow's actions in Ukraine are correct and supported by China.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: The Russian press cites a Twitter account, despite the fact that this network has even been classified in Russia as one of fake news.
According to the Center for Strategic Communication and Informational Security of Ukraine, no delegation left the conference room when President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke. The Center quotes a participant at the conference, who stated that no one was allowed to leave the room and mentions that the senior analyst of the US Asian Research Center, Olivia Enos, deleted the post from Twitter.
The video recording of Volodymyr Zelensky's message and the discussions with the leader from Kiev is 28 minutes long. It can be clearly seen that during Zelenski's speech, no one left the hall. Therefore, the pro-Kremlin press is lying when it reports about the protest of the Chinese delegation to Ukraine.
The Russian press manipulates public opinion and when it writes that Beijing expresses its admiration for Russia regarding its resistance to sanctions; in fact, Ura.ru refers to some comments on a regional blog, not to any official position of the authorities. Publication / Media:

The narratives were launched by former president Igor Dodon and amplified by the socialist and Russian media.
NEWS: Igor Dodon: ,,[...] Against the background of these economic and energy crises, from which the PAS government cannot get out, due to its incompetence, we are informed that lethal weapons and possibly foreign troops will be brought to Moldova. I mean, in winter we will live in poverty and cold, but with cannons and rockets.
It is very clear that Maia Sandu and her masters from outside are following the Ukrainian scenario, provoking the intentional destabilization of the situation, and some political factors in the West want to use the Moldovans as cannon fodder in the geopolitical struggle that is now taking place in this region. In fact, all these arming processes and this anti-Russian hysteria are done specifically to justify the presence of foreign NATO troops on the territory of the Republic of Moldova. A military and political connection of our country to the territory of Romania is being prepared, with the renunciation of neutrality. Without consulting the opinion of the citizens and contrary to the constitutional norms, a technical, political-military Union is being prepared, which they will later try to formalize and legally legalize by the majority PAS Parliament and the captured Constitutional Court, under the ""protection"" of the foreign troops present here , as it was in the history of our people at the beginning of the last century. [...]
I am personally convinced that sooner or later I will join the revolted people and the protests that are inevitable. I will help as I can. If I and the socialists had been in charge, such chaos and such economic degradation would not have happened. We would have managed all the risks in economy, medicine and energy much more professionally, more diplomatically and more responsibly. And no military danger would have threatened us as a country.
But now we have what we have - bad times. And we have to fight to return to normality. I am convinced that people will choose to fight for the future of the country and the children, not to passively die of cold and poverty"", wrote Igor Dodon on social networks. NARRATIVES: 1. Lethal weapons and NATO troops will be brought to the Republic of Moldova. 2. Maia Sandu and her masters from outside follow the Ukrainian scenario, and the Moldovans will be used by the West as cannon fodder in the geopolitical struggle. 3. A military and political connection is being prepared on the territory of Romania, with the renunciation of neutrality. 4. The people are outraged and protests are uncalled for. 5. If the socialists were in government, the Republic of Moldova would not have been threatened by any military risk.
CONTEXT: The war in Ukraine and the increase in the prices of energy resources on the international markets have economically affected the Republic of Moldova, which is currently facing high inflation, which exceeded 29% in May, and an increase in prices of over 17% year to date.
At the same time, the risks of military escalation in the Transnistrian separatist region, where Russian troops are present that could be involved in the war in Ukraine, but also of political destabilization in Chisinau, with the involvement of the pro-Russian party, remain high. In this context, the government recognized that the national army is poorly equipped and began to talk about the need to modernize and equip it accordingly.
At the meeting of the PSRM Republican Council on June 4, the Socialist Party announced that it would initiate the dismissal of the PAS Government, which it described as ""useless and harmful"". The Socialists called the population to protests and tried to organize demonstrations in some localities, but the reaction of the citizens to the calls of the PSRM is a passive one. Even in the Parliament, the group of socialists and communists does not have the necessary number of votes to dismiss the Government.
The former pro-Russian president, Igor Dodon, is under criminal investigation in a case of corruption, illegal financing of the party, illicit enrichment, but also treason. He was detained at the end of last month and is under house arrest.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to destabilize the situation in the Republic of Moldova, which is seriously affected by the war in Ukraine. At the same time, Igor Dodon, who is a pro-Russian politician, is trying with these statements to regain the Kremlin's trust, after his party lost the government in the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The authorities in Chisinau talked about the need to modernize the National Army, but they only referred to non-lethal defense equipment, given that the defense sector has been neglected and needs investment. There is no NATO contingent on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, and Chisinau has not made any attempt to join the North Atlantic Alliance. Part of the territory of the Republic of Moldova is de facto controlled by a separatist regime, militarily supported by Moscow. The Russian troops illegally located on the left bank of the Dniester violate the state of neutrality of the Republic of Moldova, to which Igor Dodon refers. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the Chisinau authorities have always invoked this provision of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova and have not made any declaration regarding the renunciation of the neutrality status.
The narratives regarding the West that wants to draw Moldova into a geopolitical fight against Russia are part of the Kremlin's war propaganda. The Republic of Moldova, which is a small state, does not have the military and human potential to get involved in a war, and Chisinau does not even have defense capabilities in the event that it would be the target of an attack, even from the Transnistrian region.
Regarding the declarations regarding the union with Romania, although there are followers of the union in the Republic of Moldova, they represent a minority and there is no unionist force in the Chisinau Parliament. The myth about the intention of the government led by Maia Sandu to unite with Romania is intensively promoted by the media affiliated to the Socialist Party.
Igor Dodon's statements were also taken over by the official press from Moscow. On the other hand, the Kremlin claims that it does not have detailed information regarding the plans to unite the Republic of Moldova with Romania.
Regarding Igor Dodon's statements about the revolted people and the inevitable protests, it is natural that price increases cause social discontent, but so far there has been no massive anti-government protest, but some actions organized by socialists and the Sor Party, in which a number of insignificant number of representatives and supporters of these political formations. The increase in prices and the energy crisis is a consequence of the situation on the international markets. At the same time, the total energy dependence of the Republic of Moldova on the Russian Federation is a consequence of the policies promoted by the previous governments, including the socialist and communist ones, as well as the economic model based on consumer products, mostly imported.

In reality, the American experts want to find out if Moscow used chips and other components produced in the USA and the EU for the production of the respective weaponry, bypassing the sanctions introduced since 2014.
NEWS: ""Expert Leonkov declared that the Russian equipment captured in Ukraine will surprise the Pentagon. The Russian armed forces use high-performance combat equipment, but not the most modern ones in the special operation in Ukraine, because from the very beginning it was taken into account that Western experts would study them in detail, military expert Aleksei Leonkov commented for Life.
""I simply did not know that they would study us so carefully that they would even transmit this information to the Ukrainian side. Of course, Kiev got something in the first weeks of the special operation as a trophy. The military equipment with which we participated is not the most modern, but quite effective to carry out combat operations"", said Leonkov. [...] Therefore, Leonkov is sure that the West and Kiev ""have not taken root, but only by the tops"".
We remind you that The New York Times reported that the Pentagon studied the Russian military equipment captured by the Ukrainian security forces and the fragments of the Kinjal missile. It is assumed that parts of the hypersonic weapons of the Russian Federation were studied as part of the collection of data on Moscow's achievements in the technical-military field"".
NARRATIVE: The US is studying Russian weapons captured in Ukraine in order to copy its ultra-modern technology.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The narrative in the Russian media starts from an article published by The New York Times according to which American experts arrived in Ukraine at the invitation of the Security Service in Kiev to analyze how Russia uses advanced Western technologies, in especially the chips, for the production of the weaponry with which Moscow hits military and civilian targets on Ukrainian territory.
It should be noted that, starting in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea and the launch of the conflict in Donbass, the USA and the EU introduced sanctions against Russia, which primarily provide for the partial ban of exports to Russia of electronic components and chips that are used for the production of weapons. After the outbreak of Russia's war against Ukraine on February 24, an export embargo on semiconductors, computers, chips, etc. was introduced. to create difficulties for Russia regarding the production of modern weapons. The US has declared that it will carry out in-depth research in order to find out how Western technologies end up in the hands of Russia, bypassing the embargo.
Therefore, the purpose of the visit to Ukraine by the military experts was not to ""copy ultra-modern Russian technology"", but to find out if electronic chips from the West reach Russia - basically, to find out how Russia builds its weapons with the help of Western technology The New York Times, quoted by the Russian press, writes that the experts identified American electronic chips in the captured weaponry, but all marking and description elements of these technological components were removed. For now, it is not known how these technologies arrived in Russia.
The Russian press does not remember anything about these conclusions of the American publication, but promoted a false narrative about the desire of the US to copy Russia's high-performance military technology, with the help of which Moscow would record great successes in the ""special operation"".
The purpose of the narrative is to strengthen the confidence of Russian citizens in the armed forces and in the Kremlin, which would have the most modern and efficient weaponry in the world, ""hunted by the American services"". These propaganda messages are a continuation of the narratives from the USSR period, according to which the American spies were on the territory of the Soviet republics and were looking for the secret schemes of ultra-modern military technologies that were not found in the USA; however, history has shown that in reality the USSR was technologically surpassed by the West.

This resumes the theses of Moscow's propaganda that tries to justify its aggression against Ukraine by accusing the West of being guilty of the conflict.
NEWS: ""The West has come to be seen as a high-cost economy, with housing, education and medical expenses financed today exclusively by debt (merciless bank loans, see what ex-prime minister Florin Citu did to Romania!).
But for Western financial capitalism, even this way of governing has a flaw, in the end: how can it maintain the standard of living in the face of deindustrialization and debt deflation by impoverishing 99% of the people to enrich the 1%?
Well, the Americans have been able to do that, at least until now. After the start of the war in Ukraine, the first objective of the USA observed by world economists was to discourage Europe and Japan from cooperating economically with the Russian Federation and even the entire Eurasian area. And, in order to keep the EU and Japan simple satellite economies, the Americans took care to build a new Berlin wall, but this time an economic one. The goal achieved: trade between East and West was completely blocked! Sanctions against Russia have the effect of affecting the trade balance of European countries through the sudden increase in oil, gas and food prices (as well as prices for many metals). All these goods must now be imported and from where else if not from the USA, who followed this?! [...] In Germany, the engine of the EU, the Minister of Economy, Robert Habeck (Green Party), talks about activating the country's gas reserves in order not to bankrupt the industries! And Germany also ended up begging for such resources from the monarchies of the Emirates, from where, however, it received an elegant refusal. Even on the ropes, however, the Germans keep insisting that they put a cross on the North Stream II gas pipeline and they are proud of it.
In fact, in reality, nothing else happened except that the USA asked Germany to commit economic suicide and cause a depression in society - higher prices for consumer goods and lower living standards for the population! All these shortages for the EU represent, in the mirror, a huge benefit for the United States, which makes enormous profits by selling the Europeans more expensive oil [...] Europe today looks like the big loser of the US-Russia proxy war. It seems that we, the Europeans, have become a kind of appendage of the American economy, and the logical consequence would be to politically join the United States, renouncing the national governments [...] Brussels does not seem to see that it is the victim of this new economic war unleashed by America for energy, food and financial domination"". NARRATIVES: 1. The USA turns the EU into its colony, after the war in Ukraine started 2. The USA is waging a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine for world domination. 3. Middle Eastern countries refused to sell hydrocarbons to Germany to replace imports from Russia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The war in Ukraine has a direct impact on the European Union, which imports about 40% of the gas needed for industry and heating the population, as well as 25% of oil, from the Russian Federation.
Since the beginning of the invasion in Ukraine, taking advantage of the war situation and the increase in gas and oil prices on the international markets, Russia obtains huge profits, much higher than on February 24, a fact that allows it to finance the war and maintain its economy above the waterline, especially as it depends on the massive exports of hydrocarbons.
The EU has so far adopted six packages of economic sanctions in response to Russia's unprovoked aggression in Ukraine; the sixth includes a staged embargo on Russian oil exports. The sanctions are intended both to punish Russia and to diminish its ability to wage this war.
The United States adopted its own sanctions against Russia, including an embargo on imports of oil and oil products, which were, however, much smaller than the European ones.
OBJECTIVE: Shifting the responsibility for starting the war from Russia, as the aggressor state that invaded Ukraine, to the USA.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: First of all, it is based on the already classic narrative of Russian propaganda, which says that the USA actually initiated the war in Ukraine through all kinds of machinations. According to this Kremlin narrative, the US would wage a proxy war in Ukraine against Russia.
Obviously, the USA did not start the war in Ukraine, but this is the result of the massive Russian invasion on the territory of Ukraine on February 24. In fact, almost a year before, Russia constantly and quantitatively massed more army and military equipment at the borders of Ukraine under the pretext of military exercises. Russia consistently denied any invasion plan until the last day before the February 24 moment.
Economically, Russia created and contributed to the artificial increase in natural gas prices long before the invasion of Ukraine, throughout 2021.
Russia reduced its exports to Europe by 25% in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, which accentuated the increase in gas prices on the Spot market in Europe.
Revenues from oil and gas export taxes and tariffs accounted for 45% of Russia's federal budget in January 2022. Considering current market prices, the value of Russian pipeline gas exports to the EU alone amounts to 400 million dollars a day. Total revenues from the export of crude oil and refined products currently amount to approximately 700 million US dollars per day.
The amount of Russian oil and gas entering Europe has actually increased since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Europe paid Russia around 22 billion euros ($24 billion) for oil and gas in March alone, according to Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank, quoted by Nature magazine.
Therefore, Russia takes full advantage of the high oil and gas prices.
Russia's problem with the USA is also one of direct competition. In numbers, Russia is the second largest gas producer in the world, after the United States. Russia produced 761 billion cubic meters of gas in 2021, or 18% of world gas production.
Russia is the largest gas exporter in the world, with exports worth about 250 billion cubic meters in 2021, 210 billion cubic meters passing through pipelines, the rest being transported in liquefied form, according to IEA data.
The USA is trying to offer Europeans an alternative to Russian gas by exporting liquefied gas to the EU. .
In April, US producers exported nearly 50 million barrels of crude to European buyers from the main terminals in Texas and Louisiana, according to ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. That's nearly half of what was sent abroad last month from the Gulf Coast, the main US export hub.
The European Commission has launched plans to reduce Russian gas imports by approximately two-thirds by the end of the year. This strategy is largely based on increasing natural gas imports from abroad, and it is not clear if all member states will follow this plan. At the same time, in recent years, the EU has also engaged in an effort to transition to a green economy, in order to combat climate change, and this also implies shifting the focus to so-called green energy.
Regarding Germany, the author of the article is clearly lying, stating that Germany was ""elegantly rejected"". Middle Eastern countries rich in hydrocarbons such as Saudi Arabia or Qatar are also strong competitors of Russia on this market.
In fact, Germany announced at the end of March that it reached an agreement with Qatar for the supply of energy. After a meeting with the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, the German Minister of Economy, Robert Habeck, said that he found more support than expected. ""Even if we might still need Russian gas this year, in the future it won't be like that anymore. And this is just the beginning,"" said the German official who specified that the two states will collaborate on several levels.
The decision to stop the Nord Stream II gas pipeline is a sovereign decision of Germany, taken in response to the war. Like other Western countries, Germany has been very vocal against Russia stopping the war in Ukraine and is acting accordingly. The United States at one point opposed the construction of the gas pipeline, which did not prevent Germany from going further; moreover, Washington had allowed himself to be persuaded to give up most of his objections.

Fake ""Pfizer treatment"" to halve the population
politifact.com / June 1, 2022
A message attributed to the president of the Pfizer company, with a scandalous but untrue content, proves that the naivety of some of the users of social networks keeps pace with the unscrupulous creators of online forgeries. The clip in which Albert Bourla seems to say in a recent debate at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the goal of his drug company is to halve the world's population by next year has been redistributed thousands of times, including by Romanian users. The American site politifact.com, specialized in verifying and dismantling forgeries, classified the mystification in the extreme category, that is - in a decent Romanian translation - ""outrageous lies"". And this is because, as his statement proves Bourla, easily accessible on YouTube, the head of Pfizer actually said that his dream is for the company he leads to reduce by 50% in one year the number of people who, due to poverty, do not have access to medicines. By simply removing the keywords reached a message that in just a few hours gathered over 50,000 views on the British platform bitchute.com, known as promoters of conspiracy theories.
Global warming and amateur challengers
factcheck.afp.com / June 3, 2022
Last month's meeting of the Economic Forum gave rise to misinformation widely distributed on social networks. ""The ice sheet in the Arctic area has reached the highest level in the last 30 years"" - the author of an article taken from the WND website says with satisfaction, giving a thumbs up to the ""alarmist globalists"" who claim that the emissions of carbon leads to the melting of the ice sheets. The article, reproduced by several sites and with thousands of views on Twitter and Reddit, invokes measurements by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites to accuse the participants of the Davos Forum of using false pretexts, such as global warming and the pandemic, in the goal of the global redistribution of wealth. Agence France Presse discovered that the misinformation started from the superficial interpretation of some real scientific data by Tony Heller - an old opponent of climate problems. The Norwegian expert Thomas Lavergne explained that, despite the annual variations in the volume of ice in the Arctic waters, the decline measured in a 30-year interval is constant. Thus, starting from 1980, the ice layer decreases by 2.5% every decade.
100 days of ""fog"" on Kremlin televisions
aljazeera.com / June 4, 2022
On the 100th anniversary of the war in Ukraine, a documentary broadcast by the Al Jazeera television channel proposes a return in time starting with March 1, when the Russian army struck the television tower in Kiev, thus stopping the broadcast of several TV channels local. An attack with an apparently minor stake in an informational war waged today rather on digital fronts than on radio waves. And yet, although television is no longer as important as it once was, its control is crucial in Vladimir Putin's Russia. The Kremlin has forbidden the Russian media to use the word ""war"" in references to the conflict in Ukraine. Any violation of the order proves fatal for the publication that insists on respecting the vocabulary and the truth. When the independent television channel Dojd - ""Ploaia"" in Romanian - used the illegal word ""invasion"", like the Echo Moskvi radio station, the General Prosecutor's Office ordered the closure of the two stations, tolerated until then despite their critical position towards the Kremlin. Al Jazeera spoke to the television news director Dojd Ekaterina Kotricadze twice: The first time in February, in one of the station's studios; the second time, ten days after the invasion of Ukraine, in a location kept secret for fear of reprisals by the Russian services against the journalist.
EKATERINA KOTRICADZE, News director and Dojd TV presenter (February 14, Moscow)
 ""It all started in 2014, when the popularity of our television became so great that the government understood that it had to do something. We have millions of viewers and journalists and presenters from Dojd TV are very popular in Russia. Dojd is the only liberal, ""live"" television channel, where topics prohibited on other stations are debated. After the Revolution (in Ukraine), the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, Dojd has become a problem for the government.""
(March 5, secret location)
""We were forced to leave Russia because of the unbearable situation. We had to deal with military censorship, we faced all kinds of worrying signals coming from different sources. So we no longer have any confidence in (the authorities in) Russia. Also, I and some of my colleagues received threats from various people, messages, terrible things, the Dojd website was blocked... For me, it was the decisive argument that convinced me that we have no chance to survive in the country. So I left. I am convinced that something will happen and that Dojd TV will return in one form or another, just as I am sure that this is not the end.
For Vladimir Putin, the silencing of the independent press is only a part - the most accessible - of the blockade imposed on the correct information of the population. Meanwhile, the Kremlin continues its informational war with its own citizens in the street, where law enforcement, equipped as for combat, seize the mobile phones of passers-by in Moscow's Lubyanka market to rummage through digital data, from the contact list to the content accessed on social networks. The identification of any indication of opposition to the official line regarding Ukraine is punishable, according to the law, with prison.

254,757,Children in Donbass were sold for organs under the coordination of the Red Cross,children from donbass were sold for organs under the coordination of the red cross,False,[],['the Red Cross'],,,,,,,https://tsargrad.tv/news/krasnyj-krest-obvinili-v-torgovle-organami-deti-donbassa-stanovilis-zhertvami-evseev_557138/nsk,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-copiii-din-donbass-erau-vanduti-pentru-organe-sub-coordonarea-crucii-rosii,,08.06.2022,,,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-copiii-din-donbass-erau-vanduti-pentru-organe-sub-coordonarea-crucii-rosii,,"The pro-Kremlin press accuses the Red Cross of dealing in Mariupol with the trafficking of children's organs from Donbass. The false narrative aims to discredit this international organization, which was denied access to the area occupied by Russia, where it intends to get involved in the evacuation of civilians and provide medical care to the population.
NEWS: Following the investigation, hundreds of children's medical records were found at the headquarters of the Red Cross in Mariupol. Military expert Vladimir Evseev explained how and for what purposes they were used.
""Tarigrad"" previously reported that hundreds of children's medical records were found at the headquarters of the Russian Cross mission. Diseases are not indicated, only data about healthy organs appear. It was specified that all the information was entered using the Latin alphabet.
[...]
During a long period, the Ukrainian Nazis organized the transportation of human organs to Europe. At first, they contacted the relatives of the Ukrainian soldier who was on his deathbed. After they expressed their agreement, the military organ was sold, explained the expert.
After this scheme became functional, they went to the civilians of Donbass. They mainly dealt with girls and children. In fact, if Russia did not launch the special operation in Ukraine, a large part of the children in Donbass would be sold for organs. These activities were coordinated by the Red Cross, Evseev said.
NARRATIVE: Children in Donbass were sold for organs under the coordination of the Red Cross.
CONTEXT: After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) repeatedly requested Moscow to allow the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol and the provision of medical care to the population. Russia has refused each time to allow Red Cross experts to work in the area, and on several occasions has broken its ceasefire commitments to allow evacuation through humanitarian corridors. The Red Cross and the OSCE denounced the lack of cooperation shown by Russia, so that both organizations became targets of Russian propaganda.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to discredit the initiatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross to evacuate civilians in Donbass and to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Red Cross immediately reacted to the allegations by the pro-Kremlin media calling them false. ""The ICRC did not collect such data. The video also insinuates that the ICRC is involved in organ trafficking. This is another false accusation,"" according to a Red Cross press release. The ICRC emphasizes that its objectives are purely humanitarian in nature. ""We face challenges in areas affected by armed conflicts, but our work is meant to minimize suffering, nothing more. We trust that most people will recognize false claims when they see them,"" said Jason Straziuso, an ICRC spokesman.
In another ICRC report, it is said that on March 15, the experts of the International Committee mission left Mariupol. At the end of March, its headquarters in the city were bombed. Even the ""Tarigrad"" website publishes in the news about the medical files of children from the ICRC a photo of the destroyed headquarters, where everything is burned, except for ""a safe with a stack of medical files""!
The advisor to the mayor of Mariupol, Petro Andriuscenko, wrote on Telegram that the occupiers searched the headquarters of the Red Cross and found some medical records, adding: ""This is the same building destroyed by Russia.""
The Russian press does not publish any concrete evidence to prove that the files were found at the ICRC headquarters, which is in fact destroyed, that they are not medical files of the occupation authorities and that it is not a stage. In addition, the ICRC is probably the most well-known and respected international humanitarian organization, and its history and the way it has behaved throughout its almost 160 years of activity in conflict zones, show how ridiculous the accusations are they bring
The false narrative is built on the model of the news about the OSCE mission in Mariupol, accused of collaborating with the ""Azov"" regiment and of providing it with information. Veridica recently dismantled this false narrative of the Kremlin-controlled media which started a real campaign to discredit the the efforts of the OSCE to maintain peace and the Red Cross to help civilians in the area to convince the domestic public opinion that the evidence of international experts regarding Russian destabilizing actions in Donbass is false.

His statements, taken over by media institutions such as Politnavigator and Tsargrad, were rejected by the Chisinau authorities.
NEWS: ""The West is preparing to open a Moldovan front against Russia"", military correspondent Semion Pegov communicated on his telegram channel.
""According to my information, obtained from sources in Chisinau, 49 FBI collaborators arrived here, who know the Russian language, being specialized in actions to counter Russian influence. Their mission is to change the security system of the Republic of Moldova. These were transformed by Romania for many years, but now the Americans connected in an emergency mode"".
[...] The reform of the security system, in his opinion, is related to the plans to join the Republic of Moldova to Romania. In particular, a person with a Romanian passport was appointed as director of the Information and Security Service.
""In addition, 24 employees of the German espionage service are in Chisinau. They will specialize in Transnistria and probably prepare the ground for military actions. This is the direction, unfortunately,"" Pegov concluded,"" Politnavigator wrote.
""The sources from the Republic of Moldova of the popular war correspondent Semion Pegov, the author of the Wargonzo project, believe that the NATO countries have begun to deal seriously with the opening of a Moldovan front against Russia"", according to Tsargrad.
NARRATIVES: 1. Western agents ""invaded"" the Republic of Moldova. 2. The Republic of Moldova is being prepared by the West to attack the Russian Federation militarily. 3. The annexation of the Republic of Moldova by Romania is being prepared.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Facing a secessionist conflict in the East, fueled by the Russian Federation for over 30 years, but also with a political elite and part of the population (especially the national minorities, which represent approximately 20%) pro- Russian, the Republic of Moldova is considered the most vulnerable country and the first target of Moscow if it succeeds in defeating Ukraine.
Moreover, the propaganda attacks on the Republic of Moldova have intensified, emphasizing the messages about the supposed control of the country by the West, the violation of the rights of Russian-speaking national minorities, the violation of the country's neutral status by the pro-European government and the West, etc.
OBJECTIVE: To show the Republic of Moldova as a state that represents a potential danger for the Russian Federation. To inoculate the idea that the Republic of Moldova is governed from the outside and ""crooked"" by foreign agents from states hostile to the Russian Federation. To revive the old topic about the imminent annexation of the Republic of Moldova by Romania, which represents a ""mortal"" danger for minorities .
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The information about the alleged landing of FBI agents in Chisinau, but also about German secret agents, is based on the statements of the author of the Telegram channel Wargonzo, the controversial Russian journalist, author of a film about the conflict in eastern Ukraine, blocked by YouTube , Semyon Pegov. He, in turn, refers to ""sources from Chisinau"", without presenting any proof of the veracity of the information. Politnavigator was blocked by the Chisinau authorities last fall, due to the spread of false information.
Both the press service of the General Inspectorate of the Police of the Republic of Moldova, as well as the spokeswoman of the Information and Security Service, Daniela Manzat, qualified the respective information as false, mentioning that it is based on statements published on Telegram channels that distribute false information .
The arming of the Republic of Moldova by NATO, its preparation for military confrontations with Russia, the attack on Transnistria, are other false narratives intensively promoted by some media institutions, especially from the Russian Federation.
In reality, the Republic of Moldova is too small and militarily unprepared (even if it received weapons from abroad) to count in a confrontation with Russia.
And the topic of a possible union with Romania is brought out more and more intensively in the public space to fuel the phobias of the national minorities and the separatist claims of the Tiraspol regime. In fact, both the authorities from Chisinau and those from Bucharest talk about intensifying cooperation between the two states and supporting the European path of the Republic of Moldova

The narrative is built starting from an opinion poll that doesn't even address this topic.
NEWS: 56.8% of the respondents who took part in the survey carried out by the newspaper Rzeczpospolita ""strongly support"" or ""moderately support"" the idea of ​​the participation of the Polish army in a ""pacification"" mission on the territory of Ukraine.
A few days ago, President Duda expressed his fantasies regarding the ""disappearance of the borders between Poland and Ukraine"", which represents a test of public opinion regarding the future military aggression and recovery of the ""eastern regions"" [of Poland].
Rzeczpospolita is a right-wing newspaper (traditionally journalists support the Russophobes in the ruling party, but distance themselves from them in public) and this must be taken into account. However, the popularization of militarism and aggressive rhetoric in Poland, but also in the whole of Europe, is an obvious situation.
NARRATIVE: The majority of Poles support the invasion of the western regions of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, 56.8% of Poles declared that they support any participation of Poland in a possible pacification mission on the territory of Ukraine if this mission will be organized by the EU, NATO or the UN, so it is not about any unilateral military action. The survey therefore referred to the hypothetical involvement of Poland alongside the international community in solving the crisis in Ukraine. If we carefully read the article in Rzeczpospolita in which the results of the survey are presented, we will not find any dominant narrative in the Russian press. Nothing is said about the invasion of Ukraine, about Polish territories that now belong to Ukraine, about Warsaw's military aggression, about Russophobia. All these elements absent in Rzeczpospolita constitute 90% of the information published in the Russian press and actively distributed at the beginning of June on Telegram channels in Russia.
Both the president and the prime minister of Poland have shown through concrete facts that they support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. The fantasies regarding the ""disappearance of the borders between Poland and Ukraine"" attributed to the president of Poland are in reality an initiative to establish joint control points at the border between the two states.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives by the pro-Kremlin media regarding Poland's ""interests"" in the war in Ukraine. In May, the Russian media wrote that the president of Poland admitted that Warsaw would annex Ukrainian territories after the head of Russian espionage, Sergei Nariskin, declared that Poland would take control of its ""historical territories"" in Ukraine with the help of the US.
Also in May, the Russian press accuses Ukraine in propaganda narratives of having allowed 10,000 soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country, following the distribution of false news about the high expectations of the Poles regarding the invasion of Ukraine.
Poland was the most vocal and active of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts, becoming a target of Russian propaganda. Publication / Media:

In reality, it is about several dozen experts who will support the Moldovan border police to control the border crossing and manage the flow of refugees.
NEWS: The deputy of the Bloc of Communists and Socialists, Alexandr Nesterovschi, sounds the alarm: 40% of the territory of the Republic of Moldova will be controlled by foreign and armed policemen. The statement was made during the Parliament session, where the PAS Government presented the draft law for the ratification of the Agreement between the Republic of Moldova and the European Union regarding the operational activities carried out by the European Border Police and Coast Guard Agency in the Republic of Moldova.
""According to the information presented by you, the operative actions can take place at a distance of 30 km from the border area, which means that almost 40% of the territory of the Republic of Moldova will be covered by these operative actions, armed foreigners, who do not can be criminally investigated in our country, who can do anything on our territory. How does this relate to the neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova?"", asked Nesterovschi.
""It is about 10 km enshrined in the Constitution plus 20 km if necessary which is activated under a special regime. What neutrality is about is the civilian contingent and has nothing to do with the military contingent,"" said the state secretary of the MAI, Serghei Diaconu. NARRATIVES: 1. 40% of the territory of the Republic of Moldova will be controlled by armed foreign policemen; 2. The presence of European policemen violates the neutrality of the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT: The Chisinau Parliament ratified, on Thursday, June 2, 2022, the Agreement between the Republic of Moldova and the EU regarding the operational activities carried out by FRONTEX. Thus, 80 experts of the European Agency will support the border police in managing the flow of refugees at the Moldovan-Ukrainian border.
In the context of the war in Ukraine, over 400 thousand people passed through the Republic of Moldova, and almost 100 thousand Ukrainian refugees remained on its territory. The Republic of Moldova faced for the first time such a large flow of refugees. The authorities fear that if the military operations from Ukraine reach Odessa, the refugee crisis could increase.
The agreement between the Republic of Moldova and the European Union regarding the operational activities carried out by the European Border Police and Coast Guard Agency in the Republic of Moldova was signed on March 17, 2022, in Brussels. Until now, the Moldovan authorities have collaborated with FRONTEX based on a Working Arrangement signed in 2008, which provides for the deployment of a limited number of European experts as observers.
The project sparked heated debates in Parliament, with socialist and communist deputies accusing the government that the presence of European policemen on the territory of the Republic of Moldova would violate the neutrality statute.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to accuse the West of violating the neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova and the Chisinau government of ceding control of the country to foreign forces.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The purpose of the Agreement is to create the legal framework for the actions carried out jointly by the General Inspectorate of the Border Police, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and FRONTEX on the territory of the Republic of Moldova. It will allow more efficient management of the regional crisis, the flow of refugees and the improvement of the security of the Republic of Moldova. At the same time, it will develop and strengthen collaboration with the EU in the field of border management and security. The agreement will allow the FRONTEX agency to support the Republic of Moldova in border management, by sending teams that can support the Moldovan authorities in performing tasks such as registrations and checks at the border, informs a press release from the Council of Europe.
This is a civilian project and no military contingent participates in the missions, so it does not in any way violate the neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova. This statute is violated only by the Russian Federation, which illegally maintains soldiers on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, which it refuses to withdraw despite the international commitments it has made. In addition, a few dozen policemen will never be able to control such a large territory.
Narratives regarding the control of the West over the Republic of Moldova were the main themes of the socialists, a pro-Russian political group, with the takeover of power in Chisinau by PAS, a pro-European group founded by president Maia Sandu. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""Now, it's hard to believe that Major General Alexandru Esaulenco can find a job more coveted than that of the secret service of a country! Especially since he is an information officer and followed a step-by-step career up to the highest position in the Moldovan security system. As a result, completely different than ""change of job"" should be the justification of the resignation that occurs only a few days after the arrest of the former president, Igor Dodon. The one who accused that his arrest was carried out on the orders of some Romanian consultants. Anyway, the shock wave of the ""earthquake"" from the top of the SIS will definitely be felt in Bucharest as well.
Even for the simple fact that SIS is considered the ""bridgehead"" of the Romanian secret services. Their close collaboration also made possible the spectacular victory of Maia Sandu in the presidential elections. However, as our sources claim, the resignation of the head of the SIS could be related to the procedural blunder that the arrest of Russian-speaker Igor Dodon was carried out by the officers of the Information Service, not by those of the Ministry of the Interior. Anyway, ""slaughter"" is announced on the front in Chisinau, between the Romanian and Russian secret services!""
NARRATIVES: 1. Igor Dodon was detained on the order of some Romanian consultants from the Republic of Moldova 2. The Moldovan special services are the ""bridgehead"" of the Romanian ones 3. The SIS would not have had legal grounds to participate in Dodon's detention.
CONTEXT: The former pro-Russian president of the Republic of Moldova, Igor Dodon, was detained and then received 30 days of house arrest under the suspicion of having committed four criminal acts.
Dodon is accused of illicit enrichment, passive corruption, treason and financing of his party by an organized criminal group.
He was detained on May 24 for 72 hours, then received from the party 30 house arrest, which the prosecutors unsuccessfully tried to replace with one of deprivation of liberty.
OBJECTIVE: To mislead the public that Igor Dodon is a victim of internal politics, but also of some games outside the country.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The fact that Igor Dodon would have said that he was detained on the orders of the Romanian consultants from various institutions in the Republic of Moldova is a statement taken out of context and interpreted tendentially by the author of the article.
More precisely, Dodon stated the following, upon his release from pretrial detention on May 26: ""It is strange and vile to accuse me of treason by those who at this stage filled all the state institutions with foreign Romanian, American, German advisors who controls all the institutions, including in the presidential institution there are dozens of foreign advisers paid from outside the country"", according to Pro TV Chisinau.
Also, the statement that the Moldovan secret services are somehow subordinate to the Romanian ones is false. Moreover, during the communist government of Vladimir Voronin (2000-2008), but also after this time, the services of the two countries seem to have been in conflict. This conflict would also lead to a war of ""kompromat"" type recordings. First, against the backdrop of bilateral tensions amplified by Chisinau after the so-called Twitter Revolution in April 2009, the press from the two countries received a recording with the Romanian consul in Republic of Moldova, Ion Nuica, and an employee of the consulate. Later, a recording was published in Romania with a prominent member of the Communist Party and two prostitutes. Officially, the sources of both recordings remained anonymous.
Until now, no information has appeared regarding close ties between the Information and Security Service (SIS) of the Republic of Moldova and Romanian services; instead, they talked about some connections between SIS officers and Russia. The most recent example is that of the former SIS officer, Evgheni Kuzmin, who became an adviser to Vadim Ceban, the head of Moldovagaz, Gazprom's subsidiary in the Republic of Moldova. On April 1, 2022, Kuzmin was searched by his former colleagues from the SIS for disclosing state secrets.
Another false information released by the author of the National article is that SIS should not have participated in Dodon's detention. According to the laws of the Republic of Moldova, the SIS has the competence to participate in criminal investigations, and one of the charges is treason, which is in any case within the competence of the SIS.
SIS collaborates on various cases with the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Moldova.
Finally, after the loss of the presidential elections by Dodon and the Socialist Party, it is unlikely that the former president of the Republic of Moldova will represent a stake, let alone one that would justify pressure for his arrest from Romania or an underground war between the secret services Romanian and Russian ones.

Underneath an ""off-shore"" disinformation
facebook.com / geaninaserbandeputatAUR / May 18, 2022; factual.ro / May 30, 2022
The invasion of Ukraine, followed by the Western sanctions applied to Russia and the increase in the price of natural gas have led several states to reconsider their energy policies. On May 18, the Romanian Parliament amended the Offshore Law to encourage investors to exploit hydrocarbons in the Black Sea. On the same day, the deputy of the Alliance for Romanian Unity Geanina Serban posted on her Facebook page a vehement criticism of the new provisions, accusing the governing coalition of leaving the exploitation of natural gas in the hands of foreign companies, which will no longer have the obligation to supply a part from Romanian production. The journalists from Factual.ro checked the text of the law and found that the Romanian state continues to receive royalties, but also tax rates of up to 70% depending on the additional income obtained. According to a Deloitte study, the additional revenues to the budget will amount to 26 billion dollars until 2040. It is true, compared to the 2018 version, the law no longer obliges companies to trade half of the amount of gas extracted based on the regulations imposed by ANRE. Instead, a newly introduced article gives the Ministry of Energy the possibility to impose ""temporary price and sales restrictions for the quantities necessary"" to ensure household consumption and thermal energy for the population. In other words, contrary to the post of parliamentarian AUR, the Romanian state can impose on those who exploit to sell its gas with priority. Equally baseless is the insinuation of MP Geanina Serban that the exploitation of natural gas from the Black Sea can only be done by foreign companies. After taking over the American share from Exxon, the Romgaz company owns half of the Neptun Deep concession, the largest natural gas deposit, with an estimated 84 billion cubic meters. In addition, Romgaz also has 12% of the Trident deposit, the second largest, with 30 billion cubic meters.
Conspiracy theories and the Texas massacre
apnews.com / May 26, 2022, france24.com / May 25, 2022
The tragedy at the elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, where an 18-year-old American gunned down 19 students and two teachers, being himself killed by the police, gave birth to a wave of misinformation online about the perpetrator of the crimes . The fakes distributed on Twitter and Reddit resume the established themes of the Qanon conspiracists: Salvador Ramos would have been an illegal immigrant in the United States, he was transgender and the massacre would actually have been staged. Many users were quick to blame the incident - the second most serious ever to happen in an American school - on the Joe Biden administration, arguing without grounds that there would have been fewer crimes with firearms during Donald Trump's term. The expert in combating disinformation consulted by the Associated Press believes that this kind of reaction reflects major problems such as racism and intolerance, and the tactic used aims to avoid discussing armed violence and gun control.
The world food crisis - the weapon of Russian propaganda
dw.com / May 28, 2022, euvsdisinfo.eu / May 26, 2022
Another collateral effect of the war started by Russia against Ukraine is the risk of a global food crisis, signaled as such by the World Food Program of the United Nations. Known as the ""granary of Europe"", Ukraine is a major agricultural exporter worldwide. In an attempt to subdue the Ukrainians, Russia targeted not only the big cities, but also grain silos, field crops and agricultural machinery. The invaders have destroyed or largely stole processing and transportation capabilities and, worst of all, blocked Ukrainian grain exports through Black Sea ports.If the Russian military's actions destabilize the global food market, Kremlin propaganda plays up the inherent tensions, hoping to undercut support which Kiev enjoys. The disinformation vectors are trying to convince the public that the real cause of the explosion in food and fuel prices is not the war, but the Western sanctions applied to Moscow. These theories circulate in several languages, not only in Europe, being taken over and amplified in reality, the international sanctions imposed on Russia are aimed at undermining the Kremlin's ability to finance its armed aggression - the real cause of the crisis - and not the agricultural field. Moreover, Western sanctions explicitly provide for exceptions for food exports. One of the most perverse messages promoted by the Russians, including at the diplomatic level, is that, through the exports of agricultural products, Ukraine would actually pay for the weapons offered as aid by Western countries. The President of the State Duma himself recently stated that, although he claims to help Kiev, Washington is planning to introduce famine in Ukraine. Other misinformation claims that the Ukrainians and not the Russians are the ones blocking the grain ships in their own ports. Russian speakers are being targeted with deceptively tailored messages: after years of denying the existence of the Holodomor - the military famine with tens of millions of victims programmed by Stalin in the 1930s to destroy the Ukrainian peasantry -, the pro-Kremlin press is now presenting the blockade of the ports by the Russian army as having a noble purpose, namely protecting the Ukrainians from a new Holodomor, set up by the Kiev authorities. To start a war that generates a global food crisis and then claim the merits of being a ""savior"" goes beyond Orwell's literary patterns - euvsdisinfo analysts remark.

The false narrative is used to justify the detention of some OSCE experts in Donbass.
NEWS: Ukrainian militants from ""Azovstal"" received communications [equipment] with the help of international ""observers"" of the OSCE Special Mission, informs the correspondent of the ""Donetki tormozok"" publication, which quotes the post of the former head of the Security Council of the People's Republic Donetsk, Aleksandr Khodakovski.
In his comment, the commander of the ""Vostok"" battalion published a photo of a phone with satellite connection used by the military from the Azovstal plant.
""All these years, the OSCE was suspected by us of helping the enemy. We were sure that their cameras, scattered abundantly along the contact line with the aim of monitoring the observance of the truce, were transmitting information about our actions to the enemy,"" he added.
NARRATIVE: OSCE collaborates with the ""Azov"" regiment from Mariupol and provides it with information.
CONTEXT: On the Telegram channel of the self-proclaimed head of the Security Council of the Donetsk People's Republic, Aleksandr Khodakovski, a photo of a satellite phone with an OSCE label, which is supposed to have been used by the regiment, was published. Azov"".
From the photo posted on Telegram, it is not clear if it is a phone used by OSCE observers, if it was found in ""Azovstal"" or somewhere else, if it is a real or fake image. This phone could have ended up in the hands of the separatists for a long time some time ago and now it is used to blame the OSCE for supporting the ""Azov"" regiment, considered by Russia to be a terrorist and a Nazi.
The phone could still be found in the OSCE offices in eastern Ukraine, located in the cities occupied by the Russian military. It is not known if these phones were used by the Ukrainian military and if they were found in Azovstal or in other cities.
OBJECTIVE: The media controlled by the Kremlin started a real campaign to discredit the efforts of the OSCE to maintain peace in the area in order to convince the domestic public opinion that the evidence of international experts regarding Russian destabilizing actions in Donbass is false.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the experts of the OSCE Special Mission in Ukraine monitored, starting in 2014, both the activity of the ""Azov"" regiment and the pro-Russian separatists in Donbass, something proven, moreover, by the reports that they presented them regularly.
OSCE representatives repeatedly complained about the unfounded criticism of the separatist leaders, drawing attention to the fact that they only published official reports and did not support any part of the conflict. The head of the special OSCE monitoring mission in Ukraine actually sees the criticism as an indication of impartiality. At the same time, both Russia and the leaders financed by it in Donbass had the right, during the last 8 years, to get rid of the OSCE presence in the area because the experts were documenting all the violations of the truce.
The propaganda narrative is in fact a justification for the arrest of four members of the OSCE special mission in Lugansk and Donetsk, on charges of collaboration with foreign intelligence services. 3 days after the international experts were detained in eastern Ukraine, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zbigniew Rau, and the Secretary General of the OSCE, Helga Maria Schmid, condemned this action.
The OSCE statement says that the members of the Special Mission must be released immediately, and ""the permanent accusations against the members of the OSCE mission are absurd"". Publication / Media:

The objective is to sow panic among the Ukrainian population and to convince the internal public opinion that the ""special operation"" is being carried out successfully and can be extended to other Ukrainian regions.
NEWS: ""The Kiev regime is preparing to cede the city of Zaporozhye,"" the member of the main council of the Zaporozhye Regional Administration, Vladimir Rogov, told RIA Novosti.
Previously he communicated that two thirds of the territory of the region was liberated by the Russian army from the control of Ukrainian nationalists. Kyiv controls the regional center - the city of Zaporozhye.
The Zaporizhia authorities declare that Ukraine has forever lost access to the Sea of ​​Azov. Zaporozhye will be liberated. Our enemies are also aware of this fact. That's why evacuation is discussed 24 hours a day. Zelenski's representatives from the city have prepared their bags and are transporting the expensive things from the city,"" said Rogov.
He declared that after the liberation of Donbass, the turn of the city of Zaporizhia will come. In the special operation, the Russian military took control over the Kherson region and a part of the Zaporozhye region in the south of the country, which has access to the sea. Military-civilian administrations were established in the regions, television and radio stations from Russia began to be broadcast, commercial ties with Crimea are being restored"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine will cede the city of Zaporozhye to Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly declared that they will not cede a single millimeter of Ukrainian territory to Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized those who recommend Ukrainians to capitulate to Russia and cede territories and emphasized that Ukraine will not cede territories on its own initiative and will not abandon its citizens.
Part of the Zaporozhye region is occupied by Russia, but the Ukrainian military is consolidating its defense fortifications. According to Lieutenant General Serghei Naev, Ukrainian defenders are successfully repelling Russian attacks in the Zaporozhye region, although Moscow is concentrating more and more of its military forces in the south of Ukraine. In addition, some localities in the southeast of the country were liberated by the Ukrainian army, the most recent being the successful counter-offensive in the direction of Krivoi Rog.
Indeed, in the city of Zaporizhia, there is discussion about a possible evacuation of civilians, as a plan B, if the Ukrainian army will no longer be able to defend the town. The discussions about the possible evacuation plan do not, however, mean the surrender of the administrative center of Zaporizhia, but only the acceptance of the possibility that, at a given moment, a withdrawal could be imposed, these being otherwise related to the nature of the war. Losing a certain territory to an enemy does not mean giving up that territory or abandoning plans to recover it.
The person quoted by the Russian press, Vladimir Rogov, is not the representative of the Zaporizhia Regional Administration, but the representative of the Russian occupation bodies in the southeast of Ukraine. He fled to Russia in 2014, after speaking out against Euromaidan, he supported the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass, and in 2022 he was brought by Russia as a representative of Moscow in the Zaporozhye region. Rogov was prosecuted for collaborating with Russia. Like the representatives of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, Rogov does not know what the real situation is in Zaporozhye, because the Russian army is still far from the town.
The propaganda narrative was distributed after the Russian press wrote in April that the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye requested to join the People's Republic of Donetsk. Also, the Russian press also wrote that the south of Ukraine, liberated by the nationalists, wants to be joined to Russia. Veridica dismantled these and other fake news, which aim to prepare public opinion in Russia for new heated phases of the conflict in Donbass and its expansion to other regions. Equally, the Kremlin sows panic among Ukrainian society and builds false justifications for a new wave of the offensive called by the Kremlin ""special operation for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine"".

And the result can be the same as in Ukraine - the disintegration of the state"", writes mejdurecie.md.
NARRATIVE: Igor Dodon is the victim of an international conspiracy, which aims to involve the Republic of Moldova in the war against Russia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The former pro-Russian president of the Republic of Moldova and ex-leader of the Socialist Party, Igor Dodon, was detained on May 24, being suspected by prosecutors of corruption, illicit enrichment, illegal financing of the party and treason. On May 26, the court ordered Dodon's house arrest for a period of 30 days, but the prosecutors contested the decision, demanding that he be kept in solitary confinement.
Igor Dodon is a controversial figure in the Republic of Moldova: he made a career during the communist government, then he betrayed his protector, former president Vladimir Voronin, in 2011, and left with some of the PCRM members to the Socialist Party. A decade later, the two made a common front in the elections, but lost them.
In 2016, Igor Dodon became president, being supported from the shadows, unassumingly, by the controversial businessman and politician, Vlad Plahotniuc, as was seen in the media controlled by the oligarch.
The file in which Igor Dodon is targeted, known as the ""kuliokul"" (bag) file, starts from several video recordings in which the former president was negotiating with Vlad Plahotniuc regarding a political alliance in Parliament, in June 2019. The two discussed including about a plan for the federalization of the Republic of Moldova, requested by the Kremlin (on this, most likely, the charge for treason is based). At one point, Plahotniuc hands Dodon a black bag, where it is supposed to be was money, and Dodon asked him to pass it on to a certain Cornel (most likely Cornel Furculita, a close associate of Dodon) who was going to ""pay the salaries"" (probably, this is what the indictment for illegal financing of the party is based on) .
Dodon, however, did not form an alliance with Plahotniuc, even though they apparently understood each other and later declared that some images were rigged or were taken out of context and that he actually tricked Plahotniuc in order to form a coalition against him.
The images with the black bag appeared in May 2020. The prosecutor's office then opened a file, which it closed, but a court overturned the decision two weeks ago, the file was reopened, and last Tuesday the prosecutors went to several locations which would belong directly or indirectly to Igor Dodon. The prosecutors claim that they found expensive objects and tens of thousands of euros, including in an envelope with the symbols of a party.
After two consecutive defeats, in the presidential and parliamentary elections, Igor Dodon renounced the leadership of the party as well as the deputy mandate, in exchange for the honorary position of honorary president of the Socialist Party and president of an organization promoting Moldovan-Russian business .
OBJECTIVE: 1. To transform the file in which Igor Dodon appears into a geopolitical process in order to give relevance to the former president and revive his rating. 2. To amplify citizens' concerns regarding the involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the war in Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Igor Dodon's luxurious life has been written about for a long time and repeatedly; as well as the suspicions regarding the illegal financing of the Socialist Party.
Investigations on these charges were previously opened, but without result, in the conditions where there were many suspicions about the obedience of the general prosecutor (suspended since the fall of last year), Alexandr Stoianoglo, who is now one step away from being dismissed.
The subject of a possible involvement in the war against Russia of the Republic of Moldova is one that is often amplified by some politicians and media institutions, but this has no basis in the conditions in which the Republic of Moldova is a neutral state, the citizens would not support such a decision, and the army it is much too weak to count in a possible military intervention.

However, the communiqué refers to the war crimes committed by the Russian army, denounced by all major Western capitals.
NEWS: ""The USA, the European Union and Great Britain have created a commission to investigate the ""atrocities"" in Ukraine, according to the official website of the US State Department.
""The European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom announced today the creation of an advisory group for the investigation of crimes (ACA). This group will strengthen the efforts of the EU, the US and Great Britain to hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities in Ukraine"", it is mentioned on the official website of the US State Department.
Previously, Russia launched a special operation for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that he had to take this decision to protect the inhabitants of Donbass from genocide. According to the head of state, the citizens of Donbass were subjected to punitive attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Russian leader, in particular, told about the atrocities of the Ukrainian nationalists"".
NARRATIVE: The West is investigating the ""atrocities"" of Ukrainian nationalists on the territory of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The news, which at first glance seems to provide information, is actually war propaganda, constructed by omitting some important fragments from the text of the State Department's communique. ""The initiative will directly support the efforts of the Ukrainian General Prosecutor's Office to document, preserve and analyze evidence regarding war crimes and other atrocities committed by members of the Russian forces in Ukraine.""
The Russian press does not mention anything about the atrocities of the Russian army in Ukraine, nor does it send a hyperlink to the press release in English, but retells it through the prism of its own false narratives, distributed during the last years.
""It is important to ensure that all those responsible for the terrible atrocities committed during the unprovoked Russian military aggression in Ukraine are brought to justice,"" said the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, who is involved in this initiative.
Therefore, the purpose of creating this crime investigation group is to hold accountable the Russian military who committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine. The communiques and statements of Western officials do not mention anything about the atrocities of the Ukrainian nationalists.
Other Russian media outlets, including TASS, intentionally mistranslated the US State Department's press release, stating that ""war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine will be documented,"" removing any mention of Russia or the Russian military. .
Towards the end of the news, the false narratives about the genocide against Russian-speakers in Donbass, about Russia's special operation and about Ukrainian nationalists who committed war crimes in eastern Ukraine are repeated. In reality, Russia invaded Ukraine unprovoked on February 24, destroying towns, bombing military and civilian infrastructure, killing women, children and the elderly.
Some evidence (satellite images, drone footage) unequivocally attests that the Russian military committed war crimes in the Kiev region. Ukraine asked the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send investigators as soon as possible to gather evidence of war crimes.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives, according to which the French gendarmes will hide the traces of the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea, while the Ukrainian nationalists will shoot at civilians again. In April, the Russian press wrote that American experts believe that the news about the atrocities of the Russian military in Ukraine are an invention of Ukrainian propaganda. The propaganda narrative was also dismantled, according to which the UN admitted that the Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for military purposes, and Zelenski announces the organization of a new genocide of Russian speakers in Kharkiv and Donbass.

In reality, the mentioned localities have long been occupied by Russia, and the local council claims war crimes committed by the Russian military.
NEWS: Neo-Nazis from the ""Azov"" battalion established resistance points and barracks and also brought weapons to kindergartens in Mirnograd, Donetsk People's Republic and Borovaia, Kharkiv region. This was announced on Tuesday by the head of the Center of control of the national defense of the Russian Federation, colonel-general Mihail Mizintev.
The ""Neo-Nazis"" of the ""Azov"" battalion from Borovaia, Kharkiv region, founded barracks in the school building and in the Beriozka kindergarten and brought military equipment, heavy weapons, artillery and rockets to their territory. At the same time, civilians and children are kept with force in the basements,"" said Mizintev, who heads the Interdepartmental Coordination Center of the Russian Federation for Humanitarian Aid in Ukraine. [...] ""Armored vehicles and artillery were deployed in the immediate vicinity of residential areas,"" he added.
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian neo-Nazis are holding captive civilians from the Kharkiv region.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the towns in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions mentioned in the news distributed by the Russian media were occupied by the Russian military on April 13. That is why the actions described by the Russian colonel-general are impossible: deploying armored vehicles and artillery near schools, locking civilians in basements, establishing resistance points and barracks.
According to a press release from the Borovaia local council in the Kharkiv region, on April 27 the Russian occupiers entered the local school and kindergarten. After the Russian soldiers withdrew, the school was destroyed and looted, and they blamed the ""neo-Nazis"" of the ""Azov"" regiment. This regiment (which comes from a militia that had links with the extreme right but was reorganized and integrated into the security forces of Ukraine for many years) was never present in Borovaia. The images posted by the local council show that the school and the kindergarten are destroyed, it being impossible to keep civilians in captivity in their premises or to use them as barracks or points of armed resistance.
Borovaia local council describes on its Facebook page every step of the occupation regime, mentioning the resistance of Ukrainians. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine admitted that the towns of Borovaia and Mirnograd are occupied by Russia, being located quite far from the front line.
As in the case of the city of Mariupol, the occupation authorities blame the Ukrainian army or the fighters of the ""Azov"" regiment, considered neo-Nazi by Russia, for the war crimes committed by the Russian military.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives, according to which Ukraine was preparing to attack the Donbass and masked its intentions by hiding soldiers in schools and hospitals, and Russia discovered nationalist concentration camps in eastern Ukraine.
In order to absolve Russia, the pro-Kremlin press wrote starting on February 24 that the Ukrainian military are neo-Nazis and commit war crimes against civilians in eastern and southern Ukraine. In reality, it is Russia that is bombing Ukrainian cities and has destroyed numerous civilian targets, including apartment buildings, schools, etc. In the Kiev region, the collection of evidence continues, with the support of some teams of experts from the EU, in order to hold Russia accountable for the war crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine.

Armament manufacturers want a New World Order and pay the Western press to make pro-Ukrainian propaganda, according to some false narratives published in Bucharest.
NEWS: Does anyone want to know the truth about the war in Ukraine? Certainly, there are no interested parties, only propaganda actions. Western chancelleries recommend that we only serve portions of lies from ""official sources.""
Will Putin succeed in fulfilling Peter the Great's will? Will Nova Russia do it? Will the US win the proxy war? What do we know about the evolution of the front? Nothing. We are bombarded from all directions with fake news. And the big lies are only taken from ""official sources [...] I used to wake up in the morning opening the reference press from Great Britain and the USA, I have come to the conclusion that the most prestigious publications are remotely controlled by an unseen command of the New Big Brother. How is it that the same headlines appear on the front pages: The horrors of Bucea, The ghost of Kiev, the Russian crimes in Serpilor Island, The bombing of the maternity hospital in Mariupol? And all of these are subsequently invalidated, not only because of the lack of evidence, but also because of information contradictory [...] Asked why I don't see how children are killed in Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, I cynically answered that I don't even know who sent the minors to the great Children's Crusade.

Is there a cash register? Or do the world's major arms manufacturers deliver bags of money through the editors? War propagandists have the mission to convince the public that ""you are saved when you have a bullet in your barrel and your brain is roaring with hate."" Beware of the propaganda of various forms of power! It's toxic. Who wins the war? It depends on which camp you are: of Zelenskiy's admirers or of his objections? And you will give yourself the answer. Even if Russia will take back its territories, the winners will be those who rewrite history and reinvent the power poles of the world"" OBJECTIVE: Undermining citizens' trust in the Western press.
NARRATIVES: 1. The Western press lies guided by the interests of the major arms manufacturers. 2. Children are killed because they are sent to this war from Ukraine 3. The USA is waging a proxy war in Ukraine against Russia 4. The Bucea massacre and the bombing of the maternity hospital in Mariupol are just propaganda inventions 5. Russia will take back its territories from to Ukraine.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Russia attacked Ukraine for the first time in 2014, after pro-European forces, who wanted Ukraine's EU integration, came to power in Kiev following a popular uprising. The Putin regime has always considered that the ex-Soviet space must be part of Russia's sphere of influence (practically, be vassal to it) and, at the same time, as demonstrated by the internal repressive policy, it considered liberal democracies a threat. A democratic country on the territory claimed by Moscow, with an independent press and a functional civil society is perceived as a danger because it shows that there are alternative models to the authoritarian system proposed by the Kremlin.
The Kremlin tried to block Ukraine's rapprochement with Western democracies and invented a double pretext: on the one hand, it claimed that the pro-European forces were, in fact, Nazis, on the other hand, that Ukraine represented a security threat Russia, as it would bring NATO to its borders (given that Russia is the one that invaded, Ukraine wants to join NATO precisely to be defended by Russia and NATO is a defensive alliance, which would intervene only in case of a Russian aggression against a member) .
After the launch of the large-scale invasion, in February 2022, the narratives regarding NATO's presence in Ukraine (and its involvement in the conflict) were also used to justify Russia's failures on the ground.
Similarly, the older narratives, dismantled repeatedly, regarding the Ukrainian Nazis were also used either to justify certain actions of the Russians (for example, the bombing of some civilian targets under the pretext that there were positions of right-wing forces there) or to place responsibility for crimes committed by the Russians (the massacres in Bucea and other localities near Kiev, the bombing of the theater in Mariupol, etc.). However, the Russian propaganda was dismantled by the information coming from the scene, many of which were transmitted and verified by the Western press that has correspondents on the scene.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The major newsrooms of the Western world have sent reporters to all the major cities of Ukraine, as well as to the hot areas of the front.
Also, the satellites of the Western countries are focused on the front in Ukraine, and some of these images are made public. Russia can no longer mask its attacks, including atrocities, by denying them or invoking the so-called ""fog of war"" (the fog of war, where certain things cannot be seen).
There is no evidence to prove that the Western press is financed by the big arms manufacturers.
Regarding the crimes committed against children, this falls under the responsibility of Russia as an invading state that constantly bombards areas with civilians. Children are not sent to the front, but are victims of this invasion.
The West supports Ukraine with weapons and imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the latter's aggressions; therefore, Russia is not the victim, but the aggressor, and the West does not wage a campaign against Moscow, but offers (limited) assistance to an independent state to defend itself against an aggressor.
There are numerous evidences (drone and satellite images, etc.) and testimonies regarding the war crimes committed by the Russians in Bucea. However, Russia has launched numerous false narratives through which it tries to pass responsibility (see, for example, the narratives debunked by Veridica here and here).
Also, Russia initially denied, then admitted that it bombed the maternity hospital in Mariupol, but because Ukrainian troops were hiding there. The factual checks made by USAToday demonstrated that there were no Ukrainian troops in the building when the Russians bombed the civilian objective in question.
Last but not least, Russian propaganda tries to justify the illegal annexations of territories from Ukraine - Crimea, or those they would like to annex as a recovery from Ukraine (Donbass and Lugansk), an independent state with internationally recognized borders.

It is the latest in a series of false narratives through which Russia tries to justify its aggression by saying that Ukraine would develop, with Western support, biological weapons.
NEWS: ""Ukrainian refugees are checked in the European Union if they are not sick with tuberculosis because it is known about the biological activity of NATO in Ukraine, said on May 18 during a press conference the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zakharova.
""Do you know which analyzes are primarily required of citizens who arrive in the EU member states from Ukraine? Tuberculosis tests? Why? Because they know what the NATO structures were dealing with there, they know very well,"" said the diplomat.
Previously, Maria Zaharova promised to report on new facts regarding the experiments in the biological laboratories of the USA in Ukraine. In particular, she will tell about the experiments on humans"".
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian refugees are checked in the EU if they are not sick with tuberculosis that comes from NATO laboratories.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the EU states did not introduce new customs controls for Ukrainians, but, on the contrary, liberalized the border crossing regime. Mothers passed with children who did not have passports. The requirement to present the anti-COVID-19 vaccination certificates has also been cancelled, the passports of farm animals s.a. no longer need to be presented. The new simplified border crossing procedures for Ukrainians have been published by the European Commission.
Also, it is allowed to stay on the territory of the EU for a longer period, Ukrainian citizens obtaining the right to work for a period of 9 months, which was impossible before. In the new rules for entering, finding or transiting the EU states, nothing is mentioned about tuberculosis testing.
Regarding the metanarrative about the laboratories in Ukraine where biological weapons were produced or developed, Veridica dismantled a series of fake news on this topic. In March, the Russian press wrote that the coronavirus was produced in secret laboratories in Ukraine. At the beginning of the invasion, Kremlin spokesmen declared that Russia had destroyed American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. In April, the Russian press wrote that Ukraine attacked Russian military positions with chemical and biological weapons, using military drones. In reality, the Russian government media and the Ministry of Defense in Moscow presented an agricultural drone from southern Ukraine as chemical and biological weapons!
The history of this false narrative is older and since 2020 the US embassy in Kiev has reacted to it by stating that there is no American secret laboratory on the territory of Ukraine. At the same time, in 2007 Ukraine ratified the Convention on the non-proliferation of biological weapons.
So far, Moscow has not presented any concrete proof of the existence of such laboratories, but it has justified the attack on Ukrainian cities by the need to destroy them.
The purpose of these propaganda narratives is to justify Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine, presenting them as a series of measures necessary to destroy biological weapons production laboratories. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""The President of the Moldovan-Russian Business Union called ""idiocy"" the intention of the Moldovan authorities to examine the subject of withdrawal from the CIS. In the program ""Glavnyi vopros"" from the television station NTV Moldova, Igor Dodon noted that this means not only the breaking of all economic agreements, but also the termination of the visa-free regime with the countries of the Community.
""Imagine that tomorrow there will be a visa regime with Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, etc. Why do we do this? But where will we export our goods, where will we deliver our apples after this situation in Ukraine ends? And where will we buy energy resources? Do you think the Romanians will sell to us? And the Romanians are now buying Russian gas! Or Germany? They are also using Russian gas, only we will buy more expensively from others"", - declared Igor Dodon"". NARRATIVES: 1. The CIS is a lifeline for the Republic of Moldova. 2. Renunciation of CIS member status will be an extremely heavy blow for the economy of the Republic of Moldova.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was created in December 1991, with the official breakup of the former USSR. It initially included 12 of the 15 former Soviet republics (the Baltic States did not join), and Moscow played the role of first violin from the very beginning. Georgia left the CIS after the Russian invasion in 2008, and Ukraine announced the same in 2018, but did not complete all legal procedures.
In the Republic of Moldova, CIS membership is viewed differently in society and in the political environment, just like most subjects related to the country's foreign policy. Pro-Russian politicians such as the former president and ex-leader of the Socialists Igor Dodon present the presence of the Republic of Moldova in the CIS as a ""holy cow"" that will ensure the market for Moldovan products and cheap energy resources, even if the CIS market no longer absorbs not even 10% of exports, given that Russia has imposed customs duties on several agricultural products (in violation of CIS agreements), and the Republic of Moldova buys gas at the market price.
Igor Dodon made the respective comments after the President of the Parliament, Igor Grosu, declared in a broadcast on the public radio station - Radio Moldova - that in the conditions where the share of the CIS market is decreasing, Russia violated the provisions of the organization and imposed taxes customs for Moldovan products, after the end of the war in Ukraine, an analysis and debates about the necessity of remaining in this organization will be necessary.
OBJECTIVE: To arouse the concern of the population about the losses that the economy will have and the risks that the withdrawal of the Republic of Moldova from the CIS, an organization controlled by Moscow, would involve
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The share of Moldovan exports to the CIS is continuously decreasing from year to year, especially after in 2014 the Russian Federation imposed customs duties on the majority of Moldovan products that traditionally reached the Russian market - fruits and vegetables. In the first three months of the current year, the CIS share in Moldovan exports was less than 10% of the total. The Republic of Moldova exported to the entire CIS area three times less than in Romania. Exports to Russia were six times lower than those destined for Romania, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.
The Republic of Moldova buys gas from the Russian Federation at the market price, currently this is the only viable way to import natural gas - therefore, not even in the field of energy, Chisinau has any advantage from the relationship with the CIS. However, the Republic of Moldova will participate in the project launched by the EU for the joint purchase of natural gas, which will make it less vulnerable to Gazprom. Also, in the coming years, Romania could also export gas to the Republic of Moldova.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: A possible decision of Chisinau to give up its membership status of the CIS could have certain economic repercussions, but insignificant, considering the weight of the commercial relations it currently has with the member states of this organization. Publication / Media:

NEWS: The adviser to the Zelenski administration, Podoleak, proposed to organize a total genocide in the Kharkiv region, but also in the people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk until the word ""Russians"" will be definitively forgotten.
Kiev no longer hides the information about what Russia so often reminded the West and why German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was laughing. The adviser to the head of the Zelensky Administration, Podoleak, admitted directly to a television station that he wants a total genocide in the Kharkiv region, but also in the people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk until the word ""Russians"" is definitively forgotten.
I want the word ""Russian"" to be forgotten in the Kharkiv region, Podoleak said, quoted by Strana.ua. I want the word ""Russian"" to be forgotten in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
In addition, the Zelensky administration does not hide the fact that it wants to kill the members of the leadership of the people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. I mentioned that in this way the Ukrainian authorities get rid of people unsuitable for the Kiev regime. On August 31, 2018, the head of the DNR, Aleksandr Zaharcneko, was killed first in Donetsk, during an assassination attack.
NARRATIVE: Zelenski's adviser announces the organization of a genocide of Russian speakers in Kharkiv and Donbass
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Mihailo Podoliak, the advisor to the president of Ukraine, did not refer, in the statement broadcast by the national ICTV television channel, to the launch of an operation to ""cleanse"" the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Lugansk regions of Russian speakers. He did not pronounce the word ""genocide"".
Podoliak was asked to comment on the situation on the Russian-Ukrainian front and declared that he wants to see Ukraine freed from the Russian occupiers. Zelensky's adviser stated that Ukraine must ""be very tough with Russian collaborators and soldiers"". He said that Ukraine wants to liberate the regions of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson from the Russian invaders, adding that in these regions there must be forgot the word ""Russian"".
The target of Podoliak's speech is the Russian forces and their collaborators; there was no mention of the civilian population, regardless of whether it is Russian speakers or Ukrainian speakers. Moreover, a large part of the population of the regions seized by Moscow following the February 24 invasion fled from the path of the Russian forces, generally taking refuge to the west, in Ukraine and outside it. The population that did not succeed or did not want to flee did not accept the occupation; there are numerous reports from the Kherson area about the resistance of the population. Although Moscow tries to legitimize its invasion by saying that it is liberating a Russian-speaking population that no longer wants to be part of Ukraine, the mobilization of Ukrainians shows that the Russians are seen as an enemy by the majority of the population, which wants to stay in Ukraine. The brutality of the Russian forces, which can be seen in the bombing of numerous civilian targets, the summary executions of civilians, rapes, robberies - shows that these are the ones who treat the civilian population as an enemy.
The population remaining in the areas occupied by the Russians is seen as a hostage population and Kiev wants its release.
As regards the ""toughness"" towards the Russian forces and their Ukrainian collaborators, Kiev has repeatedly insisted that it respects the Geneva Conventions, in the case of the former, and the national legislation, in the case of the collaborators who, in any case, do not risk being sentenced to death because Ukraine has repealed the capital sentence.
The narrative regarding a ""genocide"" committed against Russian-speakers is not new, and its variants have been dismantled over time by Veridica. In March, the Russian press wrote that the UN supports the genocide directed against Russian-speakers in Ukraine, in November 2021 the news agencies from Moscow they wrote that Ukraine continues the genocide in Donbass with Turkish drones, and in September 2021 the central Russian television stations announced that the Ukrainian army could clean Donbass and Crimea of ​​the Russian-speaking population.

NEWS: ""To understand what kind of war is going on in Ukraine, we have to go back to Carl von Clausewitz, the father of military strategies. The Prussian general claimed that the war is practically unlimited in variety, complex and changing and fixed, this is how the ""special operation"" that is taking place near our country shows. There is a de facto proxy war between the West and Russia, and the Ukrainian forces are NATO's sword. The goal of the West is to ""bleed Russia"", that's why it pumps billions into arming Kiev. Ukraine is not just a regional struggle between two neighbors who have taken each other on the map. Ukraine is the first phase of a larger plan that seeks to crush Russia, collapse its economy, remove political leaders, confiscate natural resources and fragment the territory.
Everyone knows who wants this! The war in Ukraine is about projecting US power in Central Asia, right up to the edge of the Pacific, it's about hegemony, empire and pure force! Most importantly, Ukraine is the first battle to be fought in the Third World War, a war invented and launched to ensure American supremacy in the world.
For his part, Putin knows that if he does not find a way to block the aid received by Ukraine as quickly as possible, he may end up losing more than this armed conflict. For now, the Kremlin is content to observe that not all NATO countries speak the same language, but these dissensions may not help the Russian Federation much [...] American President Joe Biden and British Boris Johnson promise that they will be satisfied only with a total defeat of Russia. The new vuvuzelas in the EU - Poland and the Baltic states - also demand an apocalyptic end of Russian history [...] Recently, Biden and Johnson seem to have understood that things are more complicated on the Russian-Ukrainian front and have changed , somehow, the tone. The Common Vision Statement issued in Washington following the US-ASEAN special summit completely avoids the usual American rhetoric and hyperbole on ""Russian aggression"" in Ukraine. NARRATIVES: 1. The West is waging a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine 2. The war in Ukraine is a first step in the West's attempt to completely destroy Russia 3. The USA wants to gain supremacy in the world by controlling Central Asia. 4. The EU countries are divided and not all of them have the same interests as the USA and Great Britain.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Russia invaded Ukraine for the first time in 2014, when pro-Europeans came to power in Kiev following a protest movement, the Euromaidan, against the decision of the then president, Viktor Yanukovych, not to sign the Association Agreement to the EU. Russia had exerted enormous pressure on Yanukovych, who was, after all, a pro-Russian politician. Russia refused to accept Ukraine's approach to the EU as it considers that it should be part of its sphere of influence; in addition, the measures taken by the Putin regime against civil society, the independent press and the opposition - extremely important in democratic countries - show the fear of the model of liberal democracies. A prosperous and democratic Ukraine can influence, through the model it offers, also the Russians, showing them that this model is viable.
Russia claimed that its invasion aims to de-Nazify Ukraine, perpetuating a false narrative that it has been using since the Euromaidan period and which has been dismantled repeatedly.
Another reason for the invasion is the so-called risk of NATO expansion, although Russia, not the Alliance, is the aggressor power in Europe. For years, Ukraine has felt the need to have the security guarantees offered by NATO. After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the annexation of Crimea and the capture of a part of Donbass by separatist rebels - supported with weapons and men by Russia and coordinated by it - this need for security increased. Although it is the sovereign right of any country to choose the security arrangements it has and despite the fact that it is precisely the threat that pushes Ukraine towards NATO, Russia invaded the neighboring country on a large scale on February 24, the extent of the invasion showing the intention of changing the power of in Kiev. In continuation - and for proof - of the meta-narrative regarding the expansion of NATO, Moscow now claims that Ukraine is nothing more than a battlefield of the West with Russia.
Russian officials, such as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, say that Ukraine is being used by the West to wage a war against Russia, even though Russia is the one that invaded Ukraine on February 24 and continues a large-scale war against this country.
""Nobody cares about Ukraine, Ukraine is just consumable material in the complete hybrid war against the Russian Federation. Now no one has any doubts, this has been publicly proclaimed. Josep Borrell, chief diplomat of the EU, says that ""this war must be won on the battlefield"". The English, Americans, presidents, prime ministers and ministers insist: ""We cannot let Russia win, Russia must suffer a defeat "". So, indeed, they have already declared war, but it is not a war between Ukraine and Russia, but rather a war between the West and Russia. <...> You know, it has already become a common expression that the West is ready to fight to the last Ukrainian,"" Lavrov said on May 17, quoted by the Tass agency.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 under the pretext of conducting a ""special denazification operation"". The West only provided humanitarian assistance and weapons - but even here, with limits, excluding heavy weapons in the initial phase and maintaining and currently limits regarding it - in response to the request of the aggressed state.
Veridica has already dismantled the narrative that the Ukrainian military would fight for the West against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated this recently, in his speech on May 9, Victory Day, in Moscow.
The narrative regarding the American attempt to control Central Asia, used on May 1 by the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, refers to the so-called Great Game, the dispute between the Tsarist Empire and the British Empire over Afghanistan by virtue of the idea that whoever controls Afghanistan controls Central Asia, and whoever controls Central Asia controls the world. However, the geopolitical reality has changed compared to the 19th century, and the real power resides - since the time of the British Empire - in the control of the seas. Moreover, the United States and NATO completely withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, after arriving there in response to the Al Qaeda attack, not for expansion.
The fact that the EU countries are weak and divided is already a classic theme of Russian propaganda that tries to follow the principle of ""divide et impera"" in order to seek to split public opinion, but also at the political level in Europe.
One of the tools used by Moscow for this, in addition to the propaganda that pushed this issue for years, was the subsidization of extremist parties in Europe that promoted Eurosceptic nationalist policies and rhetoric.
Last but not least, the material on National.ro was published on the same day that the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, issued the same theses and narratives at the educational marathon ""New Horizons"" organized by the ""Znanie"" society (, ""Knowledge""), as the Russian Embassy in Bucharest announced on Tuesday.

In reality, Russia has launched a real campaign of forced displacement of Ukrainians from the territories it controls. In addition, nine out of ten Ukrainians consider the Russian state an enemy.
NEWS: ""Up to now, over a million citizens of Ukraine have left for Russia and another 2.7 million have expressed their desire to move to the Russian Federation. This was stated by Aleksei Zaitev, deputy head of the Information and Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
""The Kiev authorities continue to block the evacuation of Ukrainian citizens to Russia. Despite this fact, over a million people have already left for our country, including 200,000 children. Another 2.7 million people have expressed their desire to do so,"" said the diplomat during the Friday briefing.
Russia launched an operation to demilitarize Ukraine on February 24. President Vladimir Putin called the objective of this operation ""the protection of the people who were subjected to harassment and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years"". According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the armed forces are only hitting the military infrastructure and Ukrainian troops and have fulfilled already the main tasks of the first stage - have significantly reduced the fighting potential of Ukraine. The main goal of the operation, according to the Russian military department, is called the liberation of Donbass"".
NARRATIVE: Almost three million Ukrainians want to go to Russia, fleeing the ""atrocities"" of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the statements of Russian diplomats, quoted by RIA Novosti and distributed on various Telegram channels, are part of a war propaganda metanarrative, according to which most Ukrainians want to be freed from Russia or wish any price to reach the territory of the Russian state. In April, the Russian press wrote that 95% of Ukrainians are waiting to be released by Russia - a false narrative dismantled by Veridica.
The Ukrainians whom Russia describes as ""voluntary refugees"" are, rather, deported. According to the Plenipotentiary of the Ukrainian Parliament for Human Rights, Lyudmila Denisova, Russia has created ""filtration camps"" of citizens, forcing them to enter Russian territory over 1 ,2 million Ukrainians. In other words, it is not about 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees, but about people deported or forced to arrive in Russia.
International organizations have signaled various cases of deportations of Ukrainians unsuitable for Russia in the eastern regions. Journalistic investigations have shown that Ukrainians end up in Russia after Moscow destroyed their houses. Many of them try to reach the EU through Russia, but very few succeed.
According to sociological data, Ukrainians consider Russia to be their main enemy. The majority of Ukrainians do not want the Russians to be in their country and perceive the invasion as it is - an aggression and an unprovoked attack. The Russian military has committed a series of war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, which are documented with the support of international organizations.
According to a survey conducted by the ""Rating"" group, 9 out of 10 Ukrainians hate Russia and believe in Ukraine's victory in the war with the Russian aggressor. 89% of Ukrainians believe that Russia committed war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, and see the war as a genocide against the Ukrainian people.

USA: ""Radio Sputnik"" misinforms from near the White House
globalnews.ca / May 10, 2022
""Listen to Radio Sputnik!""
This announcement broadcast hour after hour proves that the Kremlin's propaganda has found its place on the radio frequencies in the capital of the United States. WZHF, one of the two stations broadcasting Radio Sputnik, a program produced by the well-known Moscow state company, broadcasts from a few steps from the White House. In appearance, the program sounds like that of traditional American stations. In reality, the shows on 105.5 FM broadcast the usual Russian mystifications about the war in Ukraine. According to the publication globalnews.canada, the content varies from explicit pro-Russian propaganda to masked attempts to undermine trust in Western governments, media and institutions. A recent show devoted to the accusations of war crimes against the invaders portrays Russia as the victim. The star of the American version of Radio Sputnik, Lee Stranahan - self-described on Twitter as a ""supporter of Russia"" - usually introduces his program with the formula ""we broadcast live from the empire of lies"". What makes the presence of Radio Sputnik unusual in the American media landscape is that it manages to continue broadcasting even though other Russian media channels were banned, removed from their platforms or ceased their activity in the first days of the war. However, Sputnik had the idea of ​​buying airtime from local radio stations through an American company. The legal documents show that the price of airtime given to the Russians by the American companies is approximately 1.1 million dollars annually. In addition to the two radio frequencies in Washington, Sputnik also broadcasts on American territory in Kansas City, Missouri, where KCXL Radio collects $5,000 per month to host the Sputnik program six hours a day on its frequency.
Italy is investigating the ""air time"" allocated to Russian propaganda
thelocal.it / May 13, 2022, corriere.it / May 2, 2022
Meanwhile, Italy is increasingly worried about the pro-Russian disinformation promoted by the Peninsula press. The parliamentary commission for security - Copasir - has started an investigation aimed at the increased presence of pro-Kremlin commentators in television news programs. The local.it publication recalls the indignation caused by the recent broadcast of the interview with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the political talk show Zona Bianca of the private channel Rete 4. Lavrov used his presence on the show to accuse the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenski that, although he is Jewish, he is a Nazi, likening him to Hitler, who - according to the head of Russian diplomacy - would also have had Jewish blood. The statements of Lavrov, who in the same interview blamed the Bucea massacre on the Ukrainians, scandalized not only Israel. According to Corriere della Sera, the president of Italy, Mario Draghi, qualified the Russian official's comments as ""bizarre and obscene"". Another frequent appearance in TV debates that created consternation among Italian viewers is that of Nadana Fridrikhson, a journalist at Zvezda television. , controlled by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The parliamentary commission aims to establish whether the participation of Russian officials and their supporters in news broadcasts in the context of the war in Ukraine is legitimate. The president of the commission, Adolfo Urso, justified the need for the investigation and through the more than 13,000 of disinformation promoted by Moscow in the European Union starting from 2014, identified by the specialized body from Brussels.
""Eurovision"" of Ukraine and the (pro) Russian anger
bbc.com / May 16, 2022, au.news.yahoo.com / May 16, 2022, reuters.com / May 16, 2022
Sunday's victory of Ukraine at Eurovision rekindled the criticism brought to the competition in some of the previous editions: the division by the votes of the participating states of the songs in the contest is not always done only on the basis of musical criteria. As expected, this year's election was influenced by the international wave of sympathy and solidarity with the country invaded by Russia. Beyond the huge, hard-to-explain differences between the preferences of some national juries and the public, the artistic controversies and the completely unclear decision of the organizers to cancel the options of specialists from six countries - including Romania -, the image of Ukraine created immense frustration in camp of Kremlin supporters. The emotional appeal of the winning band ""Kalush"", which asked from the stage for international help to save the city of Mariupol and those besieged in Azovstal, as well as the provocative-triumphal conclusion of President Volodymyr Zelensky posted on Facebook and Twitter - contributed to this. ""Our courage impressed the world, our music conquered Europe!"" -, supplemented by the promise of hosting the next edition of Eurovision in the city of Mariupol conquered by the Russians. Russia's response, excluded from the competition, came immediately in the form of photographs with threatening messages dated ""May 14"" written on the projectiles intended for Ukraine, with which it is believed that the Azovstal plant was bombed that very night. A few hours before , Iulia Vitiazeva, a journalist from Russia, requested on Twitter that the entire Eurovision show in Turin be blown up with a ""Satan"" missile, one of the most modern Russian nuclear weapons. It was followed by a furious online campaign by Kremlin propagandists, who posted on social networks images from the Eurovision contest illustrating the Ukrainian and Polish fascist faces. Several photos suggest that the artists from ""Kalush"" would have celebrated their victory by addressing the audience with the Nazi salute. The same Nazi salute is also attributed to the Polish actress Ida Novakovska, who announced the jury's scores live from Poland. The Reuters agency dismantled the forgeries, proving with images from different angles that the incriminated gestures were in fact either an enthusiastic wave of the hand or the consecrated sign of victory with the fingers in the shape of a ""V"". On the other hand, the pro-Russian hackers subjected the contest organizers to a massive cyber attack. The special department of the Italian police announced that it repelled several attacks by the ""Killnet"" and ""Legion"" groups both during the shows and during the voting, identifying the geographic location of the hackers.

In reality, it is not about any mobilization; Ukraine only requested assistance to be able to support its security forces, which together have a force of one million people.
NEWS: The Ambassador of the Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) in Russia, Rodion Mirosnik, wrote on his Telegram channel about Ukraine's plans to mobilize a million people. Mirosnik linked Kiev's intention to call for a million soldiers to the US's desire to provide the Ukrainian side with $40 billion in aid, as well as financial assistance from Europe.
According to him, since the United States and Great Britain invest weapons, ammunition and money in the crisis in Ukraine, Kiev is obliged to pay with human beings. ""The United States and its allies have increased the amount of aid, Kiev must respond with a million soldiers!"" he explained.
The LNR ambassador added that the Ukrainian authorities are indifferent to their country, because they will not live in it.
NARRATIVE: Kiev mobilizes a million people in the army, paying with human beings for Western loans
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Ukraine has not announced that it will mobilize a million soldiers. The propaganda narrative is based on an intentional misinterpretation of the statement of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksii Reznikov, who said that the Ukrainian army needs support, equipment, food and more. ""It is necessary to provide the necessary things to the one million people who are fighting the enemy,"" said the head of the Ukrainian army.
The minister did not talk about mobilization, but only about the high expenses for the operation of the army. At the beginning of May, Oleksii Reznikov declared that over a million people are already active in the Ukrainian defense and security sector. He explained that the respective figure includes all employees, volunteers and collaborators of the armed forces, territorial defense units, the police, the national guard, the security service, etc. Being a fairly large number of people, Kiev faced certain difficulties in terms of supplying them with the necessary things (helmets, bulletproof vests, clothes).
Therefore, the narrative launched by the Russian press, according to which Ukraine is going to mobilize a million soldiers in response to Western financial assistance, is false. On the contrary, Kiev requests support from the West to support the efficient functioning of its defense forces, mobilized on February 24 following the war launched by Russia against Ukraine.
The Russian press also claims that ""the Ukrainian authorities are indifferent to their country, because they will not live in it"". The thesis is not supported by any argument or evidence. Moreover, it is contradicted by the reality on the ground - even when Kiev was in danger, the leadership of Ukraine refused to leave their city, even though it was directly targeted by Russian forces.

""Schools continue to be attacked and used for military purposes. Educational institutions throughout the country were hit by heavy artillery, they were subjected to airstrikes [...]"", Abdi said at a meeting of the UN Security Council.
According to the diplomat, schools are used as information centers, shelters, supply centers or for military purposes.
[...] Ukrainian militants and foreign mercenaries place their reference centers and weapons in educational institutions in the Ukrainian regions of Vinnitsa and Kharkiv"".
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian military bombards schools or uses them for offensive purposes.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the UNICEF representative at the UN did not criticize Ukraine and did not accuse it of bombing its own schools or turning them into bridgeheads for launching offensives. In Omar Abdi's report, it is said that following the Russian aggression, Ukrainian families ended up ""in a real hell"", and the children had to drink water from puddles, hide from tanks and bombardments.
The UN report claims that Ukrainian schools are attacked by the Russian army, in eastern Ukraine every 6th educational institution was destroyed. For this reason, education will not be able to be resumed too soon.
The Russian press did not mention anything about the accusations against Russia, but created a propaganda narrative by taking some of Omar Abdi's statements out of context. The UN expert does not blame Ukraine, but only Russia for the humanitarian catastrophe and war crimes.
The same arguments were used by the head of the UN, Antonio Guterres, who declared during the meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia started a real war against Ukraine under the pretext of its ""denazification"" and ""disarmament"", rejecting the arguments about the ""operation special"". This is also the position of the UN General Assembly, which condemned Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Veridica has already dismantled a propaganda narrative, according to which Vladimir Putin convinced the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, that the Ukrainian Nazis should be tried at the Criminal Court International.
Also, according to another propaganda narrative dismantled by Veridica and launched at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kiev deploys its soldiers in schools and hospitals, and Russia is forced to attack them wherever they are. Publication / Media:

In this context, we ask the Government, as a matter of urgency, to approve: a regulation according to which the free public transport trips in the municipality of Chisinau, for the 13 categories of state employees, should be compensated from the state budget. At the same time, a regulation should be approved regarding enterprises of social importance"", said Alexandr Odintov. NARRATIVE: The pro-European PAS government (Maia Sandu) bears the responsibility for all price increases, including those expected for public transport in the city of Chisinau (led by a former socialist leader).
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: The Republic of Moldova records the highest inflation in Europe - 27% in April, and the situation will continue to worsen, so that inflation will exceed 30% in the fall, according to the latest forecasts of the National Bank. The governor of the National Bank of Romania, Octavian Armasu, explained this by the large share in the consumption basket of food products, the price of which has increased a lot, but also by the fact that many tariffs have not been adjusted in time, and their increase currently contributes to the increase in inflation .
At the beginning of last week, the mayor of Chisinau, Ion Ceban, one of the former leaders of the Socialist Party and a critic of the government, announced that public transport fares will be increased 2-3 times, given that the last adjustment was made in 2009, and in the meantime, the prices of energy resources have increased and the municipality is suffering big losses.
One of the theses intensively promoted by the pro-Russian opposition in the Republic of Moldova is that the pro-European government, led by president Maia Sandu and the Action and Solidarity Party (PAS), is responsible for the price increase.
OBJECTIVE: To associate the pro-European government with galloping inflation and price increases in the chain.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Fuel prices are rising practically all over the world. It is a trend that started in the second half of 2021 in the context of the relaunch of the economy after the Coronovaris pandemic, which was amplified at the beginning of 2022, in the context of the war in Ukraine.
At the beginning of last week, according to specialized websites, gasoline and diesel in the Republic of Moldova were among the cheapest in Europe, costing approximately 1.4 euros per liter.
In the Republic of Moldova, gasoline and diesel prices are set daily (on working days) by the National Agency for Energy Regulation, and four of the five members of the institution's Board of Directors were appointed according to the previous governments.
The government partially subsidized gas and thermal energy bills during the cold period of the year for all consumers, including thanks to the money offered by the European Union.
Regarding the transport tariffs in Chisinau, experts say that they should have been gradually increased over the years, something that was not done because of political interests.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The prices of energy resources have increased a lot in the last year, the period that also coincides with the mandate of the current government from Chisinau. Publication / Media:

The narratives aim to discredit the government in Chisinau because it spoke out against the war in Ukraine and banned its symbols.
NEWS: ""May 9 was widely celebrated in Moldova, despite the prohibition of symbols of Victory by the country's pro-European leadership. The celebration took place in all cities, but the most numerous manifestation was in Chisinau. The residents of the Capital carried out the ""Immortal Regiment"" march, organized a motorcade with victory flags and until night fell they took flowers to the eternal fire in memory of the fallen heroes in the Great War for the defense of the homeland. May 9 demonstrated that between the current authorities and the majority of citizens, an ideological chasm has formed that may soon lead to popular protests.
This year's Victory Day celebration fully demonstrated the previously observed trend, but which has now become even more impertinent and cynical. If previously it was possible to observe a gradual exaggeration of the merit of the Western states in defeating the Third Reich, today we can already see attempts to identify Russia with the Nazi regime.
Currently, power in Moldova is held by politicians who do not hide their support for Kiev, despite the fact that the country's neutral status is stipulated in the constitution. Victory Day was the touchstone that showed to what extent the numerous NGOs, which hide under the phrase ""civil society"", managed to change the mentality of the people.
We must say that the Moldovans passed this test with honor. Moreover, we can say that the Victory march in Moldova was the biggest in recent years. For this we must say thank you to the power, which did everything to prevent the people's celebration.
[...]
Victory Day in Moldova highlighted the rupture and chasm that separates the power from the majority of the population.
This fracture in the ideological and geopolitical spheres, as well as the economic condition of the population, can create real premises for mass protests. Those of you who went out to the Victory Day celebration, are you ready to go out to protest against the current government? The impression is created that the answer to this question will be more and more decided"".
NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European government does not respect the neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova; 2. Between the population of the Republic of Moldova and the pro-European government there is an ideological and geopolitical gulf that will cause massive protests; 3 The pro-European leadership tried to prevent the celebration of May 9.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to show a decrease in support for the Chisinau government because it spoke out against the war in Ukraine and banned the symbols used by the Russians in this war.
CONTEXT: The holiday of May 9 is a Soviet tradition, which marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 and in which the Soviet army is glorified. The demonstrations are organized every year by pro-Russian parties from the Republic of Moldova, and they are attended by party representatives and sympathizers, veterans, elderly people, mostly Russian speakers. This year, led by the socialist and communist leaders, former presidents Vladimir Voronin and Igor Dodon, the demonstrators marched from the center of Chisinau to the memorial of Soviet heroes, waving red flags and singing Soviet war songs. Many of the demonstrators, especially politicians, wore the black-orange bicolor ribbon on their chests, one of the symbols of the Russian-Ukrainian war recently banned in the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Many Bessarabians fought and died in the Second World War, some enlisted in the Soviet Army, others in the Romanian Army, or in both armies. While for a part of the Moldovan society, nostalgic for the Soviet times, generally old people, veterans of the Soviet Army, Russian speakers, people who occupied good positions during the Soviet period, this date represents a celebration, for another part of the society, of orientation pro-European, including pro-Romanian, on May 9 is Europe Day. The government in Chisinau marked on May 9 the Day of Europe and Peace, commemorating the victims of the Second World War, it did not ban opposition demonstrations, only the symbols associated with the war in Ukraine.
The statement regarding the gap between the Moldovan society and the pro-European government is speculative. The governing PAS party and its president Maia Sandu were supported by a vote of the population of the Republic of Moldova, obtaining a majority in the 2020 presidential and 2021 parliamentary elections. The erosion of confidence in the PAS government is a normal phenomenon, which affects the several formations in power. The economic situation is the one that most affects the way a government is viewed, and that of PAS has already been affected by multiple crises - the pandemic, the gas crisis, the war in neighboring Ukraine and the wave of refugees generated by it.
The May 9 demonstrations did not have a scale, in Chisinau or at the national level, that would suggest a massive mobilization of the population in favor of this celebration; it was rather a relatively modest action by the opposition parties, which also brought their sympathizers from outside Chisinau.
As for the narrative that the Chisinau authorities do not respect the principle of neutrality of the Republic of Moldova established in the Constitution, this is false. Article 11 provides that the Republic of Moldova is a neutral state and does not allow the deployment of military troops of other states on its territory, but does not prohibit the condemnation of wars or other military actions. The authorities of the Republic of Moldova have condemned the war in Ukraine, and the country currently hosts almost 100 thousand Ukrainian refugees. On the other hand, this principle of neutrality of the Republic of Moldova is violated by the Russian Federation, which illegally maintains Russian troops in the Transnistrian area.

It is the latest fake news in the cycle of those regarding the occupation of western Ukraine by Russia.These fit into the meta-narratives regarding Western meddling in the war and the artificial - and therefore unstable - nature of the Ukrainian state.
NEWS: ""The leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ordered the state border service to allow 4 Polish battalions to enter the country on May 22, according to the Telegram channel of military correspondent Iuri Koteniuk, which quotes a document sent by the military department to head of Ukrainian customs.
The document says that a Lithuanian-Polish pacification contingent must be allowed to enter from Poland. Between May 22-24, the border will be crossed by 9,500 soldiers and 279 units of military equipment. ""Another confirmation of the development of plans for the occupation and division of the state"", writes the Russian journalist.
At the same time, Koteniuk does not rule out that the document may be fake, but he specified that such an order anyway corresponds to the ""Western plan to occupy and loot"" Ukraine.
NARRATIVES: 1. Kiev allowed 10 thousand soldiers from Poland and Lithuania to enter the country. 2. Poland is going to annex part of Ukraine. 3. (indirectly) Ukraine is an artificial state.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The narrative in question is based on a document published on the Telegram channel of the Russian journalist Iuri Koteniuk, in which it is written that about 10 thousand soldiers from Poland and Lithuania, together with equipment and technology, have the right to enter in Ukraine between May 22-24, following the occupation of some territories of the Ukrainian state.
A simple analysis of the text written in Ukrainian is enough to notice a series of grammatical and punctuation mistakes. For example, the word Ukraine is written with two ""i""s, while in the Ukrainian language there is another letter that replaces this double ""i"" sound. The name of the customs office through which the four battalions of pacifists from Poland and Lithuania will enter Ukraine is also misspelled. This fact suggests that the document is fake.
Even the Russian journalist does not insist on the fact that the document is necessarily truthful, saying that this does not matter: ""Such an order anyway corresponds to the Western plan to occupy and loot Ukraine"".
Therefore, even if it is a fake document and even if the author himself admits that the argumentation could be rigged, this does not mean that the conclusion of the press article must be changed!
In fact, the propaganda narrative is a continuation of other propaganda messages distributed by the Russian press or spoken by Moscow officials.
Veridica has already written about 2 false narratives, according to which the President of Poland admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories after the head of Russian espionage, Sergei Nariskin, declared that Poland will take control of its ""historical territories"" in Ukraine with the help of the US.
Also, the Russian government press and Telegram channels, which are increasingly popular in the post-Soviet space, recently published a document signed by a Polish general regarding the annexation of western Ukraine. The Main Directorate of the Armed Forces of Poland announced to the public that it is a fake news and a forged document.
The press and politicians in Russia are trying to manipulate public opinion, demonstrating that the efforts of Poland and Lithuania to support Ukraine's defensive actions are aimed at annexing territories of the Ukrainian state. Publication / Media:

The narrative is promoted by former criminal convict Sorin Rosca Stanescu, known for his points of view similar to those of Russian propaganda. The latter has been promoting the idea of ​​starting a nuclear conflict for some time, in order to make the West stop supporting Ukraine.
NEWS: ""On May 9, through the speech delivered on the occasion of the military parade in Red Square, Vladimir Putin announced the outbreak of the Third World War. In unequivocal terms. He explained that the Russian Federation has been subjected to a military assault by NATO states for a long time. The gateway being Ukraine. Reason for which he was forced to start a preventive war. In his view, Ukraine is the first scene of a global conflict. Russia against NATO. And NATO against Russia [...] Only that NATO is not fighting alone in this war, defined by Vladimir Putin. We are actually dealing with a coalition made up of no less than 40 states. NATO states and non-NATO states [...] Yesterday, President Joe Biden, seemingly confirming Vladimir Putin's statement, signed an extremely important decree. The story of the Second World War is basically being repeated. According to this decree, the White House has the right to decide - and has already decided - substantial transfers of military equipment to Ukraine [...] In a world war, everything is thrown into play. And, obviously, the most efficient military arsenal. For the first time since the start of the aggression against Ukraine, from a technical point of view, the engines of the army of the Russian Federation show serious signs of catching the flu. Starting with even the most powerful rockets. Russia has detonated so many missiles in Ukraine that it no longer has the capacity to replace the most efficient ones. The most efficient are the guided missiles. Those that have the ability to hit at a fixed point. The guidance heads are made up of electronic components which, following the embargo imposed on the Russian Federation, are currently missing from the warehouses of the war industry [...] Without these components, the factories slow down or even stop their manufacturing rhythms. The whole war machine can catch the flu sooner or later. And sooner or later, the measures taken by the European Union will have their say, dramatically reducing and then completely blocking the imports of oil and gas from the Russian Federation, which until now have even financed the war machine at a sustained rate under the command of Vladimir Putin [...] The consequence is that, gradually running out of other means to bring this war to an end, which the Russian Federation considers not only preventive, but also vital for its survival, Putin is becoming more and more more tempted to use its nuclear arsenal. Through tactical and then strategic strikes. It will be the moment when, inevitably, NATO will also be forced to press the nuclear button [...] Consequently, the Kremlin leader announced as explicitly as possible that the Russian Federation is engaged in a world war of defense against NATO aggression and has increasingly indicated that it will use its nuclear arsenal when Russia's vital interests are threatened. Which, here, is happening."" NARRATIVES: 1. Russia will be forced to use the nuclear arsenal, because it will have no alternatives 2. Russia is fighting in Ukraine, in fact, with NATO. 3. Russia is in a preventive war of defense against NATO aggression.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Ever since the beginning of the war, Vladimir Putin has suggested that he could resort to nuclear weapons if any foreign power intervenes in support of Ukraine and has put his strategic forces on alert. Later, several Russian officials refused to explicitly reject the idea that Russia will use nuclear weapons, stating only that the circumstances in which strategic weapons are used are provided for in the country's military doctrine.
While the officials preferred ambiguity, television and their guests did not shy away from talking about the imminence of a nuclear war.
""United Russia Party deputy, Evgheni Popov, seconded by Olga Skabeeva, the host of the show ""60 minutes"" from Rossia 1, held a dialogue on April 27:
<<We are talking about Sarmat missiles... The question is: ""Can they stop them? This missile cannot be intercepted! Their possibilities are limited. They say they can shoot them down. We will see!""
Olga Skabeeva: <<From Kaliningrad, a ""Sarmat"" [missile] needs 106 seconds to reach Berlin. To hit Paris, 200 seconds. Say from London... 202 seconds.>>"".
In the same evening, Margarita Simonian, the editor-in-chief of Russia Today, invited on the show of Vladimir Solovyov, one of the most vocal media propagandists of the Kremlin, said that between the loss of the war in Ukraine and the start of a new World War, Russia has no to choose:
""I think that the version of a Third World War is the most realistic. Knowing us, knowing our leader Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, the hard-to-believe ending of everything ending with a nuclear strike seems more likely to me than any other development. On the one hand, I'm terrified, on the other, I'm thinking that... This is it!""
Likewise, another prominent propagandist of the Kremlin, Dmitri Kiseliov, in one of the news programs of Rossia 1 spoke about the devastating effects that a nuclear missile launched from Russia towards Great Britain would have. He said that Britain would be swallowed up forever by a devastating tsunami.
Sorin Rosca Stanescu, journalist-politician who served a prison sentence after being convicted, among other things, for ""forming an organized criminal group"", frequently promotes false narratives similar/identical to those issued by Russian propaganda.
OBJECTIVES: Intimidation of the West in order to deter it from supplying arms to Ukraine, given that Western armaments have helped Kiev's forces achieve remarkable results on the battlefield. Demoralizing and scaring the Ukrainian army. Perpetuating the myth of Russia's armed forces for the domestic public.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In his speech held on Monday in Red Square in Moscow, Russian leader Vladimir Putin did not say anything about a Third World War, as the author of the article, Sorin Rosca Stanescu, mentions.
The probability of using nuclear weapons is extremely low because even the detonation of a tactical nuclear bomb, with less impact, exponentially increases the risk of a nuclear war. As during the Cold War, it is not in anyone's interest to start a nuclear war, as this would involve the mutual destruction of the parties involved; no matter how large an attack launched by one of the camps would be to destroy the nuclear arsenal of the other, there are still enough missiles that will not be able to be stopped (for example, those on submarine fleets). Moreover, the destruction at the planetary level would be so great that even third countries - for example China - are directly interested in avoiding such a scenario at all costs.
The director of the US Intelligence Community, Avril Haines, said on Tuesday that Putin could flirt with the idea of ​​using nuclear weapons only if he sees an existential threat to his regime in Moscow.
""We think that [Putin's perception of an existential threat] could be the situation where he perceives that he is losing the war in Ukraine and that NATO, in fact, is either intervening or is about to intervene,"" Haines said.
She added that in this case there would probably be a warning that the use of nuclear weapons is imminent.
""There are a lot of things they would do in the context of escalation before reaching nuclear weapons,"" the head of the US Intelligence Community also said.
The same thing was mentioned on the same day by the Deputy Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alexaxandr Grusko, quoted by Reuters, namely that Russia could use such weapons only if it feels its existence threatened by conventional weapons, or if they are used against to weapons of mass destruction.
Also, Russia is not fighting with NATO in Ukraine, but with the Ukrainian army. The latter is helped with weapons by the international community to defend its own territory invaded by the Russian army at the moment and not to attack Russia.

The myth of Western military intervention in Ukraine
reuters.com / May 5, 2022, factandfurious.com / May 4, 2022
The forgeries intended to support the thesis launched by the Kremlin regarding the inherent direct foreign military intervention in support of Kiev are multiplying. A video with the BBC's graphic insignia, which claims to show Polish troops preparing for deployment to Ukraine, has been shared on social media in several languages, including Russian, English and French. The clip is accompanied by the image of a document attributed to the General Staff of the Polish Army, described as the battle preparation order intended for Polish airborne units that would enter the Lviv and Volyn regions to defend objectives in western Ukraine. The Reuters agency dismantled both mystifications, combated as such by their alleged authors. The clip in question was not made or broadcast by the British company, being a digital counterfeit, and the Polish military authorities did not issue any order aimed at an intervention in Ukraine. Meanwhile, in France, several users have distributed online a document with the letterhead of the army, interpreting it as proof of the imminent general mobilization in view of the military involvement of Paris in the war. In reality, the document is part of the periodic re-employment offers that the French Ministry of Defense makes to reservists who have been active in the army.
Propaganda without borders: hoaxes with ""Ukrainian refugees""
observers.france24.com / May 6, 2022
The demonization of Ukrainian citizens promoted by the Kremlin's propaganda services knows no bounds. The site of the Observatorii program of the France 24 channel has recently identified three cases of intoxication of public opinion from European countries with the common theme being the discrediting of Ukrainian refugees. A photo of a man wearing a T-shirt with the insignia of the Ukrainian Azov battalion was distributed by the Russian embassy with the explanation that the public display of Nazi symbols would have angered the locals. In reality, the man in the picture is Latvian and declared that he is wearing the shirt as a sign of support for the Ukrainian fighters. A video with more than 70,000 views on Twitter, distributed with the pretense that it captures the assault of a Jew in Belgium by a Ukrainian refugee, proved deceptive: the police in Antwerp declared that the aggressor was a Belgian of Ukrainian nationality in a state of intoxication and the incident was not had antisemitic connotations. Another photograph representing a woman on the beach showing off her tattoos with Nazi symbols, described as a Ukrainian refugee in Spain, is actually an image captured in July 2021 in Odessa, when a tourist of unknown nationality had to withdraw after what his presence aroused indignation.
""Victory Day"": dissent in the pro-Kremlin press
lenta.ru / May 9, 2022, meduza.io / May 9, 2022
While on May 9 Vladimir Putin was walking in Red Square, trying to draw a parallel between today's Russian aggression against Ukraine and the anti-Nazi Soviet victory in the Second World War, the website of one of the most active publications pro-Kremlin was interspersed with virulent articles against the war and the president of the Russian Federation. For a short time, on the Lenta.ru page, headlines unimaginable in the censored press could be read, such as ""Vladimir Putin has become a pathetic and paranoid dictator"", ""Putin unleashed one of the bloodiest wars of the 20th century XXI"" or ""Russia threatens to destroy the whole world"". Other articles lamented the military situation, the cynicism and incompetence of the army leadership: ""Russia abandons its fallen soldiers in Ukraine"", ""The Minister of Defense lied to the relatives of the dead soldiers on the cruiser"". ""Moskva"" or ""Russia, destroyed at Mariupol"". Some texts criticized the internal situation, accusing the authorities of using the invasion of Ukraine to mask economic bankruptcy, denouncing the censorship imposed on the press and stating the cowardice of Russia's elites. The least flattering for the Russian president is the headline that decrees that ""Zelensky is stronger than Putin"". The articles, quickly replaced by the site's administrators, but kept in the Internet's memory, were posted by Egor Poliakov, the head of the economic section of of the Lenta publication, and Alexandra Mirosnikova, a journalist at the same department, who replaced about 20 news items praising the Kremlin with their own texts accompanied by the statement that they were not authorized by the newspaper's management. Poliakov told the Meduza publication that he and his colleague did not are in Russia at the moment and that they are both looking for a job, lawyers and a country that will grant them political asylum.

The propaganda narrative, which was distributed by the Russian press, misrepresents the content of a decision of the Main Directorate of Espionage of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
NEWS: Members of the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church are considered enemies of Ukraine, ""preachers of the genocide of the Ukrainian people"", according to the Main Directorate of Espionage of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
Every metropolitan, archbishop and bishop in Russia is wanted, according to the Main Directorate of Espionage. In Ukraine, priests will be punished, according to the laws of the state of war, says the head of the Main Directorate of Espionage, Kirilo Budanov. The Kiev authorities have also established a punishment for bishops from Russia - execution by firing squad.
[...]
In the component of the Russian Orthodox Church is also the Ukrainian Orthodox Church which belongs to the Patriarchate of Moscow, led by the Metropolitan of Kiev Onufrie (Berezovsky). He was not sentenced to death as an ""enemy of Ukraine"" because he spoke out against Russia's special operation on the territory of Ukraine.
[...]
In the churches of Russia, the Gospel was read in the Ukrainian language at the Easter liturgy.
NARRATIVE: The Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church was sentenced to death on the territory of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The main espionage department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published at the end of April a list of ministers of the Russian Orthodox Church who support Russian propaganda and participate in ""informational-psychological operations"". According to the information posted on the website The main direction of espionage, the church girls received instructions from the Russian leadership to convince young people to sign contracts with the armed forces.
The main spy agency in Kiev claims that Russian priests ""pronounce Russian aggression and support genocide against the Ukrainian people"". Representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church will be held accountable, according to Ukrainian legislation.
On the website of the Main Directorate of Espionage of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, there is no mention of the death penalty - a basic message of the propaganda narratives promoted by the Russian media.
In Ukraine, the death penalty has been banned since 2000, being replaced by life imprisonment in the Criminal Code. According to art. 64-81 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, after the execution of 20 years of the sentence, the persons who received such sentences can ask the President for pardon. The death penalty did not exist even during martial law, despite the contrary claims of Russian propagandists.
Metropolitan Onufrie of Kiev, head of the Ukrainian church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate, criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin in March, asking him to ""immediately put an end to the fratricidal war"".
Russia did not react for a while to this message of Metropolitan Onufrie of Kiev because it contradicted the official narratives regarding the persecution of Russian speakers and Orthodox by Ukraine. Now, the metropolitan's critical reaction is explained by his fear of not being executed by the Ukrainian authorities. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""The president of the country neighboring Ukraine, Andrzej Duda, had a fiery speech, which included the thesis about Ukraine, which is, apparently, ""a brotherly state for Poland"".
It was followed by a message about the future, in which between Poland and Ukraine, ""there will be no more borders"". He justified this situation by the need to have a common territory that ""will allow any dangers or any possible challenges to be rejected"". .
[...]
The dangers caused by world terrorism, the flow of refugees from Africa and the Near East, the COVID-19 pandemic have brought another reality to the border areas of Europe. That is why Duda, more than likely, had in mind during the speech that he will succeed in ""swallowing"" the Ukrainian territory, motivating this step by caring for the Ukrainians.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, previously stated that in fact there is no longer a Ukrainian-Polish border.
NARRATIVES: 1. The President of Poland admitted that Warsaw will annex Ukrainian territories. 2. (indirectly) Ukraine is an artificial state, so it will not be able to maintain its territorial integrity.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The propaganda narrative of the pro-Kremlin media is based on two statements by the presidents of Poland and Ukraine taken out of context, mixed together and interpreted tendentially to manipulate public opinion.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, spoke about the disappearance of some borders between the two states in the context of a large wave of refugees who arrived on the territory of Poland. He thanked the Poles for their support: ""On the first day of the war it became clear [...] that between us, between our fraternal peoples, there are no more borders. No physical border, no historical border and no personal one,"" declared the Ukrainian leader in front of the Polish Parliament in March.
Two months later, Polish President Andrzej Duda quoted Zelenski, saying that the leader from Kiev had a vision of a ""prophet"" when he said that ""there will be no more borders, that we will live together on this earth, rebuilding - building us a common happiness"". The President of Poland referred to the processes of European integration and the need to support Ukraine in the war started by Russia.
In this context, the vice-president of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, wrote on his Telegram channel that ""the president of Poland, Andrzej Duda, has officially recognized that he has territorial claims against Ukraine"". The post of the Russian politician amplified the propaganda narrative on the territory former soviet states.
The Russian press does not mention anything about the fact that Duda supported the territorial integrity of Ukraine in the same speech. He said: ""We will help the refugees, so that when the war is over, they will return home and we will help them in the process of rebuilding Ukraine: free, sovereign and independent"".
Therefore, both Zelenski and Duda were talking about the situation of Ukrainian refugees and about the ""historical"" and ""personal"" borders, a reference to the need to overcome the dissensions of the past. At the same time, Zelenski also referred to Ukraine's European path, which, in the case of joining the EU, would benefit from free movement and the common market, which, practically, would be equivalent to the elimination of controls at the borders between the two countries, as is happening and in the case of other member states. Therefore, Duda did not talk about territorial claims against Ukraine, nor did Zelenski refer to such a subject.
The narrative in question is a continuation of some propaganda messages, released in the public space by the head of Russian espionage, Sergey Nariskin, who declared that ""he has information about the plans of Warsaw and Washington to install a military-political control over the historical Polish territories in Ukraine "". Veridica has already dismantled this false narrative, which aims to demonstrate to public opinion in Russia that the ""special military operation"" of the Kremlin is necessary and that several states would participate in the division of Ukraine in the future.
Poland was the most vocal and active of all Ukraine's neighbors in terms of combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts, becoming a target of Russian propaganda.
As for the artificial nature of Ukraine, the narratives are contradicted by the realities on the ground - the entire population of the country, regardless of ethnicity or region, opposes the Russian invasion and many Ukrainians are involved in the war effort either by fighting or through other activities supporting the armed forces or refugees.

NEWS: ""It is rumored that Romanian soldiers in Moldovan uniforms have been in the territory of the Republic of Moldova for several months.
This is not really related to military neutrality, which the Moldovan authorities talk about tirelessly. This neutrality is just a fiction. Fuel has long been transported to Ukraine on the railway of Moldova [...] It is very possible that soon, weapons from the West will be added to the fuel.
[...]
It is clear that the West is proposing to Moldova the Ukrainian version of European integration: without formal accession to the EU and NATO, but with strong military arsenals. In this way, the small country will have the role of a living shield against Russia"" NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European authorities of the Republic of Moldova violate the neutrality status of the country. 2 The West is pushing the Republic of Moldova towards a war with Russia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is often seen as Russia's next target after Ukraine. An important Russian-speaking minority lives here (approximately 20% of the population), and a separatist region de facto controlled by Moscow has formed in the East. The pro-European authorities led by President Maia Sandu are often criticized by Moscow and the pro-Russian opposition in Chisinau for undermining the rights of Russians and Russian speakers, but also for their pro-Western position.
Concerns increased after the statements of Russian Major General Rustam Minnekaev. He claimed that during the second stage of the military operations in Ukraine, the Russian army would intend to take control over the Donbas, but also the south of Ukraine, including up to the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, where the rights of the Russians would be violated.
In this context, accusations about the violation of the neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova by the current authorities, but also by the West and NATO, have also increased, and it would seem that reasons are being sought to launch a ""special operation"" on the Republic of Moldova as well , an economically, militarily and geographically vulnerable state.
OBJECTIVE: To accuse the authorities and the West of violating the statute of neutrality, enshrined in the Constitution, in order to justify a possible attack against the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Chisinau condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but did not join the Western sanctions against the Russian Federation.
The Republic of Moldova received Ukrainian refugees, and over 90,000 are still on its territory, but it did not offer military support to Ukraine and refused to sell the 6 MIGs it still has and does not use .
Lately, the thesis that Romania has sent or intends to send soldiers to the Republic of Moldova has also been persistently promoted, claims denied by the Defense Ministries of the two states.
At the same time, there is no basis for the claims that the West would push the Republic of Moldova towards a war with Russia, or that it would intend to attack the Transnistrian separatist region. The President of the EC, Charles Michel, promised that the EU will provide support for strengthening the army of the Republic of Moldova, but the EU is not a defensive alliance, like NATO, and the support only concerns the strengthening of the defense capacity of the Republic of Moldova in the face of challenges from the Transnistria area. Regardless of the nature of that support, it is unlikely that in the foreseeable future the Republic of Moldova could become a military threat to Russia or even to Transnistria. In addition, the status of neutrality continues to benefit from the support of a large part of the population and in Chisinau the abandonment of this status was never seriously discussed, the idea appearing rather in the speeches of the pro-Russian opposition who launch false narratives regarding the abandonment of neutrality in order to had electoral benefits.

282,785,Ukrainians are Satanists,Ukrainian Nazi soldiers practice satanic rituals,False,[],"['Ukrainians', 'Satanists']",,,,,,,,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-ucrainenii-sunt-satanisti,,08.05.2022,,,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/propaganda-de-razboi-ucrainenii-sunt-satanisti,,"The Ukrainian military practices satanic rituals so that the forces of darkness help them in battles, writes the Russian news agency Ria Novosti. The narrative aims to demonize the opponent, the Ukrainian army.
NEWS: ""At the headquarters of the Ukrainian artillery command near the town of Trehizbenka, traces of black magic were detected: followers of forces from the other world tried to ""sanctify"" their weapons and left traces of blood, reports the correspondent of RIA Novosti .
Military unit A4472 was located in that headquarters. The Satanist seal was noticed on the walls, reminiscent of Hollywood movies about unclean forces.
""It is a magical symbol, made of several intersecting lines. It is difficult to say what this symbolizes, here you can see the inverted anarchist symbol, part of the SS symbol, the Sieg rune, clearly visible on the left side of the circle, and the Hebrew letter Zein, written in German, which means ""sword"" or ""the weapon"", said culturologist Ecaterina Dais for RIA Novosti. It is ""the magic seal of the forces of darkness,"" she added.
She noticed that the symbol consisted of a continuous line, which also demonstrates its occult character. ""In biblical Hebrew, Zein means ""sword"" and the verb ""lezein"" means ""weapon"". They probably did a ritual to strengthen their weapons or ""asked for more weapons"". consider Dais.
Among the command's instructions, in the building, was found a communique of Ukrainian fighters in which they recounted the losses suffered in Donbass. Traces of blood were found on the document, a fact that has not been observed in other cases"".
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian Nazi military practices satanic rituals to help them in battle.
OBJECTIVE: The narrative aims to demonize the opponent.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: One of the main narratives promoted by the Kremlin to justify the invasion of Ukraine is that the country must be denazified; moreover, ever since it attacked Ukraine for the first time, in 2014, Russia has denounced the presence of so-called fascist elements in the neighboring country. This narrative is also supported by fake news that refer to mysticism and occult rituals, which the Ukrainian military would practice, with reference to the interest in occultism of some Nazi leaders, especially from the SS.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russian propaganda has resorted to various stories, especially about the Ukrainian soldiers from the Azov battalion. The Russian press writes that the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Mariupol would worship the statue of the god of lightning Perun, but also other Scandinavian deities (under the influence of far-right Europeans), that they would practice various rituals, from the witches' sabbath, to the traditions of American special forces soldiers. Russian television also reported that a group of American soldiers, ""Satan's mercenaries"", would fight in Ukraine. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion in 2022, video clips appeared on social networks - later dismantled as fakes - in which characters dressed in uniforms military and who present themselves as fighters of the Azov battalion would have crucified a young man. The most famous fake news of this kind was the one about the crucifixion of a child, which appeared back in 2014, when Russia started the war in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine .
Claims regarding the connection between the Ukrainian forces, the extreme right and the occult were made recently - and widely taken up by Russian channels - also by Lara Logan, the journalist and war correspondent associated in recent years with the promotion of conspiracy theories and false information, which led to her dismissal by several media organizations, including Fox News, which does not always distance itself from such theories.
The fake news about Satanism refers, indirectly, to the way in which Russia is positioned as an Orthodox Christian city under siege, a defender of traditional values ​​opposed to those that the Church denounces as sins.
The story with the satanic rituals shows, therefore, many similarities with other fake news spread in the last 8 years by Russian propaganda and, according to their pattern, does not present conclusive evidence. In addition, no independent source has found the existence of any Satanist current within the Ukrainian forces, neither after the launch of the large-scale Russian invasion, nor before it.

The false narrative was launched even by the spokesperson of the Russian Foreign Ministry, being multiplied by the Russian government press.
NEWS: In Ukraine, alongside the units of the ""Azov"" regiment (against the soldiers against whom a criminal case was filed in the Russian Federation), mercenaries from Israel are fighting, said the spokesperson of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova.
[...] The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that Israel cannot ignore this. ""I saw the video, the invoices, the materials"", explained Zaharova.
Previously, the Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, said that he expects an apology from Russia for the statement of his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to Israel, Anatoly Viktorov, was called to the Foreign Ministry to offer explanations. On Sunday, Lavrov, in an interview given to the Italian television company ""Mediaset"", said that a nazification process is taking place in Ukraine and the captured soldiers of the nationalist battalions wear tattoos with neo-Nazi symbols. At the same time, Lavrov underlined to the question, the words of Volodymyr Zelensky, who denies Nazism in his country, as he himself is a Jew. The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said that ""this means absolutely nothing"" because ""Jewish scholars say that the most ardent anti-Semites are, of usually, also Jews"".
NARRATIVE: Mercenaries from Israel fight in Ukraine against Russia alongside the soldiers of the ""Azov"" group
CONTEXT: After the start of Russia's war against Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky declared that an International Legion, composed of volunteers, would be established, which would support the defensive efforts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Kiev has announced that many Russian citizens have registered in this International Legion.
The Russian press wrote in the last 2 months that foreign mercenaries are fighting in Ukraine, discrediting Kiev's initiative to create a group of military volunteers. Veridica has already dismantled a false narrative, according to which the US will send former soldiers of the national army from Afghanistan to Ukraine. The Kremlin is looking for justifications in front of its own citizens, but also the international community, for the fact that Russia is the one that calls on mercenaries (Wagner group, Syrian fighters). At the same time, Moscow seeks to show that Ukraine's resistance is due to foreign support, not to its own military.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: After Israel apologized to Russia for the statement of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow, it became another target of propaganda and disinformation messages. In this sense, Moscow combined two previous false narratives: the one about the atrocities of the soldiers of the ""Azov"" regiment accused of being neo-Nazis, and another one about mercenaries from Israel fighting in Ukraine.
Russian propaganda deepened Lavrov's rather confused message by launching a much larger false narrative, according to which the Israeli military is fighting side by side with Ukrainian neo-Nazis! From here it would result that Jews and neo-Nazis fight against the Russian military in Ukraine, the image of Russia as a besieged fortress being strengthened in the eyes of public opinion.
In reality, Ukraine offered an exhaustive explanation regarding the status of the military who voluntarily fight on its territory according to international law. The MFA in Kyiv mentioned that these are foreign citizens in the Armed Forces of Ukraine based on voluntary agreements, according to the Geneva Convention of 1949. They are not remunerated and must enjoy fair treatment if they become prisoners of war. war.
In the Russian-language press of the Jewish community in Ukraine, images were even published of Jewish volunteers in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who are by no means professional mercenaries. Many of them are not even citizens of Israel.
Therefore, there are no foreign mercenaries on the territory of Ukraine, but volunteers, including Jews, Russians, and Belarusians, who signed up in the International Legion under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
Russia did not present any evidence about the presence of mercenaries from Israel in Ukraine or their collaboration with fighters from the ""Azov"" regiment; simply, the Russians claimed that there were certain invoices that would prove their claims, in a style reminiscent of numerous other propaganda campaigns based on fake news and disinformation.
In addition, Israel emphasized that it will not get involved in any way in the Russian-Ukrainian war, stating only that the majority of officials supported the need to increase the military and civilian support provided to Ukraine, arousing Moscow's displeasure. Israel is forced to be cautious by its national interests, given the fact that Russia is present in Syria, a country where the Israeli air force operates regularly to stop the formation of Iranian bases that threaten Israel's security. Russia has not interfered so far to prevent Israeli operations in Syria. On the other hand, there are also important economic ties between Israel and Russia, and part of the population of the former is originally from Russia. Publication / Media:

The nuclear mission of Kremlin spokesmen
smotrim.ru / Apr. 27 2022
The latest mission received by the propagandists loyal to Vladimir Putin seems to be to spread atomic terror among Western enemies. This could be the explanation of the invocation in less than a week, in three different programs broadcast by the most watched channel of the Russian state television, of the use of nuclear weapons as a decisive argument in the war in Ukraine. First, the deputy of the United Russia Party, Evgheni Popov, seconded by Olga Skabeeva, the host of the show ""60 minutes"" from Rossia 1:
<<We are talking about the Sarmat missiles... The question is: ""can they stop them? This missile cannot be intercepted! Their possibilities are limited. They say they can shoot them down. We will see!""
Olga Skabeeva: <<From Kaliningrad, a ""Sarmat"" (missile) needs 106 seconds to reach Berlin. To hit Paris, 200 seconds. Say from London... 202 seconds.>>
Evgheni Popov: <<We should show them this picture! Hey guys, do you see this picture? Count the seconds... Can you manage? Hey, the rocket is already there!"" Let's let them think a little... Put their hand on a timer and count 200 seconds! That's how you have to talk to them! That's the only way you get along with them!>>
On the same evening, Margarita Simonian, the editor-in-chief of Russia Today, guest on Vladimir Solovyov's show, said that between losing the war in Ukraine and starting a new World War, Russia has no choice:
""I think that the version of a Third World War is the most realistic. Knowing us, knowing our leader Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, the hard-to-believe ending of everything ending with a nuclear strike seems more likely to me than any other development. On the one hand, I'm terrified, on the other, I'm thinking that... This is it!""
Vladimir Solovyov: ""But we will get to Heaven... and they will punish.""
A few days later, Dimitri Kiseliov, a close friend of President Putin, presented in one of the news programs of Rossia 1 in an arrogant-ironic tone a clip with the devastating effects that a nuclear missile launched from Russia towards the Sea would have Britain.
<<The (British) islands are so small that one ""Sarmat"" missile is enough to sink them forever. Everything has already been calculated. One missile, Boris (Johnson), and England will no longer exist!>>
Russian propaganda offensive dedicated to ""Victory Day""
euvsdisinfo.eu / Apr. 28 2022
More than two months after the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian disinformation machine shows no signs of wear. On the contrary, the approach of May 9 - Europe Day for most of the continent's states, Victory Day in Moscow - has led to the mobilization of the Kremlin's propaganda resources so that the lack of expected progress on the front seems like a real victory. As a result, the media loyal to Putin are braving, presenting the unfulfilled wishes as successes of the so-called ""special operations"" which, according to Russian officials, entered the second phase on April 22, after the same officials announced on March 26 the end of the first phase of the operation. The immediate objective would be the full control of the Donbas region and the south of Ukraine, thus ensuring a land corridor to Crimea. The euvsdisinfo portal notes the return to the forefront of Russian disinformation of some already compromised narratives, such as that of provocations staged by enemies to then accuse the Russian military of using prohibited weapons. The revival without evidence of the theory of the manufacture of biological weapons in Ukraine with American support is an example. Moreover, for Russia, the tactic of accusing opponents of their own reprehensible deeds, such as the massacre of in Bucea, it is recurring. At the same time, the Kremlin's propaganda seems to be preparing the ground for potential military failures, insisting more and more on the thesis that Russia is only defending itself in the face of global aggression. Analysts note that, in this logic, it would not be surprising that in the following days we learn from the Russian press that the possible fall of the city of Mariupol is a substantial military success that confirms the achievement of the announced strategic objectives. The hypothesis is also supported by the distribution of several videos that have become viral that triumphantly present symbols reminiscent of the Soviet era, simultaneously with the removal of Ukrainian state insignia from the occupied areas. An image intended to awaken in the memory of Russians the patriotic feeling of the defense of Mother Russia, in accordance with the celebration of the victory against Nazi Germany on May 9.
Transnistria, on the agenda of Russian war propaganda
euvsdisinfo.eu / Apr. 28 2022; bbc.com / 28 Apr. 2022; mil.in.ua / May 1, 2022; apnews.com / Apr. 28 2022
For Russia, control of southern Ukraine would also mean access to Transnistria, the region of the Republic of Moldova whose self-declared independence is not internationally recognized. Moscow's interest in the junction with the separatist territory where 1,500 soldiers are stationed - recognized recently by an important official of the Russian army - puts the recent explosions in Transnistria in a worrying perspective. Kremlin officials accused Ukraine of the attacks, resuming the thesis of oppression of the Russian-speaking population, used as a pretext for the invasion of Ukraine. Western analysts, however, consider the version of the President of Moldova to be more plausible. Maia Sandu declared that the explosions that targeted the retransmission antennas of Russian radio stations and the headquarters of the Security Service in Tiraspol are actions of Transnistrian supporters of the war who want to destabilize the region. This version is also supported by the content of a newspaper called ""Transnistria"", dated May 2, but presented on May 1 by the Information Service of the Ukrainian Army. The publication includes a text entitled ""Official appeal of the citizens of Transnistria"", in which President Vladimir Putin is asked to integrate the Transnistrian troops into Russia's military actions in Ukraine. On the other hand, the Associated Press verified and proved as false a message attributed to the Ukrainian authorities in which they would have warned the Transnistrian population of an imminent attack. The document distributed on social networks in Russian, without date, signature or other identifying element, asked the inhabitants of the region to take shelter until 19:00, the time when the Ukrainian army would have bombed the military facilities in the area.

As in February 22-24, it is very likely that we will witness major events in the Republic of Moldova and in Transnistria [...] It is obvious that Transnistria should return to Ukraine (or to Poland in the end?), with the exception of Dubasari district and Tighina, Romanian lands. With all the ""western"" partnership in which Romania and Ukraine are today, Northern Bucovina and Transcarpathia (Historical Maramures) are Romanian provinces, inhabited once, respectively even today (Historical Maramures) by the majority of Romanians"", writes bursa.ro NARRATIVES: 1. Romania, Poland, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova will together attack the separatist Transnistrian region. 2. Russia did not want to invade Ukraine, but struck preventively, because Ukraine was going to attack the separatist regions of Donbass. 3. Poland wants to take control over some territories in western Ukraine. 4. Romania must recover lost territories from Ukraine.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Last week several incidents took place in Transnistria - unidentified assailants fired at the headquarters of the MGB secret service, considered by many analysts from Chisinau to be just a regional extension of the Russian FSB, aerials were blown up which they did not work, but previously they had transmitted the Russian TV and radio channels in Transnistria, etc. The attacks were not claimed, but their nature suggests that they could be false-flag operations against Russia. Other variants circulated in connection with the attacks attribute them to Ukraine or to the competition between groups from the separatist republic.
There are about 1,600 soldiers of the Russian army in the Transnistrian region, most of them local Transnistrians because the Republic of Moldova has not allowed the rotation of Russian soldiers in the region for many years. To them would be added, according to the figures circulated from Chisinau, a maximum of 8,000 militiamen from all the force structures of Transnistria.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the meta-narrative according to which Russia is the victim of Ukraine and the West, so that its war is a just one. Supporting the Russian propaganda thesis regarding the aggression of the West towards Moscow.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The author of the article does not mention any source for his statements, but the main narratives coincide with some launched by Russia over time - Romania's involvement in the war in Ukraine, the attack on Transnistria, the lack of viability of the Ukrainian state and its dismemberment in favor of the neighbors, NATO's participation in the war in Ukraine, the responsibility of the Alliance and the West in general for the conflict, etc.
Such a large combined effort of two NATO countries - Romania and Poland, plus Ukraine, which has very large military forces and is already well equipped with high-performance weaponry, would not be justified from a logistical and military point of view.
In the event of an attack, Romania and Poland can no longer be protected by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, so that they would no longer benefit from collective defense; therefore, there is no question of an operation involving all of NATO.
On the other hand, just last week the Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovichi, declared that the Ukrainian army can intervene alone and would liquidate the Russian and Transnistrian forces in the region ""with a snap of the fingers"". He said that the problem lies in the fact that the country should, from a legal point of view, actually attack the territory of the Republic of Moldova.
Therefore, in the scenario of an attack on Transnistria, Ukraine would not need the involvement of NATO states, and their involvement would not be equivalent to NATO entering the war on the side of Kiev.
The fact that Russia would have preemptively attacked Ukraine is a lie, because for a year, Russia brought to the borders of Ukraine and prepared for the attack. At the time of the invasion, Ukraine did not have so many troops - 60-80,000 soldiers - on the demarcation line with Donbass at the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24.
In the same vein, Ukraine has the legitimate right to recover the territories lost in 2014 to the separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk supported by another foreign state, namely Russia.
The threat from Russia is even greater, because we are talking about Russia, which on paper has the second largest army in the world and is a nuclear power.
Also, the recovery of territories by Poland in Ukraine is a recurring theme of Russian propaganda narratives. Poland is by far one of the most vocal countries regarding the Russian aggression in Ukraine and has sent consistent humanitarian and military support to this country. Also, Poland hosts about three million Ukrainian refugees since the beginning of the war.
finally, the idea of ​​recovering the territories inhabited by Romanians before the Second World War from Ukraine is also a thesis often invoked in the Russian propaganda narratives dismantled by Veridica. It relies on the revanchist feeling and the nationalism of the Romanians against the neighboring states that took territories that belonged to the Romanian state in history. Publication / Media:

In reality, the Tatars have opposed Russian aggression since 2014, when Moscow occupied and annexed Crimea.
NEWS: ""The Crimean Tatars have declared their full support for the foreign policy course of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, which aims to defend the sovereignty and ensure the security of Russia and its citizens, it is said in the call to the Assembly of Municipal Deputies and Representatives civil society. The National Assembly of the Crimean Tatars was held in Simferopol on Saturday. More than 300 representatives of Crimean Tatars participated.
,,[...] We are willing to participate as volunteers in the special operation in Ukraine. We believe in our leader, we believe in victory. Thank you for the clean and peaceful sky,"" the appeal states.
The participants in the meeting called Russia a leading state, with a very high economic and defensive potential, led by a strong and determined commander-in-chief.""
NARRATIVE: Crimean Tatars support Russia's military actions on the territory of Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, Crimean Tatars have repeatedly criticized the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation, condemning the annexation of the peninsula in 2014. Due to disobedience and protests, Crimean Tatars are politically persecuted, imprisoned, and a series of cultural associations were closed.
The Mejlis is the representative body of the Crimean Tatars, which functions according to the model of a parliament. After Crimea was occupied by Russia, the leaders of this national council began to be persecuted, and the president of the Mejlis, Refat Ciubarov, was forbidden to enter the territory of the peninsula.
The propaganda narrative launched by the pro-Kremlin media was criticized by Refat Ciubarov on his Facebook page. He mentioned that the Russian authorities forcibly gathered students of the Crimean University of Engineering and Pedagogy and employees of the education system who voted on a decision elaborated in the offices in Moscow.
""The sole purpose for which the FSB of the Russian Federation organized this gathering is to mimic the support of the Crimean Tatars for Putin's policy and the special operation against Ukraine. Through these actions, the Russian secret services are trying again, but without any results, to deceive the world, demonstrating that the Tatars are, in reality, loyal to the policy of the occupying state and to President Putin,"" stated Ciubarov.
The leader of the Crimean Tatars mentioned that Russia continues to persecute the representatives of the community it represents, replacing them with artificial assemblies and invented leaders.
On April 19, another Crimean Tatar leader, Emil Ziadinov, was sentenced to 17 years in prison, accused of organizing terrorist acts on the territory of the peninsula. The Mejlis considered this to be a fabricated file. Ukraine has repeatedly discussed the issue of human rights violations in the occupied peninsula at the UN.
It should be noted that the Russian propaganda narrative was launched after the Mejlis demanded at the end of March the return of the Crimean peninsula, calling it ""a mandatory condition"" in the peace negotiations with Russia.
""The Council of Crimean Tatars starts from the principle that the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine in its internationally recognized borders, including the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, must be a mandatory condition for the organization of official negotiations between Ukrainian representatives and the aggressor country, the Russian Federation "", according to the leader of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis.
Starting with 2014, the Tatars, along with other ethnic groups from Crimea, were recruited into the Russian armed forces. Veridica has already written that two notifications, signed by the NGO Crimean Human Rights Group, were sent to the Prosecutor's Office of the International Criminal Court. They contain evidence of the involvement of officials of the occupying state and its administration in organizing and carrying out illegal recruitment campaigns in the peninsula. The Russian authorities even opened 14 criminal cases in Crimea for evading civilians from military conscription. Publication / Media:

The filming - also used for other disinformation - is a pretext for resuming the thesis regarding Romania's intention to occupy the Republic of Moldova and attack the Transnistrian separatist region.
NEWS: ""Several Ukrainian media institutions have published a video in which it is mentioned that the movement of Romanian military equipment units to the borders with the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine is fixed.
The director of the Institute for Social-Political Research Igor Sornicov previously assumed that following the terrorist attacks in Transnistria, the Supreme Security Council [of the Republic of Moldova] would decide to send the Romanian army to the Republic of Moldova"", wrote gazeta.ru.
On the same day, topwar.ru publishes an image with a column of military equipment, mentioning that it could be the Romanian army heading towards the Republic of Moldova. The publication suggests that the aim of the Romanian army, as well as the Ukrainian one, is to attack the separatist Transnistrian region and occupy the Republic of Moldova.
""If we talk about Romania, it has its own interests in the region and it refers not only to Transnistria, but to all of Moldova"".
NARRATIVES: 1. Romania (NATO state) is involved in the war waged by Russia in Ukraine. 2. Romania is ready to violate the neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova. 3. Romania is preparing to attack Transnistria (where there are Russian soldiers and military equipment).
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is the most vulnerable state in South-Eastern Europe in the face of a potential Russian military aggression. In addition to its meager military capabilities, the Republic of Moldova has in its eastern part a separatist enclave controlled by Russia, where Russian military troops are stationed, which, officially, guard a warehouse with over 20,000 tons of ammunition left over from the Soviet era.
Chisinau, which condemned the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, announced that it will keep its status of neutrality. And the authorities of the separatist Transnistrian region, which proclaimed itself a republic at the beginning of the 1990s, announced that they would not intervene in the war. Kiev has referred several times to the dangers and challenges associated with the separatist regime in Tiraspol in the context of the war.
In the last week, several armed attacks were recorded in the region.
Tiraspol declared a code red terrorist alert and installed concrete blocks at the entrance to the cities.
Meanwhile, statements were released, picked up by the Russian press, about Romania's intention to militarily attack/occupy the Republic of Moldova.
OBJECTIVE: To present Romania as an aggressor state. To fuel the concerns of a part of the population of the Republic of Moldova and the Transnistrian region regarding the danger of a Romanian occupation. To justify a possible Russian military intervention in Transnistria (including the Republic of Moldova) to eliminate the danger of Romanian occupation.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The thesis about Romania's military equipment heading towards the borders with the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine starts from a video recording made by someone who was traveling by car and met a military column on the road. There is no indication as to the place or destination of the column.
Although the Russian press writes that the images are published by the Ukrainian press, they appeared on a telegram channel from Transnistria, called PMR_History, on April 27, and the next day they were picked up by telegram channels and press from Ukraine and Russia.
The column that appears in the recording does not even belong to the Romanian army - it is made up of vehicles of the American forces deployed in Romania.
Moreover, in parallel with the narratives regarding the movement of the Romanian forces towards the border, another appeared, according to which the Americans would be the ones who would move towards the border with the Republic of Moldova. The Romanian Ministry of Defense announced that the military technical units in the video images were, in fact, heading towards the Babadag training ground.
""We are reporting a new fake news, posted on various online platforms in Romania and in other countries, which accredits the idea that a convoy of American military vehicles would move from Romania to Ukraine.
In the footage on which this misinformation is based, military vehicles of the US Army do indeed appear. These are part of those deployed by the US 2nd Cavalry Regiment in the Mihail Kogalniceanu Base, at the beginning of this year"", it is stated in a denial published by the ministry on its Facebook page. According to it, ""Wednesday, April 27, the American vehicles, accompanied, according to national procedures, by special vehicles of the Military Police of the Romanian Army, moved to the Babadag Range in order to carry out previously planned shooting sessions with Romanian and allied soldiers.
The training activities carried out by the soldiers of the allied countries deployed in our country, within the measures to strengthen the security of the eastern flank of NATO, are current in nature, therefore, such columns of military equipment, not only belonging to the USA, but also to Belgium, France, Italy , Great Britain or Portugal will be able to be observed frequently during the journeys between the station bases and the joint training facilities"".
Both versions of the narrative are part of a real disinformation campaign, started before the Russian invasion on a large scale and continued after its onset, according to which they would try to attract Moldova to NATO or involve it in a conflict with Russia. Publication / Media:

It is the latest in a series of false narratives by which Moscow tries to attribute responsibility for war crimes committed by the Russian military to Ukraine.
NEWS: The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation announced that Ukraine is preparing a new challenge in Lisiansk. According to the representative of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the head of the National Defense Control Center, colonel-general Mihail Mizintev, the Ukrainian authorities are preparing another terrible challenge in Lisiyansk.
The espionage service of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation informs that destroyed military equipment and corpses of Ukrainian soldiers, dressed in civilian clothes, are being brought to this locality. The initiators and organizers of the challenge are the specialists from the Psychological Information and Operations Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
[...]
This situation will be used as another pretext to accuse the Russian troops of a ""bloody crime"" against peaceful Ukrainian citizens. After the staging of the ""crime"" committed by the Russian military will be prepared, journalists from the Ukrainian and Western media will be invited. , including from the United States, Latvia, Great Britain and Poland.
[...]
This scenario, which is cynical, primarily towards its own people, as towards the dead Ukrainian soldiers, repeats the atrocities of the Nazis during the Great War for the Defense of the Fatherland"", comments Mihail Mizintev.
NARRATIVE: The Ukrainian army will stage a new massacre following the model of those in Bucea or Borodianka.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The statement of the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Russia is part of a series of similar statements, disinformation and fake news thrown on the market with the aim of assigning responsibility to the Ukrainian side for the war crimes committed by the Russian forces. Nothing is mentioned about Bucea or Borodianka, but it is implied that the Russian general is considering ""staging a new massacre"" after the cases in the Kiev region. Some evidence (satellite images, drone footage) unequivocally attests that the Russian military are those who massacred the civilians in Bucea, a fact confirmed by numerous testimonies documented by the international press, organizations for the defense of human rights and investigators in the initial phases of the investigations that are still ongoing
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives of the Russian media, according to which American experts believe that the massacre in Bucea is an invention of ""Ukrainian propaganda"", and the French gendarmes will hide the traces of the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea. During April Russian propaganda distributed both false narratives in parallel, although they exclude each other: on the one hand, the West wants to hide the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea, on the other hand, the massacre in Bucea is a stage.
Colonel General Mihail Mizintev's statement deepens the second false narrative about the crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine. In reality, no corpses or destroyed equipment were brought to Lisiciansk, a town in the Donbass area.
The head of the Luhansk State Military Administration, Serghei Gaidai, reacted to this propaganda message, saying that no body was found in the city. He wrote on Facebook that ""the occupiers want to hide their own crimes with such information and blame the Armed Forces of Ukraine"". Gaidai also added that the Russian soldiers are opening fire with artillery on the town of Lisiyansk, which means that they could many civilians will be killed. Then, the Russian propaganda will again blame the ""Ukrainian propaganda"" that staged the massacre. Publication / Media:

The false narratives are used alongside the older meta-narrative of Western responsibility for the war in Ukraine.
NEWS: ""In Transnistria, this week, several terrorist acts took place, explosions rang out in a locality where there is an ammunition depot. According to the authorities of the unrecognized republic, the Ukrainian side is involved in this incident.
The expert of the ""Rossia segodnea"" media group, Alexandr Hrolenko, told Sputnik radio that the initiator of the terrorist acts was not Kiev. ""Let's start with what is important. It is not the regime in Kiev that leads. Do you remember the strange visit to Ukraine by the head Pentagon Austin and Secretary of State Blinken? Immediately after that, the shootings started in Transnistria,"" said Hrolenko.
According to the military expert, the unrecognized republic and the Russian peacekeepers who are on its territory prevent the US. ""The USA has been hindered by Transnistria and the Russian peacemakers for a long time. I do not allow Moldova to join NATO, in a way, because it is neutral for now, according to the constitution. It is possible that, uniting with Romania, it will automatically be mentioned in NATO. The peacemakers, however, are an obstacle. Against the background of the events in Ukraine, the Americans probably want to start a fire in Transnistria, to organize a ""pacification"" operation there. We know that there are now not only Romanian but also Polish and American forces on the territory of Romania. Since December , 400 American marines are staying at one of the hotels in Chisinau"", added Alexandr Hrolenko.
The purpose of the terrorist actions in Transnistria is to seize the ammunition that is on the territory of the unrecognized republic, because the weapons supplied by the West do not always correspond to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, according to the LNR. According to Hrolenko, Western countries deliver ""used metal"" to Kiev [...]
NARRATIVES: 1. The Americans organized the terrorist acts in Transnistria. 2. The USA wants to attract Moldova to NATO, but the Russian peacekeepers in the Transnistrian region prevent this. 3. The Ukrainians organized terrorist acts in Transnistria to arm themselves with ammunition from the warehouse there. 4. The West supplies Kiev with old weapons, useless in battles.
CONTEXT: The Transnistrian region presents a major danger for the security of the Republic of Moldova, for 30 years, since there was a war on the Dniester in 1992, started and supported by the Kremlin. The 14th Army of Russia, withdrawn from Eastern Europe and stationed in the eastern districts of the Republic of Moldova, was involved in the armed conflict. Until now, on the territory beyond the Dniester, munitions dating from the Soviet period are stored, guarded by Russian soldiers. With the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the military danger in this area reappeared. Transnistria and the Russian military there can be used to open a direction of fighting against Ukraine, or at least to keep the Ukrainian military on alert. Also, there is a risk that the Transnistrian forces will be used in an attack directed at Chisinau. Between April 25-27, several explosions occurred in the Transnistrian area, at the headquarters of the security ministry in the region, at the Tiraspol airport, and two radio antennas were destroyed. It was also reported about shootings near the largest ammunition depot in Cobasna. Experts qualify these incidents as provocations by the Russian special services, while Russia qualifies them as acts of terrorism. Immediately after the Tiraspol incident, a red terrorist alert code was established in the separatist region and additional checkpoints were unilaterally installed. At the same time, one can see the prudence of the Tiraspol regime in order not to escalate the situation in the region. The officials from Chisinau claim that there are two groups there, one that would like Transnistria to be involved in the war, and another that shows more reticence. And the experts say that those who administer the region have no interest in getting involved in a war that would endanger the very prosperous businesses of the economic elites from Tiraspol. On Thursday evening, the deputy prime minister for reintegration, Oleg Serebrian, and the presidential advisor for security, Dorin Recean, met with the leader of Tiraspol, Vadim Krasnoselski, and the chief negotiator from the Transnistrian side, Vitali Ignatiev, to discuss security issues .
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the narratives is to accuse Ukraine of aggression against Transnistria, supported by Moscow. At the same time, they are meant to reinforce the Kremlin's disinformation that the war in Ukraine was provoked by the USA.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The incidents in Cobasna have not been confirmed, according to the prime minister from Chisinau, Natalia Gravrilita, but also the representative of Tiraspol in the Unified Control Commission in the security area, Oleg Beleakov, who told TASS that they heard a few isolated shootings on Ukrainian territory.
NATO consolidated its presence in the member states on the eastern flank, including Romania, but it did so in response to Russia's aggressions in the region, the large-scale invasion of Ukraine being only the most recent of these; previously, Russia attacked Ukraine in 2014 and annexed Crimea, Georgia in 2008, got involved in the war against the Republic of Moldova in Transnistria, etc.
The narrative regarding the presence of the American military in the Republic of Moldova is somewhat older, being dismantled by Veridica in 2021. Similarly, the idea of ​​NATO's supposed hostility towards the Russian Federation is one of the false narratives constantly promoted by the Kremlin which tries, in this way , to justify their aggressions. The reality is that NATO is a defensive alliance and it expanded to the east following the requests of the states in the region, which, having a bad historical experience with tsarist Russia and the USSR, wanted to be protected; considering what is happening in Ukraine, the fears of the eastern members of NATO proved to be well-founded, and their option for the Alliance, savior.
The Republic of Moldova has a different situation from that of other Eastern European states that joined NATO as a result of its status of neutrality, provided by the country's constitution and still supported by the majority of the population. The unionist current is also a minority, so that there is no question of a request to join NATO or of union with Romania.
Russian ammunition and soldiers from Transnistria are there despite the will of the Republic of Moldova, which has repeatedly requested their withdrawal. It is about old ammunition and equipment, stored there for at least 30 years, which makes it, at least partially, unsafe. The United States and its allies do not need that equipment and ammunition - numerous Eastern European states, including NATO members, produce ammunition and equipment of Soviet design, and the United States has been purchasing such ammunition from them for more than 20 years . In addition, the equipment and ammunition of this type represent only a part of the arms deliveries to Ukraine, the rest being NATO compatible weapons and ammunition, much more efficient. Probably the most famous such weapons are the anti-tank systems Javelin and the oldest, anti-aircraft, Stinger; to all these are added numerous other light or even heavy weapons (American howitzers, Australian armored vehicles, possibly German tanks, etc.).
It should be noted that the attack against the MGB in Tiraspol took place on a free day, when the building was empty and no victims or significant damages were recorded. The other attacks did not target important strategic points. The two antennas in the town of Maiak on the left side of the Dniester that were shot down were not functional, says the president of the Parliamentary Commission for National Security, Defense and Public Order, Lilian Carp. During a program on Radio Chisinau, he also said that the military airport in Tiraspol is not functional at the moment either. All this supports the version of false attacks, organized to destabilize the Republic of Moldova. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""The Foreign Intelligence Service has information about the plans of Warsaw and Washington to install military-political control of Poland over its ""historical territories"" in Ukraine, said the director of this service, Serghei Nariskin.
He explained that it is an attempt to repeat the historic ""deal"" for Poland after the First World War when the collective West, represented by the Entente, recognized the right of Warsaw to occupy a part of Ukraine to defend it from the ""Bolshevik danger"" and then to include these territories in the Polish state.
[...]
The first stage of ""reunification"" will be the appearance of the Polish army in the western region of Ukraine under the pretext of ""defense against Russian aggression"". At the moment, the way to accomplish this mission is being discussed with the US presidential administration.
[...]
According to intelligence service data, the Poles are now looking for representatives of the Ukrainian elite who will agree to collaborate with Warsaw to form a ""democratic"" group alternative to the nationalists. Warsaw believes that this step will lead to the inevitable breakup of Ukraine, and Poland will remain with the territories occupied by ""pacifiers"", Nariskin said.
NARRATIVES: 1. Poland will occupy some regions of western Ukraine, contributing to the disintegration of this state. 2. (default) Ukraine is a weak state, which will fall apart.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Of all Ukraine's neighbors, Poland has been the most vocal and active in combating Russian aggression and supporting Kiev's defensive efforts. Warsaw demonstrated through actions that it is a real supporter of Ukraine: it condemned the Russian aggression, supported the Ukrainian army, facilitated the institutional approach of Kiev to the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Poland is one of the staunchest supporters of EU sanctions against Moscow. At the same time, Poland agreed to be the main route for the weapons that the West delivers to Ukraine.
More than 3 million Ukrainian refugees arrived in Poland after the outbreak of Russia's war against Ukraine, about 80 thousand were employed in the field of work. The level of trust in Poland is at its highest in Ukraine, considering the anti-Russian position of Warsaw.
The Polish state introduced sanctions against Russia after February 24 and requested the EU and NATO to provide Ukraine with heavy weapons. Warsaw has expressed its desire to have nuclear weapons placed on its territory.
Poland was the first country to be disconnected from Russian gas supplies after it refused to pay in rubles. Moreover, Poland wants the countries that pay for Russian gas in rubles to be penalized by Brussels, with the aim of thwarting the Kremlin's plan to destroy Western solidarity. The propaganda narrative, promoted by Nariskin in the Russian-speaking media space, appeared immediately after Poland was disconnected from gas supplies.
In reality, Warsaw's actions are not determined by the desire to expand territorially at the expense of Ukraine (which contradicts its status as a member of the EU and NATO), but by the fear that Poland will be Moscow's next target. According to a sociological survey, 74% of Poles believe that Russia could attack Poland in the near future.
It is at least illogical the thesis promoted by Russian propaganda, according to which Poland would take advantage of the weakening of the Ukrainian state to occupy some regions of western Ukraine - if it wanted a weak Ukraine, Warsaw would not support Kiev so much. Poland supplied Ukraine with weapons worth 1.6 billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) to help it face the Russian invasion, and in the first days of the war, Warsaw transferred financial resources to Ukraine, being signed a memorandum of interbank assistance.
The propaganda narrative, which starts from the director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, is based on a historical argument about the First World War, and not on concrete evidence from today. In fact, this false Russian forecast is a continuation of the metanarrative, systematically dismantled by Veridica during the years 2021-2022, according to which Ukraine is an artificial state that will fall apart.
The purpose of this narrative is to show the domestic public opinion that Russia's ""special military operation"" is a necessary one and that several states would participate in the division of Ukraine in the future.
In addition, the truth about the involvement of the USA in the Ukrainian crisis is distorted. Instead of specifying the fact that Washington is arming and supporting Ukraine in order to maintain the territorial integrity of this state and stop Russian aggression, the assumption, not covered by evidence, is invoked that Poland will take control of its ""historical territories"" in Ukraine with the help of the US.

According to the false narratives of the pro-Kremlin media, Putin convinced Guterres that the Nazis in Ukraine committed war crimes and that Russia's ""special military operation"" complies with UN principles.
NEWS: Russian President Vladimir Putin demonstrated to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres during the April 26 meeting that Nazism in Ukraine is a danger to humanity, say the experts interviewed by URA.RU. He showed the head of the UN who are the real initiators of the conflict in Ukraine, told him about the decision to initiate the special military operation and presented evidence indicating the crimes committed by the nationalists. Following this meeting, according to political scientists, the UN will initiate a process at the International Criminal Court.
[...]
""We had to, in order to stop the genocide on the population of Donbass, to recognize the LNR and DNR as independent states. Following the aggression of Kiev, the leadership of the republics requested military aid from Russia. I repeat that the special operation is a necessary measure to stop the suffering of the people in those territories"", declared Putin.
[...]
Putin ordered the collection of evidence about crimes committed by neo-Nazis in Ukraine. They will also be used at the sessions of the international tribunal. It is about the massacres of civilians in Donbass: ""Tocika U"" rocket attacks on the center of Donetsk and the station in Kramatorsk, the blowing up of the Drama Theater in Mariupol, where there were approximately 200 people, the use of civilians as ""human shields"", etc. In addition, the Ukrainian authorities have constantly spread falsehoods about the Russian army: the provocation in Bucea, the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol and others.
NARRATIVES: 1. Vladimir Putin convinced the UN Secretary General that the Ukrainian Nazis should be tried at the International Criminal Court. 2. Russia did not commit any war crime on the territory of Ukraine, but, on the contrary, saved Russian speakers from the genocide organized by Kiev.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In reality, the UN Secretary General did not say that he would have changed his views on the war in Ukraine. On the contrary, Guterres mentioned that Russia intervened militarily on the territory of a sovereign state, violating the UN statute. In Moscow, the head of the UN declared that Russia started a real war against Ukraine under the pretext of its ""denazification"" and ""disarmament"", rejecting the arguments about the ""special operation"". Guterres' position also reflects that of the Assembly General of the UN, who condemned Russia's aggression in Ukraine.
It does not appear from any comment or official press release that Putin managed to change the UN Secretary General's opinion about the war in Ukraine. URA.RU writes that the UN will initiate a trial at the International Criminal Court against the ""Nazis"" in Ukraine, adding at one point that this is the opinion/assumption of some Russian experts.
If the news text mentions some political scientists from Russia, who support the Kremlin's official narratives, then the headline ""Putin demonstrated to the UN Secretary General that Nazism in Ukraine represents a world danger"" does not contain a necessary continuation - ""some experts claim from Russia"". The information should normally be published in the column ""Opinion"" and not in ""News from Moscow"". Taking into account that more and more people read the headlines and less the text of the news, many Russian speakers from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other former Soviet republics remain with the idea that the UN Secretary General ""capitulated"" in front of Putin's arguments and evidence.
The idea of ​​a trial at the International Criminal Court was mentioned in the context of the discovery of war crimes committed by the Russian military in Bucea, Borodianka, Irpen and other Ukrainian localities. Moscow blames the Ukrainian ""Nazis"" that it invented with the help of propaganda narratives dismantled repeatedly by the international press.
Veridica dismantled a series of false narratives of the Kremlin, according to which the French gendarmes will hide the traces of the crimes committed by Ukraine in Bucea, while Kiev tortures the prisoners of war and refuses to respect the Geneva Convention.
Also, at the end of March, the Russian government press wrote that the UN supports the genocide directed against Russian speakers in Ukraine.
In reality, the Russian army invaded Ukraine, bombed and besieged cities, killing thousands of civilians and causing significant damage to civilian infrastructure. Kiev claims that Russia is organizing a genocide against the Ukrainian nation. In an interview given to the BBC, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia's actions against Ukraine are not a war, but a true genocide. Publication / Media:

The false narrative is picked up by the Russian press, which is involved in an effort to ensure public support for the so-called ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
NEWS: The Ministry of Defense of Russia announces that there was a chemical attack on the positions of the Russian forces in Ukraine. The attack was carried out with the help of a drone, announced on Saturday the head of the Radiological, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. He stated that the Armed Forces of Ukraine dropped ampoules from drones that, in the event of an explosion, released toxic substances.
The content of these ampoules is researched at Laboratory 27 of the Scientific Center of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, accredited by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
[...]
Kirillov communicated that on March 9, in the Kherson region, the intelligence departments of the Russian Armed Forces found three deadly armed drones, with 30-liter containers and spraying equipment. The head of the Radiological, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces claims that in January 2022 the Armed Forces of Ukraine acquired 50 such drones, which can be used for chemical and biological attacks.
[...]
""So, in an attempt to discredit the special military operation of the Russian army, the regime in Kiev, at the initiative of the American administration, could apply in the shortest possible time a scenario that will cause the death of tens of thousands of citizens of Ukraine, but also a ecological and humanitarian catastrophe,"" the general emphasized.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine attacks Russian military positions with chemical and biological weapons, and tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens will be killed.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russia does not present any concrete evidence when it accuses Ukraine of having used chemical or biological weapons. Moreover, according to the press release of the Ministry of Defense, the Russian general spoke about a possible attack and risks of using chemical and biological weapons by Ukraine in the future, while the headlines of the Russian media show that these attacks have already taken place .
Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov's statements do not prove either that Ukraine has chemical or biological weapons, nor that there have been attacks with such munitions.
Drones with sprayers, discovered by Russia in the Kherson region, about which the Russian press also wrote, do not represent chemical or biological weapons, but are used in agriculture. The southern regions of Herson, Odesa and Nicolaev are considered important agricultural areas, and the Agras T30 drones are used to monitor plantations and spray crops. Such drones are also used in Romania, and videos about their operation are published on YouTube.
Therefore, the Russian government press and the Ministry of Defense in Moscow presented an agricultural drone from the south of Ukraine as chemical and biological weapons. Moreover, this false narrative is superimposed on others, dismantled by Veridica, according to which the Russian army identified and destroyed 13 laboratories in Ukraine where the biological weapon was produced. According to these false narratives, Russia is forced to bomb Ukrainian cities ""to save humanity"".
In fact, it is the Ukrainian side that has repeatedly expressed its fear that its forces could be attacked with weapons of mass destruction. The US representative at the OSCE stated that chemical weapons were already used by Russia in Mariupol. American diplomat Michael R. Carpenter declared that Ukraine and the OSCE experts must collect evidence from Donbass that proves the use of chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol, this being a war crime.
On the day when Michael R. Carpenter stated that Russia used chemical munitions in Ukraine, Moscow massively distributed in its own media the narrative that the authorities in Kiev threaten the civilian population with chemical and biological weapons.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Center for Combating Disinformation within the National Security and Defense Council in Kyiv assessed the statements of the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Russia as false.
""These messages are a component of the informational-psychological operation of the Russian Federation, which aims to create panic among Ukrainians, but also to put pressure on the international community to reduce the level of support for Ukraine"", according to the Center for Combating disinformation.

The narrative is not based on any research and is related to the war propaganda used by Russia.
NEWS: Residents of the regions of southern Ukraine, liberated by the nationalists, have admitted that they want the respective territories to join Russia as soon as possible, the adviser to the president of Crimea for informational policy told RIA Novosti. According to him, people fear a return of the nationalists and want to know what their future status will be. The statement was made by Kriucikov after visiting the city of Berdiansk, controlled by the Russian military.
[...] ,,People demand a quick solution to the problem of the annexation of the territories from the south of Ukraine to Russia. They want union with Russia,"" said the adviser to the president of the region.
Previously, the inhabitants of the Zaporizhia region requested a temporary accession to the People's Republic of Donetsk. Starting from February 17, the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics announced the escalation of the situation by Ukraine. Civilians were evacuated.
NARRATIVE: Residents of southern Ukraine fear the return of the nationalists and request to join Russia.
CONTEXT: Starting from February 24, military actions are taking place in the south of Ukraine. Moscow met fierce resistance from the military, but also from Ukrainian civilians, who do not want to live under foreign occupation. For this reason, Russia tried to intimidate the intellectual and local political elite, simultaneously launching false narratives about the desire of the ""liberated"" Ukrainians to be attached to Russia. Veridica has already dismantled a propaganda narrative, according to which the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye requested joining the People's Republic of Donetsk.
OBJECTIVE: Convincing public opinion in Russia that the ""special operation"" is successfully taking place by presenting invented requests of the residents of Ukraine to be protected by Ukrainian nationalists and to be joined to the Russian Federation.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Neither the media nor the representative of the Russian authorities in the annexed Crimea presents any evidence when they report on the desire of the residents of southern Ukraine to be territorially annexed to Russia. On the contrary, the residents of Melitopol, Berdiansk, Kherson and other localities in the south of Ukraine protested after they were occupied by Russia, and Volodymyr Zelensky mentioned in his speeches ""the heroic deeds of the unruly Ukrainians"". The civilians came out in the way of the tanks and Russian armored vehicles, school and business directors refused to comply with the orders of the occupation regime.
The entire international community was amazed by these protests of Russian speakers from the east and south of Ukraine, who opposed the military actions of the Russian Federation. RIA Novosti writes that the representative of Crimea came to the conclusion that Ukrainians want to join Russia after visiting Berdiansk, the city where protests against Russian aggression took place for several days in a row. People chanted ""Berdiansk is Ukraine"" and ""stop the Russian aggression"".
According to sociological surveys, conducted in March 2022 in the territories controlled by Ukraine, 9 out of 10 Ukrainians in the south of the country consider Russia an enemy. Also, the Ukrainians in the south of the country believe in the victory of Ukraine in the war started by Moscow.
The statement of the adviser of the president of Crimea for informational policy, Oleg Kriucikov, in fact prepares the public opinion in Russia for an escalation of the conflict, being false justifications of a new wave of the offensive, already underway, called by the Kremlin, a ""special demilitarization operation"" and denazification of Ukraine"". They are also trying to convince public opinion in Russia that the ""special operation"" is taking place successfully and is supported by Ukrainians. Publication / Media:

That is, the exact location that, after Putin moved the first military, became the ""Kherson Hell"".
NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine and the United States tried to draw Romania into the war with Russia. 2. Romania is a colony of the West with a weak and servile political leadership.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: For years, Russia has been trying to justify its aggressions and its aggressive stance in Europe by invoking a NATO threat - the Kremlin's propaganda ignores the fact that the North Atlantic Alliance is a defensive one. During the period in which it prepared the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia asked for guarantees that this country will never be admitted to NATO, but also that the Alliance will withdraw from the states that joined it after the end of the Cold War. The Kremlin claims that there were promises that NATO would not expand to the east, but it cannot prove these ""promises"" with any document, which were denied even by top Soviet officials of that time.
Also during the period in which the war was being prepared, a series of misinformation appeared regarding the so-called NATO bases on the territory of Ukraine. After the start of the invasion and as the Russian forces proved unable to defeat a less equipped and less numerous Ukrainian army, the narratives regarding the involvement of NATO or some foreign forces were resumed and to find an explanation for the defeats suffered in the field .
In the meta-narrative regarding the involvement of foreign forces in the war on the side of Ukraine, the Russians frequently refer to ""foreign mercenaries"" - volunteers who, encouraged by the Kiev government, joined the Ukrainian forces.
The spokesman of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Major General Igor Konasenkov, said on Sunday that Kiev would have employed over 6,800 foreign mercenaries from 63 countries, since the beginning of the Russian ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
""The most mercenaries - 1,717 people - came from Poland, and approximately 1,500 from the USA, Canada and Romania, stated the spokesman of the Russian Ministry of Defense,"" said the Russian official cited by Tass.
OBJECTIVE: To mislead public opinion in Romania that Romanian soldiers would be sent to fight secretly in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: There is no evidence that any NATO country - including Romania - sent troops to Ukraine after Russia launched its large-scale invasion. On the contrary, before the start of the invasion, the NATO soldiers known as instructors in Ukraine were withdrawn urgently. Also, the North Atlantic Alliance was careful to avoid any possible incident with the Russian forces given that they do not want a NATO-Russia conflict that could have dramatic consequences.
General Ben Hodges no longer has any official capacity as he has gone into reserve, so he does not represent the United States, NATO or any other country and cannot set policies or make decisions on behalf of any government.
The Romanian Minister of Defense, Vasile Dincu, also stated that Russian officials in the military field resort to ""false information and intoxication"".
In fact, Russia is the one that has a rich experience in recruiting mercenaries, the most famous group in this regard being the ""Wagner Group"", led by Evgheni Prigojin, a close associate of Vladimir Putin.
The BBC also reported on the fact that Russia is currently looking for mercenaries from all over the world to fight in Ukraine.
Also, the National Newspaper is constantly the source of Russian disinformation, especially in the military area, as Veridica has shown in several materials it has published in the last two years.
Last but not least, the narrative that says Romania is a ""colony"" of the West, with a servile attitude especially towards the USA, is a classic one from Russia's propaganda arsenal.

""Z"" - the symbol of intimidation of the opponents of the war
observers.france24.com / Apr. 12 2022
The letter ""Z"" appeared painted on Russian armored vehicles even before the beginning of the invasion, when Russia massed its troops on the border with Ukraine. The explanation was the need to differentiate the military equipment from that of the opponents. Meanwhile, ""Z"" became common throughout Russia the symbol of support for what Vladimir Putin called a ""special operation"" on the territory of the neighboring country. Supporters of the war are posting online from images of pizzas in the shape of a ""Z"", patients lined up in a ""Z"" in the hospital yard, and even drawings of children dedicated to the ""magical"" letter. But ""Z"" ended up being used as a weapon of intimidation by Russians who oppose or do not show enthusiasm for the military aggression in Ukraine. The journalists of the Observers show from France 24 talked to Dimitri Ivanov, a student at the University of Moscow who found his door inscribed with the message ""Don't betray your country, Dima!"", framed by the letters ""Z"". For Dima, the letter ""Z"" took on the meaning of the Nazi swastika, being increasingly used to induce fear. The second message of intimidation that Dima received was a poster with his photo taken from the Internet, flanked by the sign of the new law that provides prison sentences for those who spread information about the war or dare to oppose the aggression.
Prison - the price of the fight against Russian disinformation
meduza.io / Apr. 13 2022
Among others, Sasa Stocilenko, an artist from Saint Petersburg, fell victim to the Russian law that sanctions those who question the justice of the invasion of Ukraine. The young woman risks up to ten years in prison, being accused of spreading information ""well-known as untrue"". Sasa was arrested because, showing creativity as well as courage, she attached information about the destruction to the price tags of the products in a store from Mariupol hidden from the authorities. According to the independent Russian-language news website Meduza, based in Latvia, the judge who decided to imprison the Russian woman during the trial considered that the anti-war activist poses an additional risk because she could destroy or hide evidence , has a sister in France, friends in Ukraine and a relative who emigrated from Russia.
Warlike delirium on the state television ""Rossia 1""
1tv.ru / Apr. 14 2022
The live announcement of the sinking of the ""Moskva"" cruiser on the ""Rossiya 1"" channel of the state television angered one of the guests, who - despite the denials of the Russian Ministry of Defense - blamed Ukraine for the fact that the Russian fleet went to the bottom Black Seas. In a ridiculous logic, the heated interlocutor decreed that the loss of the ship entitles Russia to go from the ""special operation"" to the outbreak of war.
Guest: The simple fact that there was an attack on our territory represents a ""casus belli"", an indisputable argument for a real war, not the stupidity of so far! Without any kind of... What is the name of what we are doing now?
Moderator: A ""special military operation"".
Guest: Enough, enough with the ""special military operation""! It ended last night, when our homeland was attacked!
Moderator: When you say ""last night"", are you referring to the flagship ""Moskva""? And when you talk about ""war"", do you think about general mobilization?
Guest: I don't want to talk about (the ship) ""Moskva"" because there is contradictory information. But, if you still brought it up, the warship ""Moskva"" is the ultimate argument for war! 100%! It is our standard-bearer! Is there nothing left to discuss?
Sinking of the ship ""Moskva"", opportunity for online forgeries
reuters.com / 14, then 15 Apr. 2022
The causes of the sinking of the ship ""Moskva"", the star of the Russian fleet in the Black Sea, which at the beginning of the war participated in the occupation of Snake Island, remain controversial. The Ukrainian army claims that it hit the cruiser with two ""Neptune"" missiles, while the Russians claim that the cruiser would have sunk while being towed in port after the explosion of the ammunition on board. Beyond the contradictory explanations, the incident - a substantial logistical and image loss for the invaders - generated the spread of several fakes on social networks. A video posted on Twitter on April 14 became viral after it was redistributed by Andrei Biletchi, the founder of the Ukrainian Azov regiment, claiming to capture the explosion of the Russian ship hit by the Ukrainians. The Reuters agency discovered that the images have nothing to do with the Russian-Ukrainian war, being filmed nine years ago, during the testing of a Norwegian missile fired at a decommissioned ship. Two other photos distributed as representing the fire caused aboard the Moskva by Ukrainian missiles are actually taken from a video from January 2019 showing an oil tanker on fire in the Kerch Strait. A fourth photo presented with the same distorted circumstances was taken in June last year, when the ""Kharg"", the largest Iranian maritime ship, sank in the Gulf of Oman following a fire.
Russian propaganda invents American ""prisoners"" in Ukraine
verificat.afp.com / Apr. 15 2022
One of the most fanciful mystifications related to the war in Ukraine found an echo among Romanian users of social networks. ""American Lieutenant-General Roger L. Cloutier captured by the Russians"" - says the description of a video posted on Facebook on April 11 and redistributed 6,500 times in just three days. The images show a handcuffed man with a digitally censored face, escorted by two agents of the Russian FSB Security Service. In the upper-left corner there is an older photo of the general, and in the lower-right the logo of the Russian state agency RIA Novosti. France Presse verified the information, which circulated intensively in several languages, concluding that it is false. NATO has confirmed that the general, who is the Commander of NATO's Allied Land Forces in Europe, was not captured by the Russians, given that he has not visited Ukraine since last July. Other indications prove that Cloutier is at the NATO Base in Izmir, Turkey, at the headquarters of the Allied Command. On April 5, after the rumor of his capture appeared, Cloutier posted on his Linkedin page a video recording of him giving a speech at an event in Izmir . The next day, he responds to a user's curiosity, assuring him that it is not in the hands of the Russians. Two other videos available on YouTube show the general at an awards ceremony for some soldiers on April 13 and at the reception of the commander of the Southeast Multinational Corps, Major General Dragos-Dumitru Iacob, on April 14. France Presse sought to find out the identity of the character in the clip, given that the news of the American general's arrest does not appear in the Russian RIA news agency's archive. The investigation shows that, most likely, this is a man detained by the FSB in March in Crimea for allegedly being a member of an illegal battalion disguised as a Ukrainian refugee, as announced on April 7 by the TASS agency and the Zvezda television of the Russian Ministry of Defense .

In reality, the French specialists arrived in Ukraine to ascertain and collect evidence of the war crimes committed by Russia.
NEWS: The first vice-president of the State Duma for international affairs, Aleksei Cepa, reacted to the arrival of the French gendarmes on the territory of Ukraine. According to him, the French law enforcement officers will help their Ukrainian counterparts to hide the traces of the provocations that were organized in the Kiev region.
""They can't do it alone, that's why they are asking for the help of their partners in the West,"" he said. Previously, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Russian military had committed a series of illegal actions in Bucea, but not all EU member states believed this, requesting evidence that Kiev does not have, according to the National News Service.
NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine killed its citizens in Bucea and blames Russia 2. French specialists were invited to Ukraine to hide the traces of the crimes committed by the Ukrainian authorities
CONTEXT: Ukraine accused the Russian army of having committed a massacre in Bucea, discovered after the withdrawal of the Russian military on March 30. The images broadcast on television and on news sites showed streets in Bucea covered with the bodies of civilians summarily executed, with their hands tied behind their backs. After the international community found out about the massacre, the French government made the decision to grant international judicial and police assistance to ascertain and collect evidence of the war crimes committed in Ukraine by Russia. A team of gendarmes and magistrates was sent to Bucea.
OBJECTIVE: Exonerating Russia, convincing public opinion in Russia that Ukraine is the one that killed civilians with the support of the West.
WHY THE FALSE NARRATIVE: The crimes in Bucea were committed during the period when this locality was under the control of the Russian occupation forces. Some evidence (satellite images, drone footage) unequivocally attests to this, also confirmed by numerous testimonies documented by the international press, organizations for the defense of human rights and investigators in the initial phases of the investigations that are still ongoing. At the same time, the alleged evidence of Russian propaganda regarding the involvement of Ukrainians in war crimes has also been shown to be false. President Volodymyr Zelenski went to Bucea and denounced from there the actions of the Russians: ""They are war crimes and will be recognized by the world as genocide"".
At first, Russia did not blame Kiev for committing the murders in Bucea, but stated that the massacre was an invention of the media. Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives, according to which the images from the Kiev region are rigged, and the news about the massacre of civilians are elements of ""Ukrainian propaganda"". He wrote about the crimes committed by the Russian military on the official Facebook page and the town hall of Bucea on March 6. So the crimes could not have been committed by Ukraine, whose armed forces were withdrawn from the locality. There was no interest on the part of Kiev to hide the traces of these atrocities.
Kiev asked the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send investigators to Bucea as soon as possible to collect evidence of war crimes. In response, the French Government decided to provide judicial and police assistance to this investigation at the international level. According to the Twitter page of the French Ambassador to Ukraine, Etienne de Poncins, the French specialists came to help their Ukrainian colleagues in the investigation of the war crimes committed around Kiev.
The statements of the first vice-president of the State Duma for international affairs, Aleksei Cepa, have, therefore, no basis. Not only France sent its specialists to Ukraine, but also the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Great Britain. Also, 42 states addressed the International Court of Justice in The Hague to investigate this case, and Ukraine expressed its openness to support any teams of foreign forensic experts and experts that will be sent to the Kyiv region.
While Ukraine requests the support of the international community and shows itself to be open to cooperating with foreign specialists, Russia either denied that civilians were killed in Bucea, or blamed the Ukrainian authorities. Both the statements of Russian politicians and the false narratives in the media show that the Kremlin is trying to discredit any collective international initiative to investigate the crimes committed in the Kiev region.

Zelenski explained that this conflict was initially planned to take place between Ukraine and Russia. At the same time, Zelensky emphasized, it is ""difficult to prepare alone"" for a war with such a powerful state and that is why ""Ukraine wanted to join NATO"". ""That's why we wanted NATO. That is why we stabilized the situation in Ukraine. That's why I needed strong leadership within my team. That's why we fought with some political groups inside our state"", declared the Ukrainian leader.
He added that the military confrontation was initiated by Ukraine ""a long time"" before the launch of Russia's special operation for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. According to Zelensky, Ukraine had to prepare in time and especially needed money and armament.
NARRATIVE: Zelenski admitted that it was Ukraine that started the conflict with Russia
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The statements of the president of Ukraine are taken out of context and specially arranged to illustrate the theses of Russia's propaganda and disinformation narratives in the context of the war that broke out on February 24. The interview published by the BBC is entitled ""This is not war, this is genocide"". Volodymyr Zelenskiy stated, in fact, that he knew in advance of Russia's intentions to start a war against Ukraine, that is why he had to prepare for the organization He said nothing about any attack on Russia or about the intention to enter into a conflict with Moscow, but instead accused the Kremlin of seeking war in recent years.
""We knew that Russia could attack us at any moment, because the war has been going on since 2014. That's why we wanted to join NATO. That is why we stabilized the situation in Ukraine. That's why I needed strong leadership within my team. That is why we fought with some political groups within our state funded by Russia. We started this war early,"" said Zelenskiy.
The words ""we started this war early"", which referred to the protection of the internal political and informational space of Ukraine, were presented in the Russian press as ""a recognition"" by President Zelensky of Kiev's bellicose intentions.
In the interview given to the BBC, Zelenski dismantles a series of false narratives by Russian officials and the government media about Ukraine, which would have sought to go to war with Russia. ""During the first two years of the presidency, I did everything I could to meet with them. To negotiate with the Russians, to end the war with them in the east of the country. It was my emotional mission, my humanitarian mission, which I wanted to complete successfully,"" Zelensky said, accusing Russia of never seeking peace, but only ways to escalate the conflict and occupy Ukraine.
In fact, Ukraine proposed to join NATO not to attack Russia, but on the contrary, to defend itself against it. NATO is a defensive alliance, and according to Art. 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, collective defense is triggered if a member is attacked, not if he attacks someone. In 2019, Ukraine included in the country's Constitution the provisions on Euro-Atlantic integration precisely because it needed a collective defense format, understanding that a war with Russia would be a difficult task for its armed forces.

The narrative, launched after the Republic of Moldova banned symbols associated with the Russian army and the invasion of Ukraine, ignores the fact that the USSR was the aggressor state at the beginning of the Second World War, and at the end it became the occupying power.
NEWS: Activist Igor Tiuleantev commented on his page on social networks the ban by the Parliament of the ribbon of St. Gheorghe. ,,53 PAS deputies voted for the banning of the St. George ribbon. This symbol is directly related to the victory of the Soviet people over fascism. Elements of this ribbon can be found on the orders of Glory, on the medals ""For the victory over Germany in the Great War for the Fatherland"". Among the Red Army were also the sons of the Moldovan soil. Practically in every family of Moldovans there are Heroes who fought for our freedom , for a clear sky overhead,"" Tuleantev wrote. According to the activist, thanks to these people, the deputies, including those from PAS, sit in the legislative body and discuss democracy, European values, pluralism of opinions. ""If it wasn't for the Victory of 1945, there would be no Moldovan parliament, no PAS, there would be no Moldova either. Victory in 1945 is a fact! The victory of 1945 does not need to be defended! The symbols of the Great Victory were, are and will be. 53 PAS deputies attacked not at Victory, not at St. Gheorghe, they spat in front of all the citizens of Moldova. To everyone without exception. They spat in our history, in our values, in our memory"", says Tiuleantev. [...] NARRATIVES: Moldovans must be grateful to the USSR for liberating them in 1945.
CONTEXT: The Chisinau Parliament voted, on Thursday, April 14, in the final reading, an amendment to the Contraventional Code by which the symbols of Russian aggression in Ukraine are prohibited - the signs ""Z"", ""V"" and the black-orange ribbon. The making, sale and public use of attributes and symbols of military aggression and war crimes will be penalized. The project was initiated and voted by PAS deputies, who declared that under these symbols people are killed in Ukraine. The use of these symbols in the demonstrations in Chisinau would be a defiance of the tragedy in Ukraine, PAS deputies consider. On the other hand, the pro-Russian parliamentarians from the bloc of socialists and communists criticized this amendment, on the grounds that it would strike at the symbols of victory from the Second World War. They blocked the Parliament tribune as a sign of protest, while the project was being presented, after which they left the meeting hall. Communist leader Vladimir Voronin downplayed this topic, declaring that Stephen the Great himself used this ribbon.
The black-orange ribbon is associated with Russian imperialism and is used especially on May 9, when Russia celebrates the victory in the Great War for the Defense of the Motherland. The Russian military uses ""Z"" and ""V"" as symbols of the ""military operation"" in Ukraine. With the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, this symbolism permeated the public space in Russia. The two-color black-orange ribbon was banned in Ukraine in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea by Russia, as a symbol associated with the separatists. Then, even Belarus and Kazakhstan gave up this symbol, on the holiday of May 9. In the Republic of Moldova, the bicolor ribbon is worn by the representatives of the pro-Russian parties and their sympathizers, the population nostalgic for the USSR, but also by people who do not know the meaning of these symbols. Former president Igor Dodon, the leader of the socialists, announced that he will break the law and wear this bicolor ribbon on May 9, urging the population to do the same.
Igor Tiulentev is a pro-Russian activist from Chisinau, member of the anti-fascist organization Russian Youth League from the Republic of Moldova, known for his anti-Romanian or anti-Ukrainian actions and statements.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the narrative is to justify the imperialist actions of the Russian Federation and to support the idea that Moldova belongs to the Russian World.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Victory in the Great War for the Defense of the Homeland was mythologized by the USSR and was taken over by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who celebrates May 9th every year with pomp and military parade. The USSR, currently also the Russian Federation, takes the greatest credit for the defeat of Nazi Germany in the Second World War, a war in which the Soviet Union had the greatest loss of human life, over 20 million victims. In this war, indeed, Romanian-Moldovans also fought, enlisted in the Red Army after the territory between the Prut and the Dniester was occupied by the USSR, initially in 1940, following the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, signed in 1939 between Hitler's Germany and The USSR led by Stalin, then reoccupied in 1944. In the USSR, the war and the Red Army were presented as an action to ""liberate the Moldovan people from the fascist Romanians"". In reality, however, this Romanian territory was occupied by armed forces to the USSR, and the population was subjected to acts of mass terror, political repression, organized starvation, deportations, especially in the first years after the war. The commission for the study and assessment of the totalitarian communist regime in the Republic of Moldova found that it was one criminal and repressive, abusive and inhumane, lacking legitimacy, committed acts of genocide and crimes against humanity. The crimes were done with the help of the army.
Soviet Moldova was, therefore, the result of an aggression by the USSR, and the Republic of Moldova proclaimed its independence after its collapse. The Russian Federation perpetuated the attitude of the USSR towards Moldova, showing disrespect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Russian army participated in the war in Transnistria, alongside the separatists, and remained illegally on the territory of Moldova, despite numerous requests to withdraw. The Russian forces practically guarantee, through their presence, the security of the separatist republic, which Moscow also supports financially, and at the same time threaten the security of the Republic of Moldova. Moscow also claims that Moldova is in its sphere of influence, although it is an independent state.
The ribbon of St. George is not prohibited on the medals and orders that were previously awarded, and the war veterans who hold such distinctions will be able to continue wearing them, without being fined, explained the president of the Parliamentary Legal Commission, Olesea Stamate.

In reality, Ukraine has ruled out ceding any territory, but it cannot launch reconstruction as long as its cities are bombed.
NEWS: It seems that the leadership in Kiev has forgotten about Kharkiv, consoling itself with the idea that Russia will take it. The Ukrainian authorities have allocated one billion hryvnias for the restoration of the affected regions. We do not see the Kharkiv region in this list, despite the fact that it was affected more than Sumi and especially Zhitomir.
The answer to the question ""why?"" is quite simple - Kharkiv is not among the government's priorities, as is South-Eastern Ukraine. The Kiev regime is beginning to understand that it cannot keep these regions in its component and sees no point to spend money on them.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine does not rebuild Kharkiv, knowing that it will join Russia.
CONTEXT: The news is based on a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to financially support the reconstruction by the Regional Military Administrations of infrastructure objects in the regions of Kiev, Chernigov, Sumi and Zhitomir, destroyed by the Russian army. The Telegram channel ""Z news of the rebels from Novorossia"" has over 300 thousand subscribers.
OBJECTIVE: Discourage the Ukrainian population's resistance to Russian aggression.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Telegram channel interprets the Kiev government's announcement biasedly, saying that the authorities have, in fact, given up some territories. Some explanations of Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Smigal, who dismantles this false narrative, are omitted. According to Smigal, Kiev is working on renovating the infrastructure in four Ukrainian regions liberated by the Armed Forces. The Ukrainian regions that are not completely liberated (Kharkov, Kherson, Donetk, Lungask and others) or where military actions are taking place have not been put on the list because the works cannot be carried out there. In fact, it is not even logical to renovate the civilian objectives that in a few days can be bombed again. Denis Smigal declared that only the first tranche of the financial aid intended for reconstruction was allocated, and the works in other regions will be launched immediately after the respective territories are liberated.
According to the information of the Armed Forces and the online maps of the combat actions, military confrontations continue in several localities in the Kharkiv region, and a number of localities are being bombed by the Russian army.
The statement according to which Ukraine would have been willing to cede certain territories is false. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly declared for both the Ukrainian and international media that Ukraine will fight for every square meter of territory and for every person.
For these reasons, the purpose of this propaganda narrative is to discourage Ukrainian resistance to Russia's attempts to occupy the Kharkiv region and the south-eastern areas of the country. It is also intended to create a false impression among Russian-speaking readers that Russia's victory in this war seems to be ""inevitable"".

The false narrative is promoted by Adrian Severin, a former politician who was imprisoned for corruption.
NEWS: ""What is happening now is the transition from a nation-state union to an empire. States like Romania or Hungary are the periphery of this empire, and other countries represent the hard, valuable and central imperial core"".
The former politician Adrian Severin is of the opinion that this core of the Union would pursue its own interests, ignoring the needs, objectives and requirements of the other states and removing part of their national sovereignty. In this case, the last elections in Hungary and Serbia, in which politicians opposed to the European trend won, would be frowned upon from Brussels.
""The EU has announced that it will penalize Hungary by forcing the Government from Budapest to follow a path that the people do not want. They can no longer call themselves leaders of the European Union, this is called imperialism. It is an attack on national security. If the majority of Hungarians chose this option, their interest must be followed, integrated and respected, not penalized"". NARRATIVES: 1. The EU is turning into an empire. 2. Romania is an EU colony that is exploited by powerful states that lead the Union 3. The EU persecutes Hungarian citizens, because it penalizes the Orban Government.
BACKGROUND: Last week, the Brussels executive started the procedure to suspend EU funds for Hungary. The illiberal government of Viktor Orban is accused of violating the rule of law, the President of the EC, Ursula von der Leyen, announced on Tuesday in Strasbourg, in the European Parliament.
The decision is in accordance with the Regulation on budgetary conditionality of the EC which entered into force on January 1, 2021. Until now, the European Commission has not applied it.
On March 11, 2021, Poland and Hungary contested the regulation at the EU Court of Justice. The Court ruled on this matter on February 16, 2022 and rejected both appeals. Also, the Court of Luxembourg concluded that the European regulation is in accordance with EU law and its competences regarding the rule of law.
Both Hungary and Poland, led by populist governments, but also with Eurosceptic attitudes and in some places corrupt, have been trying for several years to circumvent the commitments made by these countries by virtue of common democratic values ​​of the EU member states. They promote policies that have nothing in common with the democratic values ​​and principles promoted by the EU.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The claim that Romania is an EU colony was in recent years one of the main theses promoted by the Kremlin's propaganda machine led by Sputnik.
Veridica consistently dismantled this theme of Moscow's propaganda in Romania, which tries to induce the idea that, after joining the EU, Romanians live worse and we would have been much better off alone. A parallel is also drawn with the era of Ceausescu, obsessed with ideas such as ""non-interference in internal affairs"", but at the head of a totalitarian regime in which the standard of living and satisfaction of the population had collapsed.
Romania is currently a member of the EU with equal rights, and not a marginal country, as Russian propaganda tries to portray. Romania's problems are related to insufficient justice reform, a process that has been stagnant for several years, a fact constantly pointed out by Brussels.
Despite these problems, the EU treated Romania as an equal state in the distribution of European funds for post-pandemic reconstruction, helped and included Romania in the list of countries that benefited from vaccines, etc.
In total, during the 15 years of EU membership, Romania's GDP increased from 174.6 billion US dollars in 2007 to 248.7 billion dollars, according to World Bank data. This is without taking into account the pre-accession funds that Romania benefited from.
Also, the vast majority of foreign investments in Romania are from EU countries.
As far as Hungary is concerned, the Orban government has been violating EU principles and values ​​for years, but when it comes to European funds, it is a constant subscriber by virtue of the fact that it deserves European money even if it governs by autocratic methods.
The quasi-monopolization of the press, which practically diminishes freedom of expression and eliminates pluralism of opinion from the public space, is just one example related to the deviations from EU values. The approach to Russia and the invitation to Russian investments in Hungary (see the Paks nuclear power plant) is also an aspect that goes against EU policies, especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 from Ukraine.
In the same way, Poland has a series of slippages from the framework assumed before the EU. This after in October, the Polish Constitutional Court contested the primacy of European law over national law. Also, the anti-abortion laws adopted by the Morawiecki Government are considered by the EU to be persecution of women and violation of their rights.
These, but also other aspects, have transformed Poland and Hungary into states that are only beneficiaries of the EU, but not states that respect the rules and commitments assumed upon joining the EU.
What the EU is doing in the case of these slippages for years by the two states mentioned above is to sanction their behavior.
In no case do the punitive measures concern the citizens of the two countries; on the contrary, they are intended to defend their fundamental rights and freedoms. The fact that Orban was recently re-elected in the parliamentary elections in Hungary does not prevent Brussels from applying sanctions to this state with serious democratic problems for several years.

A Chinese teacher's pro-Russian disinformation
polygraph.info / Apr. 5 2022
The wave of international indignation after the publication of the images of the civilians killed in Bucea did not convince a political science professor from Fudan University in Shanghai. And not because Yi Shen would have considered the images to be forged. Asked by a student on the local Twitter platform about the impact of the atrocities on Russia's public image, the political science professor with 1.7 million followers on the Weibo platform said that the civilian population can be considered a legitimate target for the Russian military. He argued that, since the Ukrainian authorities have distributed weapons to civilians, they have become combatants and can be treated as such, following the model of the civilians imprisoned by the United States at Guantanamo. The Poligraph portal dismantles the claim with legal arguments, emphasizing that the Ukrainians enrolled in the Territorial Defense Forces are under the protection conferred by the Geneva Convention, as are, moreover, all those who, spontaneously, arm themselves and act openly to oppose an invading force. According to the International Red Cross, when there are doubts whether a person is a civilian or a combatant, the respective person must be treated as a civilian.
Putin's paradox: losses at the front, popularity at home
rferl.org / Apr. 7 2022
Despite Russia's military campaign, described by some analysts as ""disastrous"", the war in Ukraine seems to be costing Vladimir Putin domestically. After six months marked by human and logistical losses, growing international opprobrium and economic constraints , 81% of Russians declared at the end of March their support for the aggressive action of the Kremlin. The results of the survey carried out by the independent Levada Institute, with a good reputation in the field, seem paradoxical. The British specialists consulted by Radio Europa Libera tend to believe that, beyond the effects of state propaganda and the deprivation of citizens from sources of correct information, sociological research reveals an increasingly pronounced feeling of fear among the population, probably induced by the drastic restrictions imposed by Moscow on communications about the war. Reporters of the Russian-language television network Current time they interviewed residents of several Russian cities, asking them if they had heard of the Bucea massacre. Many echoed the Kremlin's propaganda and answered that the images of the atrocities in the Ukrainian city are fake. However, there were also Russians who declared themselves shocked, describing the crimes as ""horrible"". However, most of the respondents were reserved, avoiding to openly express their opinion.
Deceptive artificial intelligence
france24.com / Apr. 11 2022
Ranked fourth on Sunday in the first round of the presidential elections in France, the far-right candidate Eric Zemmour lived in the last weeks, together with his supporters, the illusion that he will qualify for the electoral final on April 24. And this is because of the French politician's preference for the application called QOTMII, to the detriment of traditional polls. QOTMII detects online activity through an ""artificial intelligence"" system that makes millions of calculations by scanning electronic media, including social networks. The producers of the show ""True or Lie"" on the France 24 channel found that Zemmour used the data assembled by QOTMII , who placed him in second place after Emmanuel Macron in the voters' preferences and presented them on the eve of the elections to his supporters as a favorable survey in terms of voting intentions. Although in other situations the application had relatively accurate estimates, this time it failed miserably. Zemmour obtained a little over 7% of the votes at the polls, that is, three times less than the 21.5% that the technology based on ""artificial intelligence"" credits him with.
CONSPIRACY OF THE WEEK: war crimes and the tactic of denying the evidence
news.sky.com / Apr. 7 2022
The shock caused worldwide by the images of local residents killed on the streets of the Ukrainian city of Bucea has not dissipated. Defenseless civilians, barbarically executed by the army of a state that claims that the purpose of the military aggression, hypocritically called ""special operation"", is to make Ukraine a better country. A false goal, unwaveringly promoted by Vladimir Putin's regime. For Dmitri Peskov, the spokesman of the Kremlin, the horrors in Bucea are only a new so-called ""proof"" of the omnipresent disinformation, set up by the world conspiracy whose victim is Russia.
Interview with Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's spokesman - Sky News:
D.P.: ""We live in a time of fakes! We encounter fakes and lies every day!
I: Then I ask you the following. The Russian ambassador to the UN said that there is no credible information regarding the existence of civilian victims. Regarding the situation in Bucea, according to the statement of April 3 by the Russian Minister of Defense, ""not a single local suffered from any violence while the city was controlled by the Russian army"". Do you really expect the world to do you believe this statement?
A: We maintain this statement. We maintain it and insist that the whole story from Bucea is a slanderous stage well put together.""
The attempts of the British journalist Mark Austin from the Sky News channel to obtain reasonable explanations for the evidence that has become notorious of the massacre in Ukraine were met by the casual insolence of Peskov. For the Kremlin spokesman, the satellite images that prove that the murders in Bucea took place when the town was under the control of the Russians would not be credible because Maxar - the space technology company providing the images - would also have the Pentagon among its clients . The image that captures the tragedy of the woman with a bicycle killed on the street by a tank shot is rejected by Peskov with the objection that the armored vehicle was not Russian. After dismantling the argument with the detail of the insignia of the Russian army on the tank, the spokeswoman of the Kremlin insinuates that the fatal shot would have come from another direction. Faced with the testimonies of murders, summary executions and rapes collected by Amnesty International, other humanitarian organizations and independent journalists, Vladimir Putin's spokesman dodges, cynically invoking the alleged crimes committed by Ukrainians among separatists in Donbas, which the Westerners would have ignored. Dmitri Peskov's position is representative of the disinformation practiced by the Moscow authorities in the Bucea case: a mixture of mystifications, fanciful interpretations and ridiculous accusations. On April 3, the Russian Ministry of Defense distributed on its Telegram channel - which has 200,000 followers - a video of Yablonska street in the city near Kiev covered with corpses, stating that the images filmed from a vehicle are a hoax. The so-called demonstration, also taken over on the Twitter account of the Russian embassy in Canada, tries to convince the viewers that one of the alleged victims is moving, even seems to stand up after the passing of the car, as seen in the rear-view mirror. The induced conclusion, taken over by the media obedient to the Kremlin, would be that there are no corpses, but only actors playing the role of victims. However, the statement is contradicted with evidence by some of the most credible publications and international news agencies. First of all, the testimonies of the journalists - supported by the comparative analysis of the image of the corpse contested as unreal with the photos taken by the press correspondents who arrived at the scene on April 2 - exclude the theory invented by the Russian propagandists. Secondly, the frame-by-frame analysis of the clip in the original version, superior in quality to the one distributed online, coincides with the observations of several users: the corpse is motionless, the perception of movement is induced by a drop of water or dirt on the windshield of the car from which films, and the rearview mirror distorts the reflected image. Another pseudo-argument invoked by Russian officials in support of the Bucea massacre theory is the March 31 recording in which Mayor Anatoli Fedoriuc happily announces the departure of the Russians from the city, without making any reference to the atrocities attributed to them. A subreddit reasoning, since, in an interview given on March 28 to the Italian agency Adnkronos, Mayor Fedoriuc denounces - I quote - ""the rapes, robberies and corpses on the streets"" which the Russian soldiers are guilty of, who do not let them let locals bury their dead relatives. Russia's insistence on blaming its enemy for its own crimes against civilians experienced a new episode last week, with the Ukrainians taking control of Borodianka near Kiev. All the blocks of flats that flanking the main street were destroyed by shells, which confirms the testimonies of local residents according to which a column of retreating Russian armored vehicles systematically fired at civilian buildings encountered on the way. Witnesses say that the Russian military, including snipers, would have been deterred under the threat of weapons any attempt by the residents to search for the survivors buried under the ruins.The number of victims of the Borodianka massacre - for which the Kremlin also says it is not responsible - would, according to the Ukrainian authorities, be significantly higher than the one in the neighboring city of Bucea.
Interview with Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's spokesman - Sky News:
I: Isn't Mr. (Vladimir) Putin worried that he might end up being tried for war crimes?
D.P.: No, it is not!
The most recent attempt to hide the reality by the Russian invaders came on April 8, after the rocket attack on the Kramatorsk train station in eastern Ukraine, which at that time was full of thousands of civilians being evacuated. The balance sheet, still provisional, indicates over 50 dead, including children. Russia denied any responsibility for the attack and accused Kiev of using human shields, while pro-Russian separatists described the incident as a Ukrainian ""provocation"". The Russian side says that, unlike the Ukrainian army, it would not it still had the Tochka-U missile model used in the attack, however, several images and clips recently posted on social networks prove that this type of Soviet-era missile was also used by the Russians in the current war in Ukraine.

It's an invention; there is no request in this sense.
NEWS: ""The residents of the city of Zaporizhia are asking the head of the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), Denis Pusilin, to join their territory to the DNR. A video report about the residents' demands was published by the special correspondent Kurlaeva on the ""Kur_LIFE"" Telegram channel.
""The residents of the city of Zaporizhia are asking Denis Pusilin to take them into the DNR component, there is more peace there"", commented the author of this video. In addition, the townspeople thank the DNR army in the person of the head of the republic, ""for the peaceful sky"" . Kurlaeva reminded that in the liberated territories, the inhabitants will obtain the citizenship of the republic, and then, if they wish - also of Russia.
[...] People's militias from the Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics continue to receive complaints about the bombing of the inhabitants of Donbass from Ukrainian Grad and Uragan launchers.""
NARRATIVE: The inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye request to join the People's Republic of Donetsk.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The video clip, quoted by the Russian press and made by a journalist from Donbass, does not include any reference, any demand or statement about the desire of the inhabitants of the city of Zaporozhye to be attached to the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk. It is a report published on Telegram, with over 215 thousand views, which, in fact, does not even include footage from the city of Zaporozhye, but from the village of Rozivka, located 170 kilometers from the regional center of Zaporozhye. It is a locality near the Mariupol district, controlled by the Russian army. Therefore, the title and content of this propaganda narrative are false: the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic was not in the city of Zaporozhye, but in a village far from it, and no one there requested to join the separatist republic.
In fact, Denis Pusilin's visit to the city of Zaporozhye is impossible at the moment. While the village of Rozivka is occupied by the Russian army, the city of Zaporozhye is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the report of the Ukrainian army, in the Zaporozhye region, the localities of Zatisia, Malinivka, Vesele, Zeleni Gai, Cervone and others were liberated by the Russian invaders.
The purpose of this propaganda narrative is to prepare the public opinion in Russia for a future escalation of the conflict in Donbass, as false justifications for a new wave of the offensive called by the Kremlin ""special operation for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine"" have been built.

NEWS: ""After the beginning of the Russian special operation in Ukraine, in the Republic of Moldova the trust in NATO and in the Western structures suddenly decreased. Almost 30 years after the fall of the USSR, international organizations surrounded the country like a spider, telling Moldovans how the West can help them live better and how it will protect them from ""Russian aggression"". Today, despite these words , citizens with a sober mind begin to understand that NATO is not a reliable partner, but a threat to the security of the state.
[...]
People see that NATO has abandoned Ukraine, and they understand that it will also abandon Moldova, Romania, and all those who will come into conflict with Russia, and our country will become a battlefield for foreign interests."" NARRATIVE: NATO is not a reliable partner and will not ensure the security of its own members in the event of an attack from Russia.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is considered the most vulnerable country in the region in terms of a potential armed conflict. With a small territory and an underfunded army, it also faces a separatist conflict in the eastern region, which is led by a pro-Moscow regime supported by the Kremlin and where Russian military troops and ammunition are stationed.
The approach of the Republic of Moldova to the EU has been viewed critically by Moscow and by pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau, who, especially lately, have been sending alarmist messages about the possibility of the Republic of Moldova joining NATO, or the use of its territory by NATO .
Narratives about the preparation of the Republic of Moldova for a war against Russia, its involvement in military conflicts, the use of infrastructure by NATO to support Ukraine in the war with Russia have intensified in the last period of time, the aim being to fuel the citizens' fears and negative attitude against NATO.
OBJECTIVE: To present NATO as a weak alliance, which is unable to defend its own members, suggesting, at the same time, that Russia is (much more) powerful from a military point of view.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, only one survey was conducted in which citizens were asked about the option of joining NATO. Almost 22% declared that they would vote for joining NATO, in case of a referendum. Their number is decreasing compared to the summer of last year, when a third would have opted for. The decrease in the intention to vote for joining NATO occurred gradually, starting with August 2021, and is more related to the reduction of trust in the government of the pro-Europeans from the Action and Solidarity Party, who came to power after the elections in July 2021. A proof in this sense, trust in NATO has also increased previously with the elections won by center-right parties/politicians.
NATO did not ""leave Ukraine alone"", because it had no obligation towards it, the country not being a member of the Alliance. Before launching the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia asked for guarantees that this country would not be received in NATO, precisely because it knows that, once accepted into the Alliance, Ukraine would be protected. The very fact that Russia decided to attack Ukraine, but not smaller states like the Baltic states, is a clear demonstration of the fact that NATO represents the security guarantee of its members , under the conditions that Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that an attack against a member state is an attack against all.
NATO has supplemented the troops and defense capacity of the states on its eastern flank, especially in Romania, Poland and the Baltic States. Leaders of the organization, including the vice president of the USA, Kamala Harris, in Bucharest, gave assurances that NATO will defend each of its members.
Finally, although NATO refused Ukraine's request to ensure a no-fly zone, because it wants to avoid a conflict with the Russian Federation, the Alliance expressed its solidarity with Kiev and numerous member states delivered it ammunition and equipment in worth billions of euros.

The false narrative was launched by the Russian Ministry of Defense and distributed by the Russian press.
NEWS: ""On April 1, the regime in Kiev informed the Foreign Ministry of Great Britain that it does not intend to respect the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, informs the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. Also, according to the data of the Russian defense department, the Ukrainian authorities and the Western states want to convince the International Committee of the Red Cross to stop seeking any contact with the Russian prisoners.
""These manipulations around the Russian military are proof of the fact that the authorities of several states in the West are becoming complicit in the inhumane crimes of the Ukrainian neo-Nazis,"" declared the head of the National Defense Administration Center of the Russian Federation, colonel general Mihail Mizintev.
[...] Previously, the UN requested that the cases of torture applied to Russian soldiers on the territory of Ukraine be investigated"". NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine refused to comply with the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. 2. The UN asked Ukraine to stop torturing Russian soldiers.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: After the start of the war against Ukraine on February 24 a.c. Russia met enormous resistance in all the regions it wanted to occupy. At the same time, the Kremlin faced the problem of the motivation of the Russian military. After it became clear that the war in Ukraine cannot be concluded victoriously for Russia in a few days, the Russian media and the spokespersons of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow resumed the false narratives about the crimes and bad behavior of the Ukrainian military, this time Kiev being accused of not complying with the provisions of the Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of Russian prisoners, the problem being analyzed at the UN level as well.
The Geneva Conventions represent a series of treaties formulated in Geneva, Switzerland, which establish the standards of international law regarding humanitarian issues. These treaties mainly refer to the treatment of non-combatants and prisoners of war. The conventions assume a humane treatment of all non-combatants and prisoners of war. There is ample evidence that the Russian army has repeatedly violated the Geneva Conventions, by bombing numerous civilian targets in Ukraine, including medical centers, schools and kindergartens, by summarily executing hundreds of Ukrainians, including civilians, rapes, tortures and robberies.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to sow hatred and anger in the environment of Russian society towards the Ukrainian military, called ""neo-antis"", with the aim of obtaining greater popular support for the war launched by the Kremlin in Ukraine. It is also desired minimizing Western support for Ukraine, but also diverting attention from the war crimes committed by the Russian army.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In reality, Ukraine has not notified Great Britain or any other state of its refusal to comply with the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. The representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called the statements of the spokesperson of the Russian Army as false narratives.
In fact, if we analyze the Geneva Convention signed by Ukraine, we notice that there is no legal possibility to renounce compliance with its provisions if the state is in conflict.
According to article 142 of the Convention regarding prisoners, if a state wishes to denounce it, the act enters into force only one year after a notification to this effect and it is forbidden for the denunciation to take effect in time of war or before all the prisoners have be repatriated. Therefore, Kiev cannot notify someone that it refuses to the Geneva Convention, nor can it somehow influence the activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross. It should also be noted that if a state has denounced the Geneva Convention and is at war with a signatory state, the latter is obliged to respect it.
It is also not true that the UN asked Ukraine not to torture Russian citizens. In reality, the UN asked Russia and Ukraine to verify if some complaints and video clips indicating bad treatment of soldiers in both countries are true.
As a reaction, the Parliament of Ukraine, which is the body competent to monitor the observance of the Convention, tasked the Plenipotentiary of the Supreme Rada for human rights, Lyudmila Denisova, to visit the places where the Russian prisoners of war are kept. After a series of visits and discussions with the Russian military, she declared for the Ukrainian press that she found a fair treatment towards them. She refuted the information from the Russian media, that someone is torturing the prisoners. ""There are some films made by Russians, which then become fake news,"" said Denisova.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Oleg Nikolenko, wrote on his Facebook page that the statements of Russian officials are not true, with the aim of discrediting the relations between Ukraine and international humanitarian structures, which save the victims of Russian aggression and he tries to bring home the deportees or the prisoners of war. ""Despite the hundreds of fake news, our state remains faithful to its international obligations under international law,"" wrote Nikolenko.
NUTS OF TRUTH: Ukraine has published numerous times on its official pages video clips and photos of prisoners of war from Russia, in which it has emphasized the fact that all their rights are respected according to the Geneva Convention. However, the publication of the recordings was categorized as a violation of the Geneva Conventions by Human Rights Watch, an organization that documented and denounced numerous war crimes committed by the Russian army, including in Bucea. The BBC, on the other hand, confirmed as real a recording showing the killing of a captured Russian soldier. Publication / Media:

""We must not trust Kiev's information [...]"". According to him, any statement about atrocities must not be taken seriously without an official investigation. It is paradoxical that Kiev is not interested in carrying out an investigation. ""It is more convenient for Ukraine to get some immediate results and continue the propaganda actions,"" said Jatras.
[...] After the representatives of the SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] arrived in the city and the journalists from the West started to promote this fake news about the massacre of civilians by the Russian military.
NARRATIVE: American experts believe that the Bucea massacre is an invention of ""Ukrainian propaganda""
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: A series of publications from Russia (Novostivl.ru, Izvestia, Vm.ru, 9111.ru, 36on.ru s.a.) quote James Jatras and generalize by stating that the position expressed by him towards the massacre in Bucea , which coincides with that of the Kremlin, is that of the US experts.
The entire international community was shocked by the atrocities in Bucea, documented by dozens of journalists from Western countries.
The town in the Kiev region was liberated by the Ukrainian army, which discovered a large number of corpses dressed in civilian clothes, many showing signs of summary executions and torture. President Volodymyr Zelenski traveled to Bucea and denounced the actions of the Russians from there: ""They are war crimes and will be recognized by the world as genocide"". Zelenski added: ""You are here and you can see what happened. We know that thousands of people were killed and tortured, limbs broken, women were raped and children killed"".
Russia denies having committed war crimes in Bucea, emphasizing that the images from the Kiev region are fake, and the news about the massacre of civilians are elements of ""Ukrainian propaganda"". To convince the public opinion in Russia that Moscow has not committed war crimes In Ukraine, Russian propaganda resorts to quoting convenient experts from abroad, whose opinions are presented as the opinion of all scientists or as the official position of a state.
This time, James Jatras was cited, who was invited to Ren TV to create the illusion that the West supports the Russian version of the presentation of events in Ukraine. This political scientist is permanently invited to Russian government stations such as RT or Sputnik, openly promoting the Kremlin's narratives. James Jatras is used by Russian propaganda to illustrate their own narratives, as in the case of other Western ""experts"" who have served the Kremlin in recent years.
Analyzing the satellite images, The New York Times came to the conclusion that many civilians were killed 3 weeks before the liberation of the city of Bucea from the Ukrainians. American journalists showed how the bodies appeared in Bucea in mid-March and were there until the arrival of the Ukrainian army. The Russian press ignores such analyzes by major publications and only quotes a convenient American expert, presenting him as an indisputable analytical voice.
It is also not true that Ukraine would not want an investigation. Veridica has already written about the initiative of the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who asked the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send their investigators to Bucea as soon as possible to collect evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russian troops.
About the crimes committed by the Russian soldiers, he wrote on the official Facebook page and the town hall of the city of Bucea on March 6: ""the enemy continues to attack houses, cars, kill civilians, even children, rob shops"".
The US President, Joe Biden, requested the opening of a trial for war crimes against his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, following the assassinations in Bucea. ""You may remember that I was criticized in the past for calling Putin a war criminal. Well, the truth is that you saw what happened in Bucea. He is a war criminal. But we need to gather more information,"" Biden said. Publication / Media:

The ""checkerboard"" of Kremlin propaganda
indiatoday.in / 21 Mar. 2022
In the shadow of the armed invasion, Moscow continues its information war. The India Today television channel sketched the portraits of the main characters responsible for the internal and external propaganda that Vladimir Putin relies on. Maria Zaharova, head of communication and press relations of the Russian Foreign Ministry, is famous for her harshness and provocative messages. She is the one who, before the war, derided the warning of the West regarding the imminent attack on Ukraine, commenting ironically that she would schedule her vacation according to the predicted invasions from the West. She also accused Western journalists of ""informational terrorism"". The list continues with Margarita Simonian, the editor-in-chief of Russia Today, one of the most influential women in Russia. When the television she runs announces the recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian separatist regions by Moscow, Simonian remarked with amusement the lack of champagne in the studio, later declaring herself ""overwhelmed"" by the joy of the invasion of Ukraine. Maria Butina - third on the list - is a deputy in the State Duma, after being convicted in the United States in 2018 as a Russian spy agent. She was released and expelled after serving half of an 18-month prison sentence. The ""checkers"" of Kremlin propagandists is completed by Valentina Matvienko, senator and president of the Council of the Russian Federation. Being on the list of undesirable persons from America, passing through the European Union and all the way to Australia, Matvienko declared in the Upper Chamber of the Parliament that, ""invading Ukraine is the only solution to end this war between brothers"".
Ukrainian testimony about the forced resettlement in Russia
washingtonpost.com / March 30 2022
With the same inversion with which it denies the deliberate killing of Ukrainian civilians from the first day of the war, Russia continues to reject the information that it would forcibly transfer thousands of Ukrainian citizens from the occupied areas to its own territory. The Washington Post publishes the disturbing testimony of a woman from Mariupol who was escorted with her whole family to a so-called ""sorting camp"" located in the border area. Under the protection of anonymity, the woman told American journalists that she was photographed, her fingerprints were taken and her phone was confiscated from which all her data, including contacts, were downloaded.She was then subjected to repeated interrogations, including by the Russian FSB security service, asking her to gives her opinion on Ukraine, Russia and Vladimir Putin. Later, she was transferred to the Russian port of Tagonrog. She managed to escape by telling the Russians that she had a friend in a nearby town who could host her and her whole family. The claims to Ukrainian officials regarding the forced relocation of civilians to cities far from Russia are reinforced by the American Embassy in Kiev, which accused the Russian army of kidnapping thousands of children from the eastern Donbas region.
The battlefield organ harvesting conspiracy
reuters.com / Apr. 1 2022
The Canadian cyber security agency warned in a message on Twitter about new disinformation campaigns by the Kremlin, added to the already known propaganda narratives intended to support the invasion of Ukraine. It is about launching and amplifying the theory according to which the Ukrainians take organs both from soldiers fallen in battle and from civilian victims, women or children. In fact, it is about the resuscitation of an older theory, promoted intensively but dismantled in 2015, after the annexation of Crimea by Russia in Crimea. Another disinformation identified by the Canadian intelligence service concerns the labeling of opponents of the war and critics in Russia as ""supporters of neo-Nazism and genocide"" practiced by Kiev. The already compromised thesis of an attack by the army is not missing from the inventory of Moscow's disinformation made by the Canadians the Russian only of military targets, as well as the equally false one of the extremely small number of civilian victims.
Russia, from war propaganda to war crimes
ohchr.org / Apr. 3 2022, corriere.it / Apr. 4 2022, news.un.org / 3 Apr. 2022, reuters.com / Apr. 3 2022, bbc.com / 5 Apr. 2022
More than a month after the assurances given by Russia that its soldiers are not a threat to the Ukrainian population, the official number of civilians killed by the invaders has reached 1,500. Only in the city of Bucea in the Kiev region, the Russian army left behind more than 400 corpses, some showing signs of torture or mutilation. The atrocities in Bucea made the columnist from Corriere della sera headline that ""the Russians crossed the red line between war and barbarism"". The terrifying images, the findings of journalists and humanitarian organizations that arrived at the scene, but above all the shocking testimonies of the survivors about group or individual executions, rapes and robberies will increase the file of war crimes prepared by the International Criminal Court. In a recorded message, the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky described the deliberate crimes as ""genocide"" and made an emotional appeal to the mothers of the soldiers Russians, whom he described as ""butchers"". A call that, most likely, will remain without a recipient, given the censorship imposed on the Russian media by the Kremlin. Following an already established pattern, Moscow officials vehemently denied any involvement of the Russian military in the massacre. However, Moscow's position is contradicted by the satellite images, which show that some corpses were lying on the streets for several weeks, that is, from the time when the city of Bucea was under the control of the Russian army.
The Nazis of the ""Wagner Group"" on a mission of ""denazification""
pravda.com.ua / April 4 2022-04-05, reuters.com / 28 Mar. 2022, france24.com / 30 Mar. 2022
Ironically, while declaring that the fight for the ""denazification of Ukraine"", Russia is using a private paramilitary company with proven links to far-right and racist groups. It is the dreaded ""Wagner Group"", whose offspring in eastern Ukraine, recently announced by the British Ministry of Defence, was confirmed by the photo of a combatant taken on Monday in front of the former headquarters of the OSCE in Donetsk. According to the British intelligence services quoted by the Reuters agency, among the approximately 1,000 mercenaries deployed in the east of Ukraine there are prominent leaders of the organization. France 24 observes that the involvement of the ""Wagner Group"" coincides with the announcement of the change of strategy of the Russian army, which will apparently focus on the control of the separatist region of Donbas. Moreover, the ""Wagner Group"" - nicknamed the ""Private Army of Putin"" - actively supported the Donbas separatists in the conflict with Kiev in 2014. In recent years, the organization has participated as an armed force to protect the interests of Russia in more than ten countries on four continents. The established methods of fulfilling the group's missions cause concern in the context of the Bucea massacre: executions, rapes and torture.

NEWS: ""Journalist Iosefina Pascal declared during the show ""Iosefina Scams"" from GOLD FM that: ""President Zelenski's speech in the Romanian Parliament reached a very serious point. What does the right of the Romanian minority in Ukraine have to do with the current conflict and with help from Romania?"" [...] Iosefina Pascal is of the opinion that the leader from Kiev would condition normality, being completely wrong to respect a minority in the country where you are president only after your help is guaranteed. These rights of the Romanian minority in Ukraine should have been respected all the time, both in peacetime and in wartime, not just after the end of the conflict with Russia. This is because the abuses against the Romanians in Cernauti, and not only, in recent years are well known.
""Zelenski conditions the respect of the rights of the minorities in Ukraine on the help from Romania"" - emphasizes the GOLD FM journalist. ""This is not correct. Currently, tens of thousands of refugee children from Ukraine study in Romanian schools in Ukrainian, but Romanian is not allowed in schools in Chernivtsi and the rest of Ukraine. Romanian and Moldovan children cannot learn in their mother tongue, and this has been happening for years"" [...] In the same speech in the Romanian Parliament, Volodymyr Zelenski recalled by the former president Nicolae Ceausescu and the Revolution of 1989 [...] The GOLD FM journalist finds this attribution to be unnecessary and unjustified: ""Ceausescu and Romania have never invaded anyone. Moreover, Nicolae Ceausescu opposed the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Zelenski forgot that back then, Ukraine was a member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and that his country participated in the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the communists"". NARRATIVES: 1. Zelenski blackmails Romania for help in the war with Russia 2. Ceausescu was an international pacifist, not a local dictator.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenski, gave a speech in the Romanian Parliament on Monday in which he thanked Bucharest for the help given to Ukrainian refugees and invited Romania to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine.
He emphasized that Ukraine needs everyone's help at this moment, both in terms of military and political support in Brussels in its approach to joining the structures of the European Union.
On the other hand, the Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca declared after Zelenski's speech that Romania will welcome the Ukrainian refugees with open arms and will help them with everything they need and asked for Ukraine to take care of the Romanian community as well from Ukraine.
He reminded that about 30,000 Ukrainian children have already been placed in educational institutions in their mother tongue in several schools and high schools in Romania.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing negative attitudes related to Ukraine among Romanians against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Josefina Pascal was heavily promoted, before the war, by the Kremlin mouthpiece, Sputnik, and since Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine, she has been one of the voices spreading false anti- Ukrainians in the Romanian public space. This time, Josefina Pascal tries to change the notes of Zelenski's speech. She says that Zelenski ""conditions"" the respect of the rights of the Romanian community in Ukraine on helping Romania in the war. A careful reading of the Ukrainian president's speech does not in any way denote the thesis supported by Pascal.
Instead, attributing some connotations of virtual blackmail to Ukraine on the issue of the rights of Romanians in Ukraine is done in the key of the Russian propaganda metanarrative which says that Ukraine should not be supported by Romania under any aspect, because it does not respect the rights of Romanians in Ukraine, mainly access to education in native language. This thesis was supported even before the war and is still being promoted by Russian propaganda in Romania.
Moreover, Zelenski promised that immediately after the war, Romania and Ukraine will discuss a new legal framework that will mutually protect the Romanian and Ukrainian minorities in a comprehensive manner.
""As soon as the situation allows, I want to launch a dialogue with you on a new comprehensive agreement that will guarantee the absolute protection and comprehensive development of our national minorities - the Ukrainian community in Romania and the Romanian community in Ukraine.""
In an analysis for presshub.ro, the specialist in Russian disinformation and propaganda, Nicolae Tibrigan, recalled a revisionist speech by Putin addressed to Romania, Hungary and Poland, which he told to join Russia to reclaim territories from Ukraine :
""Then, both before and after the Great Patriotic War [Second World War - ed.], Stalin incorporated into the Soviet Union and transferred to Ukraine some territories that previously belonged to Poland, Romania and Hungary. In the process, he offered Poland some of what was traditionally German land as compensation, and in 1954, Khrushchev, for some reason, took Crimea from Russia and also gave it to Ukraine. . In fact, this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed,"" Putin said.
Russian propaganda is currently following these directives, when it comes to fueling nationalist theses in Romania.
Regarding the parallel with Nicolae Ceausescu, Zelenski wanted to make an analogy between Ceausescu's dictatorship, which the Romanians could no longer bear, and Russia's dictatorial manifestation over Ukraine, in the sense that Moscow wants to decide for Kiev, what course should this country follow. Obviously, one without membership to the European Union or NATO, under the pretext that this puts Moscow's security and existence at risk.
The attempt to deride Zelenski's metaphor is once again an attempt to reinterpret the message of the leader from Kiev and at the same time to glorify the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, another metanarrative of Russian propaganda in Romania, especially for the older and nostalgic category after those times.

In reality, the USA has not sent and will not send soldiers to the territory of Ukraine in the context of the war with Russia.
NEWS: The US is preparing to send former soldiers of the national army from Afghanistan to Ukraine, according to RIA Novosti, citing its own sources. Washington will send about 400 soldiers to the area of ​​military actions. Military personnel will receive American weaponry.
[...] The soldiers of the National Army from Afghanistan were evacuated to the USA in the summer of 2021 after the Taliban came to power (""Taliban"" - terrorist movement banned on the territory of Russia). At the moment several thousand people, who they used to be at the American military bases in Afghanistan, they live in refugee centers.
According to the sources, these former soldiers paid by the USA may be drawn into the war in Ukraine, being threatened that they could be deported from the USA. They also promised the military a fee of thousands of dollars. [...] Currently, Russia is carrying out a special operation to de-Nazify and demilitarize Ukraine.
NARRATIVE: The US sends to Ukraine Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban in the West.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On February 24, Russia launched a war against Ukraine under the pretext of its ""denazification"" and ""disarmament"". Before invading Ukraine, Moscow had asked for guarantees that the country would never join NATO (although it is its sovereign right) and that NATO would withdraw from the member states of Eastern Europe. At the same time, Russia has been running a disinformation campaign for years in which it accuses NATO of alleged aggressive intentions towards it, despite the fact that the Alliance is a defensive one. Practically, after the Yugoslav wars (which ended following the efforts made by NATO and the West), the only country that threatened, through war, the security of Europe is the Russian Federation. Beyond the military aggressions, Russia also unleashed a real informational war, to which were added attempts to destabilize Western societies (by influencing the electoral process).
At the same time, Russia issued imperial claims in the ex-Soviet space, where it supported separatist entities and made efforts to block the democratization and rapprochement of the former Soviet republics with the West. The first invasion of Ukraine was launched, moreover, in 2014, after the Yanukovych regime was removed - which, also under pressure from Moscow, had given up at the last moment to sign the Association Agreement with the EU - and the country announced its intention to resume the European course.
In February, Russia attacked Ukraine with overwhelming forces, which managed to resist, causing massive losses to the invading forces, so that Russia was forced to turn to Wagner mercenaries, Chechen fighters and mercenaries recruited from Syria. However, the Ukrainian army is outnumbered on several levels - it doesn't have as many people, as much equipment, and it is outnumbered especially in terms of aviation and artillery. Kiev has launched numerous calls for help, especially to obtain a no-fly zone to eliminate the threat to Russian aviation, but the West cannot take the risk of a conflict with Russia, so it has limited itself to providing support by pressuring Moscow with sanctions and delivering to Ukraine certain types of light weapons, ammunition, humanitarian aid and funds. At the same time, some Western countries allowed their citizens to volunteer in Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to demonstrate to the readers that in Ukraine there is a conflict between Russia and the West, led by the USA, which is mobilizing foreign human resources to fight against the Russophones.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the US has not sent and does not intend to send troops to Ukraine. The Afghan National Army was largely disbanded in 2021 after the withdrawal of NATO troops. The soldiers from Afghanistan have reached the neighboring states or have gone over to the side of the Taliban. Some soldiers were evacuated to the USA. Washington reported at the beginning of this year that all the evacuated Afghans were distributed among different American states, and some of them were integrated into the American society within some government programs.
American President Joe Biden has repeatedly declared that he will not send the army to Ukraine, because this decision could generate a Third World War.
There is no official statement regarding the recruitment of Afghans or the sending to Ukraine of soldiers with combat experience from Afghanistan. The subject is presented as a real one and exists only in the informational space in Russia to convince the internal public opinion that Moscow is a ""savior"" of the Russian speakers in Ukraine from the ""future aggressors from Afghanistan"".
Last year, in Great Britain, the idea of ​​establishing Afghan units, modeled after the Gurkha units, made up of Nepalese fighters, was floated, but it got nowhere. In March this year, American diplomat Philip S. Kosnett published an article on the CEPA (Center for European Policy Analysis) website in which he proposes the establishment of an Afghan legion alongside the United States army. The diplomat explained that there are tens of thousands of Afghan refugees in the US, many with war experience, who need a job. In addition, there is also a shortage of troops within NATO, due to the member states' difficulties in attracting volunteers for the armed forces, and Russia's aggressions show that troops are needed to protect NATO's borders. Therefore, it is only about ideas, not officially assumed, proposed as solutions on the one hand to help the Afghan refugees, on the other hand to allow the Alliance to better face the threats of Russia.
In addition, the Kremlin is looking for justifications in front of its own citizens, but also the international community, why it calls on troops and mercenaries from Syria. The narrative tries to exonerate Russia by demonstrating similar ""sins"" in the case of the USA. Publication / Media:

In the Republic of Moldova, they vandalize Soviet monuments and fight with the locals, writes the Russian publication mk.ru, citing social networks, but without proving the accusations. In the Republic of Moldova, several such disinformations were dismantled by the press.
NEWS: ""The behavior of Ukrainian refugees causes more and more dissatisfaction among the citizens of the states that host them. Social networks are filled with videos of drunken Ukrainians in stores, demanding special behavior in relation to them. (...) Moldovan citizens do not understand why foreigners behave not as guests, but as masters - they come in expensive cars, vandalize monuments and tell the locals which language to speak.
[...]
For example, Moldovans do not like the refusal of their guests to pay in public transport. Although in Moldova, it is quite expensive.
[...]
In addition, the newcomers have declared war on the Soviet monuments, which they covertly paint in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. This is what happened in the case of the T-34 tank in Ciniseuti village, painted at night by unknown vandals.
Moldovans complain that their guests ask for free food in restaurants and they complain about the quality of services, although they are offered the best. Recordings are published in which Ukrainians are admonished and reminded how to behave.
,You received free housing, food and water, diapers for children and so on. Who are you? The waitress serves you, and you start shouting that she addressed herself in Russian', a local woman shows her displeasure."" NARRATIVE: Ukrainian refugees in the Republic of Moldova behave aggressively, uncivilized and provocative.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: From the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, on February 24, until April 2, almost 4.2 million Ukrainians went abroad because of the war, according to the data of the UN Refugee Agency. Most of them - over 2.4 million - moved to Poland, and almost 400,000 entered through the Republic of Moldova, a state with approximately 3 million inhabitants. Most of them only transited the Republic of Moldova on their way to the EU, but over 90,000 are still in this country. At one time, the Republic of Moldova hosted the largest number of Ukrainian refugees compared to the country's population. Both the state, which created centers for refugees, where it offered free shelter, food and medical assistance, and citizens who hosted and continue to host refugee families got involved. The majority are women, children (half of the refugees are minors) and the elderly, because Ukraine does not allow men between 18 and 60 to leave the country.
The press published a large number of reports with Moldovan citizens who host refugees, work as volunteers at placement centers, collect products and money for them, but also with refugees who express their gratitude. However, since the beginning of the refugee crisis, a campaign about alleged abuses committed by Ukrainians has been launched on social networks, which were widely picked up and published by the Russian press. Such narratives about refugees have also appeared in other countries, including Romania, which suggests that it could be a concerted campaign.
OBJECTIVE: To present the Ukrainians as an aggressive and ungrateful people, in order to reduce the sympathy of public opinion towards them after the Russian invasion. To justify the Russian military intervention in Ukraine
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The narrative is based on unproven accusations in some cases and, each time, on generalizations, referring to the statements of some people without verifying the facts.
In Ciniseuti, Rezina district, indeed the pedestal on which a Soviet tank is erected was painted in the colors of Ukraine, but there is no evidence that it was done by Ukrainian refugees, who should have stopped on the road, bought paint and to lose a piece of the day. The same thing happened with the Soviet tank in Leuseni, close to the border with Romania, and some pro-Russian politicians accused the Ukrainians of ""vandalizing"" the Soviet monument, as later, the leader of the National Unity Party (unionist) , Anatol Salaru, to announce that his team painted the pedestal.
And the accusations about Ukrainians who refuse to pay the bill, or behave aggressively when spoken to in Russian, are generalized and based on unfounded statements. Veridica dismantled such misinformation and so did the press from the Republic of Moldova.
News also appeared in the Republic of Moldova that Ukrainian refugees travel for free on public transport in Chisinau, even if no official decision was made in this regard. But the mention in the article published by mk.ru that public transport in the Republic of Moldova is expensive, is at least far from the truth. A trip by trolleybus in Chisinau costs 10 cents, and by bus - 15.
NUTS OF TRUTH: There were, most likely, abuses and cases of aggressive behavior on the part of some Ukrainian refugees, but these are exceptions, not the general rule.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Chisinau authorities urged citizens not to distribute false messages about Ukrainian refugees, and President Maia Sandu mentioned in a speech to citizens that ""it is unacceptable and irresponsible that incidents involving refugees are speculated by people in office public, dignitaries and elected for political purposes"".

According to him, denazification will reduce the number of nationalists in the country.
Basirov explained how many people in Ukraine really support aggression against the Russian Federation.
In Ukraine, convinced nationalists are somewhere around 5%. The rest simply wait and pray in silence for the Russians to come and release them, end this history of destroying their consciousness and memory,"" Basirov emphasized.
NARRATIVES: 1. 95% of Ukrainians are waiting to be freed from Russia. 2. Russia was/is being attacked by Ukraine. 3. Russia was forced to launch a ""special operation"" whose objective is the ""denazification"" of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The stubborn resistance of the Ukrainian army, the numerous cases documented by the mass media in which the civilian population, instead of meeting them with enthusiasm, protested against the Russian occupation forces, the mobilization of civilians to support the war effort show that , in fact, most Ukrainians do not want the Russians to be in their country and perceive the invasion as it is - an aggression and an unprovoked attack. There is not 95% of the population that prays and waits to be freed from Russia, but, on the contrary, the invasion caused a consolidation of the Ukrainian civic identity. According to a sociological study carried out by ""Rating"", 9 out of 10 Ukrainians believe in Ukraine's victory over Russia. Veridica showed in an analysis that for 98% of Ukrainians Russia is the enemy of their state, as well as Belarus (84%) People who didn't think Russia would attack changed their minds
War propaganda reverses the roles of victim and aggressor. It is Russia that has invaded Ukraine since 2014, annexing Crimea and militarily supporting the formation of the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. In 2022, Moscow also recognized the independence of the two separatist republics, and shortly after that launched a second invasion, this time on a large scale, of Ukraine. The Russian army is the one that bombards the cities of Ukraine, has killed thousands of civilians and caused massive destruction, including numerous infrastructure targets, schools, medical centers, residential buildings, and yet it is shown as a victim of ""aggression"" Ukrainian.
The narrative about nationalists and Nazis in Ukraine was used by Russian propaganda as a pretext to invade Ukraine on February 24. From June 2021, the Russian press began to distribute more and more false narratives about Ukrainian Nazism. The pro-Kremlin press wrote that Ukraine has become a Nazi state with the direct support of the West and represents a danger to Russia's security. In reality, as Veridica also showed, the extreme right formations in Ukraine have insignificant support from the population and they did not even manage to obtain a mandate in the parliament in the last legislative elections.

The sniper ""Wali"" - the target missed by Russian propaganda
france24.com / March 17 2022
Presented by the Kremlin's war propaganda as a masterful success of the Russian army, the information about the liquidation of the Canadian sniper nicknamed Wali - the one who, at the age of 40, chose to join the cause of the defense of Ukraine - turned out to be a lamentable fake. Several posts initially distributed in China and subsequently becoming viral on social networks around the world between March 12 and 16 suggested the murder of Olivier Lavigne-Ortiz - Wali's real name -, just 20 minutes after the veteran of several campaigns against the Islamic State would have joined the defenders of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. There was even a clip with the alleged Chechen fighter who would have hacked the most feared sniper in the world, although other rumors attributed his killing to a sniper from the Red Army. The denials published by Wali on his Facebook account, where he also posted a suggestive photo, did not convince either the supporters or the enemies. Things became clear on March 22, when the producers of the show The Observers from the France 24 channel managed to have a video-telephone conversation with the elite shooter. Wali told the journalists that he was not in Mariupol at all, that he found out about his alleged liquidation on the Internet and that, in his opinion, the disinformation - otherwise easily dismantled - would have been aimed at discouraging foreign fighters who want to help Ukraine before the Russian invasion.
Embarrassing pranks for British ministers
bbc.com / 23 Mar. 2022, france24.com / 26 Mar. 2022
Two Russian pranksters associated with the Kremlin's propaganda, known online as Vovan and Lexus, published the video recording of the conversation they allegedly had on March 17 with the British Secretary of Defense. Ben Wallace was visiting Poland when he was called by someone who claimed to be the Prime Minister of Ukraine. From the recording, which lasts less than two minutes, it appears that the British minister would have been asked to support the Ukrainian nuclear program under the conditions of the Russian threat, and he would have answered confusedly and hesitantly, which gave water to the mill of Russian propaganda. Shortly before the publication of the clip, which British officials say was digitally altered, Wallace admitted that he had been called by an impostor. The London government, which asked YouTube to remove the clip from the platform, accuses Russian propaganda of targeting more and more British officials with fake calls in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. According to the BBC, among them are the Minister of the Interior Priti Patel and the Minister of Culture, Nadine Dorries.
Disinformation of an anonymous traveler in Kiev
reuters.com / 24 Mar. 2022
The author of a video posted on social networks tried to convince his followers that the inhabitants of the capital of Ukraine lead their daily lives peacefully, sheltered from the horrors of the Russian invasion. And he succeeded to a good extent, considering that the 15-minute film - a so-called ""travel diary"" on the route Great Britain - Poland - Ukraine - gathered thousands of views and redistributions. In the comments attached to the images filmed in Kiev at the beginning of the month, the anonymous traveler claims that he walked around the whole city and that, despite the news from the area, he did not hear any bombings, did not see any destruction, and the local people follow their daily routine. The conclusion would be that Kiev is rather similar with a filming set of a Hollywood production than with a real theater of war. Reuters journalists, who broadcast reports on the attacks on the outskirts of the capital, demonstrate based on the route followed by the author of the clip deduced from the corroboration of the filmed images with the geolocation data that it went around in a circle on an area of ​​2 square kilometers around the central station, avoiding the areas confirmed by multiple sources as being affected by the attacks of the Russian army.
Romania's false territorial claims in Ukraine
umbrella-strategica.ro / March 25 2022
Russia is spreading rumors about alleged ""separatist plans"" of Ukraine's allies in an attempt to cause discord and confusion among Ukrainians. The publication umbrelastrategica.ro quotes the Ukrinform news agency, according to which pro-Kremlin pseudo-analysts list Romania among the states that would threaten territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Center for Combating Disinformation within the Security Council in Kyiv claims that such theories are promoted by forces that claim to be in opposition to the Vladimir Putin regime. For Russian propaganda, the eventual introduction of peacekeeping missions in Ukraine would lead to the ""partition of its territory"" and the return to the borders of 1939. Theories regarding the division of Ukraine seem to be influenced by the speech of President Vladimir Putin, who repeatedly stated that modern Ukraine was created by the Soviets, who gave him territories as a gift previously belonging to Russia, Poland, Romania and Hungary. But Putin's thesis ignores the existence of the Ukrainian People's Republic from 1917-1920, which administered a large part of the territory of the current Ukraine - without Bukovina and southern Bessarabia - before it was invaded and annexed by the Soviet Union.
The ""Nazi"" cross of the Jewish president Zelenski
politifact.com / March 25 2022
The propagandists of the Kremlin create arguments in support of Vladimir Putin's theory regarding the ""denazification"" of Ukraine. And they do it ignoring the fact that the president of Ukraine is Jewish. Opponents of Volodymyr Zelensky shared posts on Facebook and Twitter accusing the Ukrainian leader of carrying including in the video address to the Congress of the United States a military T-shirt with the Nazi insignia of the ""Iron Cross"" from the Second World War. The American site politifact.com dismantled the mystification, explaining that the insignia on Zelensky's T-shirts represents the official emblem of the Ukrainian Army, which has the country's coat of arms in the center. The emblem was officially adopted in 2009 and can be found both on the army's website and on the accounts intended for public communication.
Fictitious case of German ""Russophobia"".
dw.com / 25 Mar. 2022
The accusations of Russophobia brought to the West by Kremlin propaganda do not represent a new disinformation tactic. However, they wear forms adapted to the war with Ukraine. A video in which a woman laments in Russian the comatose hospitalization of a 16-year-old Russian who she says was savagely beaten by a group of Ukrainians in the train station of the city of Euskirchen near Cologne - without the police having taken any action against him the aggressors - sparked emotion and revolt. Later, the woman returns with a message in which she says that the young man died as a result of his injuries. Deutsche Welle verified the authenticity of the claims and learned from the police in Bonn, which has jurisdiction in Euskirchen, that there was no such incident either in the city or in the surroundings. The police also announced that they are investigating the woman in the video under the suspicion of spreading false information inciting hatred. German journalists discovered that the video was taken and promoted on the Telegram account of Alinna Lipp, a German of Russian origin who works for the Moscow-controlled press in the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic. Meanwhile, the author of the initial post retracted her statements and apologized in a new clip, claiming that she herself was the victim of malicious misinformation.

The narrative falls into the category of Russian propaganda that tries to shift the responsibility of the war from the aggressor to the victim (Ukraine) and its supporters (NATO). In Romania, the narrative is promoted by Ion Cristoiu, present in the public space and with other pro-Russian disinformation.
NEWS: ""The strong words spoken about Vladimir Putin by Joe Biden on the occasion of his recent tour in Europe made a big deal in the world: war criminal, butcher, dictator. As the US president said, maddened by the text on the prompter, that Putin must be removed from power, some commentators, but also some politicians (Emanuel Macron, for example) reprimanded the leader of the White House for what they called breaking the rules of diplomatic behavior at such a level. As the main argument against such language, avoided by American presidents even during the Cold War (in the speech announcing the blockade, in the Missile Crisis of 1962, John Kennedy did not make Nikita Khrushchev a communist dictator), the truth that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet with Vladimir Putin [...]
What happened to Joe Biden, otherwise a president in his place, exempted from the antics of Donald Trump? The main decision of the NATO Summit of March 24, 2022 gives us the answer:
The alliance will not get involved in the war in Ukraine. Neither by creating a no-fly zone, nor by sending peacekeeping troops [...]
The involvement of the world media in this mechanism through the daily insistence on the horrors committed by the Russian Army and the tragedy of the refugees, has increased the risk that the public opinion will form, under the power of emotion, the conviction that NATO must intervene to put an end to barbarism and to give it down from power the monster Vladimir Putin [...]
The main supporter of military non-intervention, especially of keeping the War with the Russian Federation within the limits of economic sanctions, was Joe Biden. Not because he is on Vladimir Putin's side, but for a reason related to his involvement in the global campaign for America to remain the only world superpower. Therefore, regarding the War in Ukraine, NATO's decision not to intervene remains crucial. This means that Ukraine is left to fend for itself. Why did Joe Biden decide this? Because in the American strategy of putting Russia on its feet, Russia must be defeated by Ukraine. In order to remove Russia from the game, so that America remains face to face only with China, the War must be prolonged. This means the increase of antipathy towards Russia and the possibility of plots in Moscow to disembark Putin. One is to fight NATO and the other is Ukraine, presented in the media, through a huge manipulation, as lacking the Army, resisting the aggressor through the War of the Whole People. To cover this reality, Joe Biden spared no harsh words to Vladimir Putin. Words, no matter how strong they are, are not effective against Russian cruise missiles. Why did Joe Biden launch into unusual attacks at such a level? To hide NATO's decision to go to war with the Russian Federation until the last Ukrainian."" NARRATIVES: 1. The United States/NATO maintains and amplifies the war in Ukraine so that Russia is defeated and Vladimir Putin removed from power, which also explains Joe Biden's statements. 2. USA/NATO fights Russia by proxy and sacrifices Ukrainians to achieve its goals. 3. Ukraine was abandoned alone in front of Russia. 4. Putin is not an aggressor, but a victim of American plans.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHO: Although Russia invaded Ukraine with clearly superior forces, it failed to achieve a quick victory or, at least, to capture any important city, and suffered significant losses. Russia is in a period of regrouping and rethinking its tactical plans and seems to have abandoned the discourse on ""denazification"", an objective that was one of the pretexts invoked to attack Ukraine. What Russia is doing now on the ground is nothing but destroy civilian infrastructure through remote missile bombing and hold civilians captive in besieged cities. Although humanitarian corridors have been opened to them, convoys have often been deemed unsafe due to non-compliance with ceasefire agreements. The city Mariupol is an example of this, heavily bombarded by the Russian army. Civilian casualties are estimated at thousands, and the brutality of the siege generated a humanitarian crisis in the city that was largely destroyed by the Russians; their actions there could even be considered war crimes.
Although Moscow now claims that it wants to withdraw some of its forces, most analysts believe that Russia is trying to buy time to regroup and reorganize its military objectives. Moscow needs a tangible success following this military adventure in Ukraine to justify itself internally, where the invasion is presented as a ""special denazification operation""
The narrative that attempts to exonerate Russia is promoted by Ion Cristoiu, a former collaborator of the Romanian Security Service, who has also promoted pro-Russian disinformation since the war began.
OBJECTIVE: To shift the responsibility of the war from Russia to the West. To induce the idea that the West is only using Ukraine in its geopolitical game against Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Russia is the one that invaded Ukraine, on several fronts, without being provoked in any way. The Russian army is the one besieging Ukrainian cities, the Russian army is bombing civilian targets in Ukraine, and the war could stop when the Russian forces stop their operations and withdraw to their territory. Russia invaded Ukraine for the second time (after the initial attack in 2014 when it captured and annexed Crimea and initiated and militarily supported the formation of separatist republics in the Donbass) placing ultimate conditions on both Kiev - disarmament, regime change, surrender of some territories , giving up the right to decide what kind of foreign policy he wants to pursue and the kind of future he wants - as well as NATO, which he also asked to withdraw from Eastern Europe.
However, despite the fact that Ukraine is the target of a massive assault and the unequivocal evidence and testimonies showing the extent of the destruction caused by the Russians, the Kremlin's propaganda assigns Kiev the responsibility for the excesses committed by the Russian army - the Ukrainians would be the ones who destroyed Mariupol, the civilians they would be used as human shields, civilian objectives, including the maternity hospital in Mariupol, would actually be military, etc.
Cristoiu's narrative regarding the fact that the USA has no interest in stopping the war in Ukraine, which was otherwise started by the Russians, is also present these days in the Russian media.
""The data on American military spending show that a peaceful scenario for the resolution of the conflict in Ukraine is unfavorable for Washington,"" said retired lieutenant general Iuri Netkachev for Nezavisimaia Gazeta.
""The United States intends to lead and support Kiev's military operations against Russia in both 2022 and 2023"". The expert does not exclude the covert involvement of the Pentagon and NATO forces in military operations against the Russian Federation.
""As long as Russia does not show activity in the directions of Kiev and Chernihiv, there can be several scenarios for such an intervention. First of all, there is a real threat of imitation and falsification by Kiev or Washington of the facts regarding the use of chemical weapons by the Russian army. Joseph Biden openly said that if such weapons were used, the United States would directly support Ukraine. Secondly, it seems that the Pentagon, with the help of technical means, will try to develop scenarios for the local closure of the airspace over Ukraine. It is possible that, for this, six EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft from the VAQ-134 squadron of the US Navy were deployed from the United States to Germany,"" said the expert quoted by Nezavisimaia Gazeta.
On the same wavelength as Ion Cristoiu is the Russian columnist of Sputnik, Alexandr Khrolenko, who writes on March 28 for Sputnik that ""the operational situation in Ukraine resembles the end of a chess game, when there are still many pieces and pawns on board, but the outcome of the game is obviously a foregone conclusion. At the request of the American masters, the Kiev regime is simply playing for time and cynically shedding Slavic blood - before the inevitable capitulation under Moscow's conditions (it simply cannot be otherwise, Russia sacrificed too much in the Ukrainian war by proxy with the USA and NATO)"".
Regarding Joe Biden's speech in Warsaw, the American president's tougher calls to Putin are not new. Biden also called Putin a criminal in March 2021 for Russia's meddling in the 2020 US presidential election.
NATO and the USA have always said that they will not intervene directly in the war in Ukraine, because this would lead to the outbreak of the Third World War. As a defensive Alliance, NATO is not meant to attack but to protect its members - and those in Eastern Europe have a rich historical experience of Russian aggression. Ukraine also wanted to join NATO precisely to be protected from an attack like the one it is being subjected to now. However, Russian propaganda tries to invent hostile NATO movements because the invented ""threat"" of the Alliance was one of the pretexts used to invade Ukraine.
On March 24, Russian government newspaper Rosskaia Gazeta quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as warning NATO countries against deploying peacekeeping forces in Ukraine, saying it could lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.
The deployment would be ""a reckless and extremely dangerous decision"", said Peskov. ""A special operation is underway and any possible contact between our troops and NATO troops can lead to quite understandable consequences, which will be difficult to correct."" , he pointed out.
Also, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov declared that Russia could be on the verge of a direct confrontation with the NATO countries that send weapons to Ukraine.
Therefore, Russia is in the position of a country that threatens NATO, even though the Alliance has clearly said that it will supply defensive weapons to Ukraine attacked by Russia, but without directly intervening.
This is NATO's strategy regarding this war, and the Alliance does not let Ukraine fight alone, but delivers weapons. On the other hand, the EU grants money and material aid to the civilian population in Ukraine, but also hosts Ukrainian refugees.
In fact, the US and NATO said in unison that the approach could change only if Russia starts using chemical weapons in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

The UN General Assembly previously adopted a resolution - ignored by Russia - demanding an end to the conflict.
NEWS: ""The UN Security Council once again showed the world its uselessness in matters that require an urgent solution to save people. The humanitarian resolution of the Russian Federation (co-authors - Belarus, North Korea and Syria) demanding a ceasefire and the evacuation of civilians from Ukraine was blocked. The document did not receive the necessary 9 out of 15 votes.
Russia and China supported the adoption of the resolution. France, Great Britain, USA, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Norway, Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, United Arab Emirates abstained. Although none of these countries voted ""against"", it is amazing that none of them want to stop the terrible crimes of the Ukrainian Nazis against civilians.
Kiev will continue to use the civilian population as human shields and, contrary to international law, to concentrate heavy weapons near hospitals and kindergartens [...]
In Kharkiv, civilians were shot, who, being desperate, exhausted by hunger and lack of water, wanted to leave the basement of one of the houses. ""For this initiative, they were shot by nationalist fanatics right in the yard of their house,"" said colonel-general, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, Mihail Mizintev.
NARRATIVE: The UN supports the genocide directed against Russian speakers in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The UN Security Council rejected the resolution initiated by Russia under the conditions that it did not make any reference to Moscow's role in triggering the humanitarian crisis - it appeared after the Russian army invaded Ukraine and bombed and besieged cities , killing thousands of civilians and causing significant damage to civilian infrastructure. Russia's cease-fire proposal also has a dose of cynicism, given that the Russian army is the one that should cease fire and withdraw to end the war.
In addition, 140 UN member states voted for the resolution ""Humanitarian Consequences of Aggression against Ukraine"", which accuses Moscow of military aggression. The MFA of Ukraine thanked the international community for adopting this resolution, which requested Russia to cease fire, not attacks civilians and non-military infrastructure.
According to the propaganda of the Russian Federation, the UN opposes the evacuation of civilians from Ukraine, who do not want to be killed by the Ukrainian ""Nazis"". In reality, the resolution of the UN General Assembly demands exactly this - to create humanitarian corridors for civilians. The signatories of the resolution proposed to the Security Council, Russia, Belarus, China, Syria and Eritrea, voted against the resolution of the General Assembly. Therefore, even Russia opposed the creation of humanitarian corridors in the context of a resolution that calls it the author of an act of aggression.
The information in the Russian media about the attacks against civilians by the Ukrainian forces is not true either. Veridica recently dismantled a Russian propaganda narrative, according to which Mariupol was destroyed by Ukrainian (nationalist) forces in the city. The narrative is meant to divert attention from the fact that the Russian army massively bombed the city, without taking into account the fact that it kills civilians or the destruction caused. International observers and journalists have documented numerous Russian attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine, including in Kharkiv or Mariupol. According to the Ukrainian authorities, over 4,500 houses and 400 educational institutions were destroyed by Russia in Ukraine. Publication / Media:

Serghei Savostianov's approach, which is not clear to whom it is addressed, was taken up by a large number of media institutions from Russia, but also from the targeted countries. The official Russian media, such as TASS or RIA Novosti, ignored them.
NEWS: The Baltic countries, but also Poland, Moldova and Kazakhstan must be ""demilitarized"" and ""denazified"" by Russia, considers the deputy of the Moscow Duma [not to be confused with the State Duma of Russia. The Moscow Duma is the local council of the Russian capital, on behalf of the Communist Party, Serghei Savostianov, who drafted such a document
""The demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine will ensure the stable security of the peoples of Ukraine, Russia, and the whole of Europe. For a total process of ensuring the security of the IFR, in addition to Ukraine, it would be logical to include the Baltic States, Poland, Moldova and Kazakhstan in the demilitarized zone"", he mentioned.
NARRATIVE: Neighboring countries represent a danger for the Russian Federation, which must intervene militarily to ensure its security.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: On February 24, Vladimir Putin gave the order to invade Ukraine as part of a so-called ""special military operation"" aimed at ""demilitarizing"" and ""denazifying"" this state. Both are pretexts that do not - they have nothing to do with reality - Ukraine, led by a Jewish president, is not Nazi (the far-right groups did not even get the necessary votes for a single mandate in the Ukrainian parliament), and from a military point of view it is clearly inferior in terms of effectiveness and armaments for Russia, which, on top of that, is a nuclear power; moreover, it is Russia that has attacked Ukraine since 2014.
However, the Kremlin claims as its exclusive sphere of influence the territory of the former USSR and part of the former socialist camp and promotes this idea both at the political level and in cinematography and showbiz, an example being the song sung by the Russian performer Oleg Gazmanov at a recently organized patriotic concert in Moscow, where he glorifies the USSR and considers the former Soviet states, including the Republic of Moldova and the Baltic States, as his homeland. In addition, Russia has issued the claim that NATO should not have any connection with the ex-communist states, although they are the ones that requested/requested to join the Alliance precisely because they fear Russia, which historically has been a power aggressive, which attacked them and occupied their territories over time.
OBJECTIVE: To maintain in the collective mind the idea of ​​a strong Russian state, capable of ""shaping"" its neighbors according to its own needs. To present the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine as a successful one, which will continue in other states as well. To demonstrate the support of the Russian society towards the war in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: None of the states mentioned by the elected local Muscovite represent a danger to Russia and do not intend to attack this country. The Baltic countries and Poland are members of NATO, a defensive alliance.
The Republic of Moldova is a small, neutral country with a miserable military budget, and Kazakhstan demonstrated that it is still obedient to Moscow, when it requested the intervention of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), controlled by Russia.
Regarding the ""denazification"" narrative, it should be noted that the extreme right does not represent a notable political force in any of the mentioned states and in none of them was there a ""Nazi"" government after the Second World War. It should be noted that the European extreme right was cultivated even by the Kremlin, which maintained ties with the German AfD, the National Assembly led by Marine Le Pen, or Matteo Salvini's Northern League.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: Kiev qualified this statement as proof that the Russian Federation does not intend to stop in Ukraine. ""Everything is just beginning. The Russians sincerely promise that a lot of blood will flow in Europe"", commented the adviser of the Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelensky, Mihail Podoleak, quoted by Korrespondent.net.

The false narrative was spread in Romania by Sorin Rosca Stanescu in Cozmin Gusa's show. Both previously promoted disinformation and fake news and had positions similar to those of Russia.
NEWS: ""Journalist Sorin Rosca Stanescu declared in the program Ce i in Gusa, and in Capusa that: ""The idea that the Black Sea can be blown up is not old at all. There are deposits of toxic and dangerous substances there, and now, with these mines planted, the risk has increased exponentially.""
Several riparian states have warned about the danger that the mines placed in the northwestern area of ​​the Black Sea can represent. The mines come from the coast of Odessa, the main port of Ukraine on the Black Sea, and some experts believe that they are part of the defensive device placed by the Ukrainian army to prevent the landing of Russian troops in this city.
On Tuesday, March 22, some of these mines are allowed to circulate freely on the Black Sea. Leaving the net in which they were fixed, they circulate freely in the Black Sea near the coasts of Ukraine, Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania.
Sorin Rosca Stanescu recalls an article published in the Soviet military press during the Cold War in which a general would have written that the Russians were then prepared, in case of an atomic war, to resort to a very dangerous weapon. ""This is about the ultimate weapon, namely the explosion of the Black Sea"" - says the journalist.
[...]
The journalist poses the problem of commercial ships traveling at sea that can be put in danger, if the mines are not fished out and withdrawn in time. Also, traffic through the ports would be difficult."" NARRATIVE: Ukraine could cause a catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions in the Black Sea due to the launch of some naval mines.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: One month after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian army has not achieved any notable military success. Most of the big cities are under the control of the Ukrainian forces, and Russia seems to have changed its initial tactic, which seemed to rely on blitzkrieg, in favor of a siege and bombardment of the cities, including civilian areas. The goal is to sow fear among the Ukrainian population so that they put pressure on the political and military power to accept the peace conditions that Russia wants to impose.
As far as the southern region of Odessa is concerned, the Russian military has not made progress in the field for a long time. A real fortress was formed around the city, both land and naval. The Russians cannot penetrate these two ways, and the landing attempts were quickly foiled by the Ukrainian forces. Defense measures for Odessa and the Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea include the placement of mines.
The narrative regarding the danger of an explosion of the Black Sea was launched on Cozmin Gusa's show by the former journalist, Sorin Rosca Stanescu. Both characters had, over time, public positions similar to those of Russian propaganda. Cozmin Gusa was involved, since the beginning of the war, in spreading some anti-Ukrainian narratives in Romania. Sorin Rosca Stanescu, for his part, was one of the promoters of this type of narrative, even saying that Romania would risk a war with Russia because of Ukraine. Rosca Stanescu does not have any special training in the military or environmental field to have the competence to approach such topics that must be explained scientifically and militarily.
Sorin Rosca Stanescu launched in Romania the narrative regarding a danger in the Black Sea shortly after the Russian news agency TASS launched a news regarding an alleged danger generated by Ukrainian mines.
Rosca Stanescu did not mention anything in her speech on Gold FM about who launched this hypothesis, precisely so as not to discredit it as a Russian disinformation operation.
 
OBJECTIVE: Scare the population and generate a feeling of hostility towards Ukraine. Obtaining a public pressure that would cause the authorities to, in turn, press for the removal of the mines, which would benefit Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: ""Russian claims about Ukrainian mines floating in the Black Sea could be more a matter of complicating navigation and instilling fear than a real threat,"" said the head of the Bulgarian Naval Forces, Admiral Kiril Mihailov.
Three days ago, Romania also sent the minesweeper ""Vice Admiral Constantin Balescu"" to the Black Sea with the mission to conduct research in Romanian territorial waters, but the ship did not report that it had found any such mines.
Veridica also spoke with military experts from Chisinau who explained that the probability of such mines breaking loose from the place of fixation is very small.
""First of all, taking into account the fact that the information was released by the Russians (from Novorossiysk, not far from Odessa), it could be fake news, in the style of the Russians. In addition, Romania and Bulgaria did not report on the attestation of some drifted mines. I don't know Turkey's position.
According to specialists, it is very difficult to detach them from the place of planting, even in stormy conditions. It remains for me to assume that it is only a subversive plan of the Russians: to throw mines adrift in order to make commercial navigation on the Black Sea difficult"", declared, under the protection of anonymity, a high-ranking officer from the army of the Republic of Moldova.
The theory regarding the explosion of the Black Sea was launched during the Soviet period, as Sorin Rosca Stanescu also said, but it has been dismantled for more than three decades. In fact, naval warfare has been fought in the Black Sea over time, mines have also been used, countless explosions have occurred and no cataclysmic event has taken place - or at least one that suggests that it could happen something. There is indeed hydrogen sulfide in the Black Sea, but for it to cause a cataclysm, a massive event would be needed - an impact with an asteroid of at least 250 meters in diameter or a nuclear explosion.

The narrative is meant to divert attention from the fact that the Russian army massively bombed the city, without taking into account the fact that it kills civilians or the destruction caused.
NEWS: ""Ukrainian soldiers were intentionally destroying houses in Mariupol, firing tanks at them, as a result several floors were set on fire at the same time,"" said Roman Filimonov, a resident of the city, who was an eyewitness of what happened. [...]
Following the chaos created by the Ukrainian nationalists in the city of Mariupol, a terrible humanitarian catastrophe is taking place, the head of the National Defense Organization Center of the Russian Federation, colonel-general Mihail Mizentev, declared at a press conference. Desperate gangs, realizing the impossibility of real help from Kiev, organized a real terror in the neighborhoods they still control"".
NARRATIVE: The city of Mariupol was destroyed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The journalists from RIA NOVOSTI quote the ""witness"" Roman Filimonov, but do not specify who he is, when he told the story, to whom he told the story. Nothing is said about which street it is about and when it would have taken place the incident. In other media, including Russian or local ones, nothing is mentioned about the alleged attacks of the Ukrainian army on the city which, in fact, it is defending.
The false narrative built on the basis of a single untruthful ""testimony"" is completed with a statement by a Russian official, who accuses the Ukrainian military of being ""nationalist gangs"" and of burning and destroying the city of Mariupol. The statement is meaningless, given that for the defenders of a city it is important to preserve as many infrastructure objectives as possible to rely on during defensive efforts - and the goal of any army is to protect its population and defend its territory from destructions. These are caused by those invading forces who are not able to advance without the support of heavy weapons, which they use in an attempt to destroy the resistance.
If we monitor the information on the Facebook group of the residents of the city of Mariupol, we notice that no one writes anything about the aggression of the Ukrainian nationalists or about the tanks of the armed forces opening fire on the houses.
International observers and journalists have documented numerous Russian attacks on civilian targets in Donbass, including Mariupol. The world community was shocked by the Russian bombing of the Theater in Mariupol, where around 1,000 people were sheltering. The building was marked as a children's shelter.
Since the beginning of the war, Russian propaganda has been trying to justify the invasion of Ukraine and the bombing of civilian targets, including schools and hospitals. According to a propaganda narrative debunked by Veridica.ro, a Ukrainian attack on the Donbass was imminent, and Kiev is disguising its intentions by deploying soldiers in schools and hospitals. In fact, through such propaganda narratives, Russia admits that it attacked schools, theaters and kindergartens, under the pretext of the need to kill Ukrainian soldiers. Publication / Media:

The denialists of the victims of the war in Ukraine
reuters.com / Mar. 17 2022, ap.com / 12 Mar. 2022
Hard to believe, but there are still users of social networks who question the attack on civilian targets by the Russian army in Ukraine. The author of a post that went viral on Facebook insinuates that, although 26 million Ukrainians own mobile phones and the Internet covers the entire country, there are no raw images to prove the existence of non-combatant victims. Other users go further, suggesting that the Ukrainians are being bombed by their own army. The Reuters agency dismantles the claims, showing that since the beginning of the invasion, a lot of images of civilian targets have been published with various sources, from ordinary citizens to local authorities and journalists. An example is the filming made by British journalists on March 16 at a temporary field hospital in the Kiev region where Ukrainian health workers are treating civilians injured by bombings. Another example comes from the Associated Press agency, which on March 12 caught Russian tanks firing in a residential area of ​​Mariupol, blowing up the balconies of the blocks. Also from Mariupol, the images of the maternity hospital bombed by the Russian army on March 9, when three civilians lost their lives, including a child, went around the world. Meanwhile, the injured pregnant woman caught by the Associated Press cameraman died. The Ukrainian army also released images after the Mariupol attack, including material filmed by Reuters. On Sunday, a surveillance camera recorded the explosion of a projectile that hit a shopping center in the Podil district of the capital Kyiv, resulting in eight deaths. On the other hand, the Bellingcat investigative group created a map that shows in real time the civilian targets hit by the Russian military since the beginning of the war, illustrated with images and information from each such incident denied by Kremlin propaganda.
The resigned Russian journalists overshadow real opponents
euvsdisinfo.eu / Mar. 17 2022
In addition to the wave of international sympathy created, journalist Marina Ovsianikova's brave gesture of defying press censorship by the Kremlin, who protested live on the main channel of Russian television, was preceded or followed by similar but less spectacular actions. Jana Agalakova, the correspondent in Paris of the same television, announced her resignation saying that the reasons are obvious. Similar decisions were made by other prominent journalists from the state-controlled press. Lilia Gildeeva, presenter of the station with national coverage NTV, announced her resignation after fleeing abroad. Ivan Urgant, who protested since the beginning of the war, also resigned from Channel 1. Maria Baronova, editor in charge of Russia Today television, left her post immediately after the start of the invasion. The Euvsdisinfo portal notes that, starting last month, more than 150 journalists have left Russia, in an exodus reminiscent of the massive departures of 2014, when several important journalists from Russia Today resigned in protest against the attack on Crimea. However, it is to be expected that even now the massive departures will not affect the Kremlin's propaganda apparatus. Moreover, the Russian nationalist publications welcomed the journalists' resignations as an act of purification of the newsrooms that get rid of such cowards and traitors.
The daily Zavtra qualifies Marina Ovsianikova's protest as an act of provocation - I quote - ""disgusting, anti-Russian and pro-Nazi"". For the Tsargrad website, Ovsianikova's action is the pretext for launching a call for the immediate purge of the Russian media. On the other hand on the other hand, official Ukrainian sources warn about the excessive attention the world pays to individual protests like that of Ovsianikova, at the expense of the real victims of the war. In context, euvsdisinfo notes that, despite the drama of Marina Ovsianikova's live protest, the real heroes of the opposition from Russia there are first those assassinated, such as Boris Nemtov and Anna Politkovskaia, then those poisoned, such as Alexei Navalnai and Vladimir Kara-Murza.Added to them are the nearly 15,000 Russian anti-war protesters arrested since February 24.
The Putin-Zelensky war in the ""deep fake"" category
dw.com / 18 Mar. 2022
Fake videos featuring presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky flooded social networks. Created rudimentarily with the ""deep fake"" technique - which allows the projection of the appearance that a person says or does something untrue - and accompanied by unbelievable messages favorable to the opponents, the clips nevertheless became viral on social networks. The journalists from Deutsche Welle stopped firstly on the hoax distributed in March in which the Russian president appears to urge his soldiers to surrender their weapons and return home. Moreover, the hoax attributes other incredible claims to Putin, such as accepting the return of Crimea to Ukraine, recognizing by Russia of the internationally recognized Ukrainian borders, including the territories of Luhansk and Donetsk, and even the establishment of a foundation together with the United States and the European Union for the rehabilitation of the infrastructure in Donbas. The original speech that was the basis of the fake dates from February 21 and it referred to Russia's recognition of the independence of the two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine. The fake in which the president appears attributes to him an equally fanciful message: the call to the army to surrender with all weapons to the Russian invaders. Obviously, Volodymyr Zelensky never sent such a message. Besides, a careful look reveals a lot of technical imperfections that betray a primitive fake.
Russian propaganda at its peak, ""down to the grass""
euvsdisinfo.eu / 19 Mar. 2022
The first propagandist of Russia, the decision-maker of the start of the war against Ukraine, held a ""closed house"" performance on March 18 at the country's largest football stadium, Luzhniki. The euvsdisnfo portal describes the role played by Vladimir Putin in front of a hundred thousands of viewers as being that of the ""Nazi trainer"". In fact, Putin delivered his monologue dedicated to the eight years since the annexation of Crimea on a stage above which the slogan ""For a world without Nazism"" hung. Cynically, he persistently repeated the two keywords he used to justify in the speech of February 24, the invasion of Ukraine: ""genocide"" and ""Nazism"". Analysts from euvsdisinfo.eu emphasize the lack of logic of the ""Nazi state"" label given to Ukraine, in the conditions that Volodymyr Zelensky - the democratically elected president with over 73% of the votes - he is a Jew descended from a family that paid tribute to the Holocaust. On the other hand, the Kremlin's propaganda does not hesitate to classify as a ""Nazi"" or a Nazi sympathizer any critic of Moscow's geopolitical project of unifying the Russian-speaking world - the so-called ""Ruskii Mir"". The preferred targets are Poland and the Baltic states, but even Italy has not escaped the terminological association with Nazism. The novelty is that the obsession with Nazism has become dominant in the state-controlled Russian press. For the editor-in-chief of Russia Today, the European Union as a whole is ""Nazi"". The adjective ""Nazi"" dominated Vladimir Putin's vocabulary and became indispensable in Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's references to Ukraine. On March 4, when the Russian parliament adopted draconian measures against the independent press and freedom of expression, the word ""Nazism"" was recurring in a mock debate. In fact, in Moscow's view, the entire West has become ""Nazi"" because it supports Ukraine in the face of invasion. Analysts are of the opinion that this tireless rhetoric centered on ""Nazism"" is not destined to succeed internationally, being intended rather for Russian citizens. Vladimir Putin's goal would be to divert attention from the obvious weaknesses of his own regime and convince the population that Russia he has in front of him an unscrupulous imaginary enemy. And even if not all Russians will be convinced to fight the enemy indicated by the Kremlin, the elimination of any domestic objection to the war would be a win for Putin, who has given a true proof of the cult of personalities at the Moscow stadium - euvsdisinfo concludes.

NEWS: ""Ukrainian Nazis from the ""Azov"" battalion are planning to organize a terrorist attack in Lviv against US diplomats and blame the Russian military, said the representative of the Ministry of Defense, Major General Igor Konasenkov.
During a briefing, he said that during the special operation, a collaborator of the State Security Service from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions surrendered to the Russian Armed Forces.
""I want to emphasize that the regime in Kiev knows the plans of the nationalists, but does not take any measures to block their realization. The nationalist regime in Kiev is planning to attack the diplomatic objectives of the US and other Western states and present them as direct offensives by the Russian Armed Forces,"" said the general. According to him, the purpose of this provocation is to ""increase pressure on NATO states"" to close the airspace over Ukraine and provide additional weaponry"".
[...]
According to the statements of the Ministry of Defense, the Armed Forces are only hitting the military infrastructure and the positions of the Ukrainian army.""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine will attack the US embassy in Lviv and blame Russia in order to draw NATO into the war.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Ukraine has never attacked civilian targets or buildings of diplomatic representatives on its territory or on Russian territory. Kiev tried and is still trying to obtain the imposition of an air exclusion zone by NATO, a request rejected by the Allies because it would imply the involvement of the North Atlantic Alliance in a direct war with Russia. Beyond refusing involvement at this level, NATO states support Ukraine politically and economically, have adopted severe sanctions against Russia and have even provided significant amounts of weaponry, including portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems that have been used extremely effective against Russian forces. Losing this support following a fake attack would be extremely costly for Ukraine. An offensive or a bombardment by Russia cannot be ""directed"" under the conditions in which the allied forces intensively monitor the border area, so that they would immediately identify troop movements and the place of origin of some attacks.
On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that Russia is already planning a series of air attacks on the cities of western Ukraine, preparing through such propaganda narratives the internal public opinion for a possible expansion of the conflict and an invasion of the neighboring regions with NATO and EU member states.
Veridica has already dismantled a series of false narratives about the involvement of nationalist forces in the destabilization of the situation in Ukraine, including that they escaped from the control of the authorities. Nationalist battalions and other paramilitary groups were disbanded by Kiev starting in 2016, and the last independent fighting units were incorporated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2019.
The Azov Battalion, which originates from a far-right militia, is used by Russia to justify its excesses: in Mariupol, for example, where this unit's main area of ​​operations is, Moscow lied that Azov fighters had located in a maternity hospital and a theater, both bombed by his forces.

The narrative is used alongside older propaganda messages, according to which Moscow is conducting a special military operation and protecting civilians, whom Kiev is using as human shields.
NEWS: ""The Ukrainian side is delaying finding a peaceful solution in Ukraine. The representatives of the Ukrainian authorities want the war to last as long as possible, because they want to fight, the representative of the People's Militia DNR, Eduard Basurin, told URA.RU [...] The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has lost control over the Armed Forces and nationalist battalions , according to the Federal News Agency.
After the escalation of the eight-year conflict on the territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the president of the Russian Federation decided to carry out a special operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine. The Russian side does not attack civilians in Ukraine, while the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not allow refugees to leave the cities, using them as human shields.""
NARRATIVE: Ukraine wants to prolong the war and uses its citizens as human shields, while Russia protects Ukrainian civilians.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, under the pretext of denazification and demilitarization, Russia invaded Ukraine, attacked and bombed the country's cities, killing civilians and causing significant damage. Residential buildings, kindergartens, schools, medical centers were destroyed, and among the victims of the attacks were children, women, and elderly people, a fact documented by journalists, diplomats and observers from all over the world. Social networks present people's accounts of Russia's war crimes. The statement about Moscow's concern for civilians is just propaganda that cannot be proven by the reality on the ground. Since it is increasingly difficult for the Russian media to hide the truth about the destruction and victims in Ukraine, the narrative about civilians being used as human shields by the Ukrainian military is increasingly being used.
Veridica recently dismantled a Russian propaganda narrative, according to which Ukraine was preparing to attack the Donbass and masked its intentions by hiding soldiers in schools and hospitals; basically, Russia has admitted that it has bombed such targets. Countless images from the scene, testimonies of surviving victims, findings of international organizations, show unequivocally that the schools and other civilian targets did not belong to the Ukrainian army and were clearly marked as civilian targets, so nothing could have led to the conclusion that they are used by the army; it is obvious that Russia targeted them intentionally.
It is also not true that the Presidency in Kiev would have lost control over some nationalist battalions. In reality, there are no battalions not controlled by Ukraine at the moment. There are hundreds of territorial defense units, well organized, which manage to oppose the resistance of the Russian army. Nationalist battalions and other paramilitary groups were disbanded by Kiev starting in 2016, and the last independent fighting units were incorporated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2019.
Regarding the alleged intention of Kiev to continue the war, the peace proposed by the leaders of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk would, in fact, mean a capitulation of the Ukrainian leadership to invaders. Russia also wants to force, by means of weapons, Ukraine to become a vassal state, to conduct its politics as Moscow wants, to cede to it a series of territories it has occupied (Crimea, Donbass), to give up any security guarantees and armed forces, which would keep it constantly vulnerable. Basically, it is a capitulation again. The leadership of Ukraine is accused of wanting war precisely because it resists the invasion of a foreign force and refuses to surrender unconditionally.
This propaganda narrative aims to accustom the public opinion in Russia that the application of military force against neighbors is something normal, which reminds us of the concept of just and unjust war from the USSR period: ""A just war is the one waged by the Soviet state , and an unjust one is the one carried against him"".

Through such messages, launched after the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow suggests that the Russians would be discriminated against to intimidate countries like the Republic of Moldova, but also to discourage their citizens who want to leave the country.
NEWS: During the month of March, on the social media pages of Russian diplomatic missions in several countries, Russian citizens were invited to inform the embassies if they are discriminated against. ""We ask Russian citizens and compatriots who are subject to discrimination on grounds of nationality, language, culture, religion, if they have been victims of violence or have been threatened, to contact the Embassy's special email address,"" the message reads. in Russian published on the Facebook page of the Russian embassy in Bucharest on March 11.
Five days later, similar messages were published on the pages of the Russian embassies in Chisinau and Helsinki. NARRATIVE: Russians abroad are discriminated against and tolerance in Western democracies is just a myth.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: The most vulnerable in this situation is the Republic of Moldova, a small and poor state, with society divided including on ethnic, linguistic and foreign policy criteria, which also faces a secessionist conflict in the east, the region being controlled, de facto by Moscow, which also has a military contingent there that, officially, guards a warehouse with weapons and ammunition from the Soviet era.
The Republic of Moldova is seen as a potential next target of Russia after Ukraine, and the Russian embassy's message aims to justify the extension of the ""denazification"" operation, commented jurist Alexandru Tanase, former president of the Constitutional Court. And other experts commented on the message of Russian diplomacy as a challenge.
The Finnish expert Jussi Lassila told the local media that in the conditions in which Russia lost the information war in favor of Ukraine and has fewer and fewer partners abroad, it is trying to justify the war among its citizens who have left the country, even if it is assumed that many of they don't support him.
OBJECTIVE: A large number of complaints (documented or not), could be invoked by Moscow to justify possible actions aimed at defending its fellow citizens. Intimidation of the states in which these appeals were launched, so that they do not align with the Western position of sanctioning Russia and denunciation. In the case of the Republic of Moldova and/or Finland, the complaints could serve as reasons for pressure on the Russian minorities to be granted additional rights/privileges. The approach conveys, at the same time, to Russian citizens that Moscow remains strong and is able to defend them, but also that, if they leave their country, once they get out, they risk being marginalized.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The undermining of the rights of the Russian and Russophone minority in the Republic of Moldova is one of the permanent messages of Moscow, the Russian media, and some local politicians. In the Republic of Moldova, Russians represent approximately 4% of the population (calculations do not refer to the Transnistrian region), and 20% represent Russian-speaking national minorities. Russian has the status of an interethnic communication language, it is studied in schools. Approximately 20% of schools in the Republic of Moldova are taught in Russian or mixed.
Romania and Finland, in turn, are recognized countries for respecting the rights of minorities.
NUTS OF TRUTH: Because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, public opinion in several countries has become more critical of the Russians. But that attitude is primarily aimed at the Russian rulers, it is motivated by the war and has no ethnic, linguistic or religious basis
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: In the Republic of Moldova, there were no cases of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, and the message of the Russian Embassy does not contribute to maintaining calm in society, commented the Embassy's message, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration from Chisinau, Daniel Voda,, This post does not contribute to the atmosphere of calm in our society and we ask the partners to refrain from such gestures and to show evidence of a better assessment of the situation in our country.
We want to emphasize that in our country the rights of all residents are guaranteed, the Republic of Moldova being a model in the region for peaceful and safe coexistence among all its residents, regardless of their assumed ethnic origin.
In this context, we bring to your attention that there were no cases of discrimination recorded in any form, especially on ethnic criteria, the Republic of Moldova being guided by solid, European mechanisms to prevent discrimination"", wrote Daniel Voda.

It presents Russia as a state that, through the ""special military operation"" in Donbass, freed the local population and expelled the ""Nazis"" and ""nationalists"".
NEWS: ""Izvestia"" correspondent, Ivan Litomin, was in the concentration camp of the nationalist battalion ""Aidar"" (an organization banned in the Russian Federation) and filmed the secret prison of Ukrainian nationalists.
The concentration camp is located in the village of Polovinkovo, Starobelsk district, LNR. For torture and interrogation, the ""Aidarovists"" chose a sausage factory with a high concrete fence [...] Practically no one survived.
REN TV also published images from this secret prison of the Aidar battalion. According to witnesses, people were not only kept here in cold and damp rooms, but were also doused with ice-cold water to minimize their chance of survival. Here were brought not only prisoners of war from the Donetsk People's Republic, but also civilians who sympathized with the independent republics.""
NARRATIVE: Russia discovered a concentration camp in eastern Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The ""Aidar"" battalion, initially made up of volunteers and acting as a paramilitary group, fought against pro-Russian forces in the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014-2015. The presence of this battalion in Donbass was noted and monitored by observers from the OSCE, the UN and other international organizations; some of which drew attention to the fact that various paramilitary groups were not part of the regular Armed Forces of Kyiv. Since 2016, Ukraine has taken measures and included all paramilitary units in the national defense system.
While Aidar's presence in Donbass was confirmed, no international organization that had observers in the region found the existence of concentration camps in eastern Ukraine, as evidenced by the reports published quarterly by the OSCE.
In addition, the Russian press contradicts itself: on the one hand, it writes that no one managed to survive the unbearable tortures, but some online newspapers, including Izvestia, published a series of interviews with the survivors of this concentration camp, organized, faces, according to the Nazi model.
In other words, on the one hand, the camps were secret, no one knew about them and no one survived them, and on the other hand, there are many witnesses and survivors from 2014, some of them refugees in Russia, but Moscow he only now found out about them and their testimonies.
It should also be noted that no television station or news portal published images of concentration camp survivors. Only their names and testimonies are cited, which raises a series of questions regarding the veracity of the information.
Finally, the location of concentration camps near the demarcation line is not logical. Usually, secret prisons are not established near the front, but in places that are more difficult to access.
In reality, Russian TV stations found former training centers of volunteer groups in Donbass from 2014-2015 and constructed propaganda narratives to find new justifications in front of domestic public opinion for the invasion of Ukraine. Publication / Media:

According to a recent narrative, a Ukrainian attack on Donbass was imminent, and Kiev is masking its intentions by deploying soldiers in schools and hospitals.
NEWS: The first deputy of the Minister of Information of the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) Daniil Bezsonov told RT that he came into possession of a report of the battalion chiefs no. 105 and 109 of the Territorial Defense. These were kept in electronic format at the military commissariats in Volnovaha.
According to Bezsonov, the report shows that the Territorial Defense Units were deployed in municipal objectives, including schools. He specified that the medical institutions were used to treat the wounded, the sick and the children were forced to leave the hospitals. [...] ""These are second line units to support the offensive against us. These data confirm that the Ukrainian side was preparing an offensive against Donbass in advance,"" he said. The Russian Foreign Ministry once called the bombing of Donetsk with Tocika-U missiles by the Ukrainian military a crime against humanity.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine was preparing an offensive in Donbass, and Ukrainian troops were deployed in schools, hospitals and other civilian targets.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Russian publications have attached a series of documents on Telegram channels, which would have proven that Moscow saved the Donbass from genocide through its military operation to de-Nazify Ukraine. If we analyze the documents in Ukrainian presented as evidence, we notice that it is a simple conversation between Ukrainian soldiers, an exchange of information between the Ukrainian army and the battalion from Volnovaha. There is no information about an alleged plan to attack Donetsk or Luhansk. In the reports presented as secret, it is mentioned that the Territorial Defense Unit consists of 72 people! Therefore, Kiev proposes to storm Donetsk with a hand of volunteers, who are not even professional soldiers. In addition, the Russian press and the representatives of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk do not remember that the battalion from Volnovaha was there in compliance with the Minsk Peace Agreement, because the distance of 30 km from the demarcation line was respected.
Ukraine tried until the last moment to avoid a war with Russia, given the massive disproportion of forces, so it is absurd that, with 150,000 Russian soldiers mobilized at the borders of the country, Kiev would have taken the irrational decision to attack.
Veridica.ro recently dismantled a series of fake news about an alleged massacre in Donbass, prepared by Ukraine through its territorial defense units. In reality, the Territorial Defense of Ukraine is a new element in the security system, which has no offensive purpose. According to the concept of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the purpose of these Territorial Defense Units is to buy time in case of an attack on any region or city until professional soldiers can be sent to the scene.
Regarding Russia's repeated claims that Ukrainian forces occupied various civilian targets, which would have justified their bombing, countless images from the scene, testimonies of the victims who survived, findings of international organizations, accredited journalists, etc. shows unequivocally that the respective locations did not belong to the army.

NEWS: The Russian Ministry of Defense declared that over 15 million Ukrainians still maintain close ties with Russia. ""Historically, a significant part of the population of Ukraine has always advocated respectable relations with Russia. According to statistics, there are more than 15 million people who still maintain strong ties with the Russian Federation, where their relatives, acquaintances and friends live"", said Mihail Mizintev, head of the National Center for Defense Administration of the Russian Federation, at a briefing.
According to him, ""first of all, it is the regions of Zaporizhzhya, Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Kirovohrad, Cherkasy, Kiev and Zhytomyr"".
""In the context of a humanitarian crisis, most of the population is forcibly held by nationalists in the cities of Ukraine and used by them as a ""human shield"". They seek protection in Russia, and not in the West, which is confirmed by millions of calls from citizens to the Russian side for help in the evacuation process,"" Mizintev said.
NARRATIVES: 1. Russophones are ""human shields"" for Ukrainian nationalists. 2. 15 million Ukrainians have close ties to Russia
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Russian Ministry of Defense does not cite data from opinion polls and does not present evidence to support the claim that 15 million Ukrainians have close ties with Russia and pleads for a renewal of relations with Moscow.
The images from the south and east of Ukraine, presented by journalists from the West, with thousands of Russian speakers protesting against the occupying forces, demonstrate that Ukrainians, regardless of ethnicity and the language they speak, reject the geopolitical project of restoring the ""Russian world"". opinion polls in Ukraine, carried out before the outbreak of the war, show that only a third of Ukrainians had a positive attitude towards Russia.
Sociological studies conducted after the launch of Russia's war against Ukraine show that 86% of Ukrainians want the recovery of Crimea and the liberation of Donbass in the near future.
According to UN reports, only 5% of Ukrainian refugees chose Russia, and the other 95% - Western countries. Therefore, Ukrainians seek support and shelter in the West because they are attacked and killed by the Russian army. Among the refugees in Russia, the majority come from territories controlled by it and had no alternatives after the outbreak of the conflict.
The argument regarding the blocking of Russian speakers in the cities, by the Ukrainian forces, to be used as human shields, is contradicted by the realities on the ground: Ukraine constantly pleaded for the formation of humanitarian corridors, and when it was possible, tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the besieged cities. However, there were also incidents when the Russian forces made it impossible to use the corridors, opening fire against the convoys. The Russians are the ones besieging the cities and have prevented the civilians from leaving them. Finally, since the beginning of the war, the Russian forces have bombed numerous civilian targets, including residential buildings, where there were no soldiers present, which disproves, once again, the narrative of human shields.

Pro-Russian ""volunteers"" vs pro-Ukrainian ""mercenaries"".
tass.com / 6 Mar. 2022, bbc.com / 12 Mar. 2022
The double measure used in similar or comparable situations by pro-Kremlin propaganda is well known. The war in Ukraine reveals a new proof of hypocrisy. A week after the beginning of the invasion, the spokesman of the Russian Ministry of Defense warns that the thousands of Westerners who chose to fight on the Ukrainian side, whom he called ""mercenaries"", will not benefit from the protection conferred by international humanitarian law and will not they will receive the status of prisoners of war. Igor Konasenko threatened that, in the best case, foreign fighters captured in Ukraine will be tried as criminals. Ten days later, at the meeting of the Security Council of Russia, Vladimir Putin practically invites foreign citizens to join the Russian army's intervention in Ukraine as volunteers. In the same meeting, the Russian Minister of Defense estimated at 16,000 the number of volunteers from the Middle East willing to enlist in Moscow's camp. According to American officials quoted by the BBC, among them there would be many Syrians with experience in urban guerrilla warfare.
Fake fake takedown site
dw.com / 9 Mar. 2022
Russian propaganda does not mean only crude mystifications, but can also take on sophisticated forms. Deutsche Welle has discovered that a website called ""War on fakes"" is distributing false information attributed to the Ukrainian media in order to spread Kremlin disinformation. The journalists noticed that the site, founded on March 1, publishes analyzes in English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese, but not in Russian, which shows that it targets an international audience. The original version in Russian, as well as the associated Telegram account, are somewhat older. The Telegram account was opened on February 23, a day before the start of the invasion, and has over 625,000 subscribers and more than 30 million daily views. Both the English version and the Russian version are intensively promoted on social networks by propaganda publications such as Russia Today, as well as by Russian embassies, such as the one in Paris. The trick used by the site's operators involves the dismantling of fake news, including those promoted by the Ukrainian side, after which, against the background of the verification, propaganda elements are introduced. German journalists have not managed to find out who is behind the website ""War on fakes"", but they say that its sudden appearance and its rapid development, correlated with the massive support it enjoys from the pro-Kremlin media, raise signs questioning its origin and influence...
The nuclear fantasy, the weapon of mass disinformation
euvsdisinfo.eu / 10 Mar. 2022
From the Russian disinformation regarding the Ukrainian biological arsenal to the one regarding the imminent production of the atomic bomb by Kiev, it was only one step. Ten days after the start of the invasion of the neighboring country, the Russian news agency TASS evokes the imminent manufacture by Ukraine of an explosive device based on plutonium secretly extracted from spent nuclear fuel. The news was picked up by Russia Today and the Ria agency, which added, stating that the plutonium would have been transferred from the United States. Moreover, pro-Kremlin publications insisted that Ukraine destroyed or hid part of the documents related to the development of nuclear weapons. Russia Today and Vzglead launched the theory that the armed lockout at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant was determined by secret documents stored there. However, Moscow's nuclear fantasy went even further, with some publications stating that Ukraine is already prepared to resort to nuclear weapons. Lenta, Gazeta, Tsargrad, Regnum and Sputnik, joined by the accounts of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Embassy in Madrid, promoted the scenario in which the Ukrainian Security Service, aided by militants of the Azov battalion, is planning an action causing radioactive contamination in the Kharkiv region. The daily Pravda added its own scenario to the diversion, suggesting nothing more and nothing less than the nuclear involvement of NATO, which would use Ukraine as a ""Trojan horse"" for an atomic attack on Russia.
""Denazification"" of a Ukrainian maternity hospital
news.un.org / 11 Mar. 2022, reuters.com / 10 Mar. 2022, france24.com / 10 Mar. 2022
On March 11, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed its concern over the increase in the number of civilian victims in the war in Ukraine and warned Russia that deliberate attacks on the non-combatant population fall into the category of war crimes. The responses of Moscow officials to the accusations of repeated - and proven - violations of the commitment to avoid civilian targets oscillate, depending on the source, between aggressive denials, ambiguous explanations and false arguments. This is the case of the bombing of the maternity hospital in Mariupol on March 9, an attack that resulted in three deaths, including a child. Questioned about the incident, Kremlin spokeswoman Dmitri Peskov bluntly stated that the Russian army does not target civilian targets. A day later, the Russian Minister of Defense categorically denied the presence of Russian planes in the region and spoke of ""a Ukrainian provocation"". The spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry went further, qualifying the news as fake news and a form of informational terrorism"". Sergei Lavrov came up with a totally different version: according to the head of Russian diplomacy, the maternity building - from which the doctors and patients were allegedly evacuated days ago - would have been occupied by Ukrainian ultra-radical forces. The same explanation was taken by the Russian ambassador in London, who shared on Twitter the image of a pregnant woman in the bombed hospital over which he applied the inscription ""fake"". At the request of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the post was removed for violating the rules of the community. a few days before, in Paris, when asked in a television program who is bombing civilians in Ukraine, the spokesman of the Russian embassy answered with a smile that the responsibility belongs to the Ukrainian Nazi battalions.
The false pretext of Ukrainian biological weapons
bbc.com / 12 Mar. 2022
One of the pretexts recently invoked by Moscow for the war in Ukraine - which Russian propaganda insists on calling a ""special operation"" - is the danger of alleged biological weapons designed in 30 Ukrainian laboratories, with financial and technical support from Washington. Journalists from BBC News have checked whether there is evidence to support the accusations brought by the Kremlin and amplified by China, including in the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council last week. A first finding is that the laboratories in Ukraine, some logistically supported - as and those from other countries - by the United States, the European Union and the World Health Organization, serve to study pathogens and microorganisms in order to prevent diseases. Their ""secret"" character proclaimed by Russia is contradicted, for example, by the detailed data published on the website of the American embassy in Kyiv. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States launched a ""Biological Threat Reduction Program"" in the new states inheriting the biochemical arsenal of the former USSR. Since 2005, the US Department of Defense has been collaborating with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to combat the emergence and spread of the most dangerous infectious diseases. In other words, the purpose of Ukrainian laboratories is to protect the population from biological attacks, not to produce such weapons. Another theory launched by Moscow - that of the Ukrainians' untimely destruction of pathogens in the laboratories to hide the evidence an activity prohibited by international conventions - is dismantled by the explanations of the World Health Organization. WHO experts recommended Ukraine to destroy high-risk pathogens in order to avoid their spread among the population in the conditions of insecurity caused by Russia's military aggression. On the other hand , the United States has warned that the Ukrainian biological weapons story could be a diversion to mask Russia's intention to use such weapons in the war it has provoked.

The fake news is promoted by publications and characters - some associated with the extreme right - who over time have published disinformation, fake news and narratives similar to those of Russia.
NEWS: ""On March 3, 2022, a MiG-21 plane of the Romanian Air Force, taken off from the Mihail Kogalniceanu base for an air patrol mission over Dobrogea, and an IAR 330-Puma helicopter sent on a mission by rescue, all 8 soldiers involved in the tragedy dying.
The Romanian authorities claimed that it was an accident.
Well, it's not like that. According to the specialized website Military Watch Magazine, the two Romanian military aircraft were mistakenly shot down by the S-300 anti-aircraft defense systems of Ukraine.
They say it's accidental, but if we still wake up with a Russian missile, then how will they consider it? Can we rely on the defense of NATO, which allows drones to fly unimpeded on the territory of Romania?"", the news from the ortodoxinfo.ro portal shows.
NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine shot down two aircraft of the Romanian Air Force. 2. NATO could go to war with Ukraine based on Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Against the background of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, called by Moscow a ""special operation"" for the ""demilitarization"" and ""denazification"" of Ukraine, a real informational war is also being waged, which goes from aggressive propaganda to disinformation and fake news.
One of the methods consists in denigrating and discrediting Ukraine and Ukrainians by promoting negative narratives about them, with the aim of attracting attention from, but also trivializing the numerous abuses and crimes committed by the Russian army and inducing sensation.
Despite the closure of some of the Kremlin's official propaganda media channels, such as Sputnik and Russia Today, agents or sympathizers of Russia still have alternatives to expose their narratives, including on social networks, even if some of the latter have taken measures to limitation of Russian propaganda recently.
The fake news regarding the downing of a plane and a helicopter of the Romanian Air Force starts from real events that took place on March 2. Then, shortly after 8 p.m., a MiG 21 Lancer fighter jet patrolling over Dobrogea crashed. An IAR-330 Puma rescue helicopter sent to search for the pilot also crashed shortly after takeoff. Eight soldiers - the MiG pilot and the seven Puma crew members - lost their lives in a double aviation tragedy. This took place in the dark and in unfavorable weather conditions, and the Romanian army used, until now, the term ""accident"" when referring to the incidents.
The information that the devices were shot down by the Ukrainian anti-aircraft initially appeared on the website with pro-Moscow content militarywatch.com, and from there it was taken over by Romanian sources who in the past promoted theses similar to those of Russian disinformation on topics such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the traditional family, Orthodoxy, sovereignty, etc.
One of the first sites that picked up the false information was rostonline.ro, the nationalist magazine with legionary tendencies led in the past by the AUR senator, Claudiu Tarziu. Later, the news was picked up by ortodoxinfo.ro, a nationalist, conservative and anti-EU and NATO website, full of pro-Kremlin propaganda by virtue of the so-called common Christian values ​​between Romania and Russia.
Only late, after the MApN denial, the ortodoxinfo.ro website updated its fake news with a short passage from the ROAF press release, but not the title, which remained the same: ""Ukraine shot down the two Romanian aircraft, of which resulted in 8 deaths"", followed by the subtitle ""Romania has already been attacked by Ukraine. Will NATO resort to Article 5?"" The fake news has been viewed, up to the date of publication of this article, more than 120,000 times.
Also, Catalin Bereghi, a nationalist character who frequently propagates the kind of sovereignist and nationalist theses promoted by Russia, also published a video in which the militarywatch.com thesis is repeated, which at the time of publication was approaching 600,000 views, 11,000 shares and 1500 comments.
OBJECTIVE: Exploiting the fears of a part of the population that Romania could be drawn into a war. Misleading the public through false information and creating an anti-Ukrainian feeling in Romania.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Romanian Air Force denied the information released on militarywatch.com:
""The statement is completely false. The ""information"" referred to is nothing more than disinformation from the Russian online media and has nothing to do with real facts or events. The Ministry of National Defense communicated with maximum transparency the information related to the two accidents. By order to the Minister of National Defense, a technical investigation commission was appointed to investigate the circumstances of these aviation accidents. At the same time, according to the procedures, the Military Prosecutor's Office was notified and training flights with these types of aircraft were stopped, until the completion of the specialized investigation"". The source also specified that following the checks carried out up to this point by the investigative commission, ""no elements were found that indicate a possible impact with a projectile or missile"".
Moreover, militarywatch.com does not cite any source for its information, nor does it prove it in any way. The publication only writes that ""it was reported"" and claims that its audience will believe it.
The article was taken up in Romania including a mistake regarding the date of the plane crash, which took place on March 2 and not March 3, as militarywatch mentions; those who took it over did not seek to verify the information from several sources and, from the Veridica data, there is no request for information or denial/confirmation from the MApN.
Considering the war in Ukraine, the airspace of the region, including in Romania, is heavily monitored, and a launch of anti-aircraft missiles would certainly have been detected instantly, which did not happen.
Regarding the involvement of NATO in a war against Ukraine in response to an attack by it, the hypothesis is excluded. NATO states are the main supporters of Kiev, both through direct deliveries of weapons and ammunition, and through economic measures taken against the Russian Federation. There is no unimaginable reason for a Ukrainian suicide attack on NATO and even if, as a result of a confusion specific to the war, an episode of ""friendly fire"" took place, it would be treated as a regrettable accident, not as a pretext to trigger a conflict.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Air Force within MApN has refuted the false information published by websites that promote nationalist narratives in Romania that frequently overlap with those of pro-Russian propaganda. Publication / Media:

[...] ""I say again, they were not only preparing to strike Donbass, but they built positions to strike Belarus"", declared the leader from Minsk.
NARRATIVE: Ukraine was preparing to attack Belarus on the day Russia's special operation was launched.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The purpose of this narrative is to justify the war launched by Russia against Ukraine on February 24 BC. Moreover, Lukasenko explains to the Belarusian public opinion why Russian troops use the territory of his state to attack Ukraine. In reality, Ukraine did not plan to attack Belarus. This, under the pretext of organizing joint war exercises, allowed Russia to bring troops to its territory and invade Ukraine, the main direction of attack being Kiev. With a massive Russian presence on the borders before the war, categorically outnumbered in terms of troops and equipment, Ukraine had no interest in seeking a conflict and would not have had the military capacity to launch a large-scale offensive, let alone attack two countries simultaneously - Russia and Belarus.
Lukasenko's statement can also be seen as a search for a casus belli, necessary for a possible involvement of Minsk in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict - a Belarusian military offensive.
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksii Reznikov, declared that the Russian military is preparing an attack against some localities in Belarus. According to Kiev, Minsk will present this attack to the Belarusians as a provocative action by the ""Ukrainian Nazis"", which requires a military response. Reznikov gave assurances that Ukraine did not plan and does not plan to attack Belarus.
Belarus has already sent 5 tactical battalions to the border with Ukraine, with the stated purpose of patrolling the area, protecting important objectives and ensuring peace in the regions bordering Ukraine. Ukrainian officials believe that the probability of Belarus' involvement in the war on the side of Russia is quite high in the coming days. Publication / Media:

NARRATIVES: 1. The Ukrainian refugees who arrive in the Republic of Moldova show an aggressive behavior towards the local population. 2. Ukraine is trying to draw the Republic of Moldova into the war against Russia
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, approximately 300,000 Ukrainian citizens took refuge in the Republic of Moldova, of which slightly more than 100,000 were still in this country on March 12. The Republic of Moldova is the country that hosts the largest number of Ukrainian refugees, relative to its population (approximately 4% of the total population). However, it is expected that most of the remaining Ukrainians will move further to the West, or will return to the country after the end of the war.
Central and local authorities have created centers for refugees, but a large number are hosted by private individuals. The international community has announced that it will allocate financial support and humanitarian aid for refugees.
The Republic of Moldova condemned the Russian military aggression, but did not join the international sanctions.
Since the beginning of the war, more information has been released about alleged military preparations in the Transnistrian separatist region, de facto controlled by Russia and where a Russian military contingent is stationed and there is a large warehouse of weapons and ammunition from the Soviet era. One of the falsehoods was that Vinita Airport was attacked with missiles launched from Transnistria, but Chisinau, Kiev and Tiraspol also denied these rumors.
A survey carried out at the beginning of March attests that the majority of respondents are on the side of Ukraine in the war launched by Russia, and over 60% condemn the way in which Vladimir Putin manages the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: To discredit the Ukrainians and Ukraine, to fuel the fear of the Republic of Moldova being drawn into the war and to reduce the empathy of the majority of citizens towards the authorities in Kiev who defend themselves against the Russian invasion.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: With the increase in the number of Ukrainian refugees in the Republic of Moldova, an entire campaign to discredit them was launched on social networks and various information appeared - generally false - about their involvement in road accidents, aggressive behavior , etc. Former pro-Russian president Igor Dodon even proposed that Ukrainians ""who do not behave well"" should be sent back or expelled to Romania. Much of this information about the behavior of Ukrainians turns out to be false.
The police denied the involvement of Ukrainians in major road accidents or in cases of serious violations of public order. ""Until today, we have not registered any crime in which the refugees were involved. There are misdemeanors, that is, acts with a less important social and legal danger than a crime. We have, for example, traffic violations"", declared the head of the General Police Inspectorate, Viorel Cernauteanu.
The preparation of the separatist army for involvement in the conflict and even its military actions against Ukraine are other theses promoted on social networks.
The alleged intention to involve the Republic of Moldova in the war it is waging with Russia is a new thesis. The Republic of Moldova, as a neutral country, cannot get involved in a military conflict. In addition, the Republic of Moldova is in a vulnerable situation due to the superiority of the separatist forces combined with the Russian ones in Transnistria, so it is not interested in a war that it would lose. In addition, Ukraine also does not want a new front to be opened in its western part, given that its forces are hardly able to cope with the Russian assaults in the east, north and south.
TRUTH: The police documented several minor violations, including traffic violations, committed by Ukrainian refugees. Publication / Media:

In a letter addressed to the Romanian authorities, Severin, who in recent years promoted sovereignist and anti-Western theses similar to those that appear in the narratives spread by Russia, resumes some of the theses of Russia's war propaganda.
NEWS: ,,In the current conditions, in which the danger of a world war with a nuclear dimension, likely to involve Romania, increases from day to day and from hour to hour, the Romanian government demands: To declare and respect absolute neutrality in the Russian-Russian military conflict Ukrainian. The territory of Romania cannot be used either as a starting point for attacks by a belligerent state against another belligerent state, nor as a place of refuge for the armed forces of one or the other of the belligerents, nor as a source of supply or transit space for arming the belligerents [...] To provide humanitarian assistance to the victims of the war in Ukraine, under the conditions of defending medical security (sick persons must be isolated in appropriate spaces for medical care and avoiding the spread of contagious diseases), social (criminals and violent persons must be isolated in institutions capable of preventing the increase of the criminal phenomenon) and political (intelligence agents and people with political agendas hidden among the refugees must be returned to the places they came from) of the Romanian nation. [...] To request the allies and partners within NATO and the EU to stop the bellicose rhetoric and urgently initiate peace negotiations with the parties in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. [...] To request the UN Secretary General to initiate an international peace conference with the object of resolving the conflict in Ukraine, with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and the states neighboring Ukraine [...] To request the allies and partners within NATO and the EU the urgent identification and the provision of guarantees that would allow Ukraine a safe and free existence, under the conditions of its remaining outside of any military alliances"", writes Correctnews.com.
NARRATIVES: 1. Romania must proclaim its neutrality in the conflict in Ukraine. 2. Romania must convince NATO to negotiate peace in Ukraine. 2. Romania's Western allies have a bellicose rhetoric against Russia. 3. Ukrainian spies and provocateurs would also be among the refugees.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In Adrian Severin's requests, numerous false narratives and theses appear that either appear to be copied from those issued by the Russian Federation, or clearly favor it. In fact, Adrian Severin became known, especially after his prison sentence, precisely for promoting some narratives (sovereignist, anti-Western, etc.) similar to those coming from Moscow and he was accused in the press of being one of Putin's people"" in Bucharest. Veridica has written several times about pro-Russian disinformation promoted by Adrian Severin. And now her requests have been left just one day after Russia presented its demands to the authorities in Kiev, on March 7.
The proposal regarding Romania's ""absolute neutrality"" status ignores the facts that Romania, as a member of a military alliance, is not a neutral state anyway, and coordinates its actions with its NATO allies and EU partners. The idea of ​​a possible NATO military involvement it's pure Russian propaganda. Moscow - by far the most aggressive state in Europe in recent decades - claims that it would be attacked (or in danger of being attacked) by NATO, which is a defensive alliance to which ex-communist countries have attached precisely to be protected from new Russian attacks.
The North Atlantic Alliance did not make bellicose statements towards Russia, but asked it to stop its unjustified invasion on the territory of Ukraine. No public threat from NATO has been issued to Moscow until now. The alliance is not part of this conflict and has nothing to do with its initiation - Russia is the one that invaded a foreign country. The statement with bellicose rhetoric comes, in fact, in the face of more recent Russian propaganda, according to which NATO would have had/prepared bases in Ukraine, and earlier, which tries to accredit the idea that a defensive alliance is aggressive towards an expansionist power .
Last but not least, the fact that among the refugees from Ukraine there are Ukrainian spies who have various agendas is a fact that has not been proven and is part of a campaign, first observed in the Republic of Moldova by Veridica, against Ukrainian refugees (the purpose being discrediting Ukraine and Ukrainians, finding arguments in favor of stereotypes designed to reinforce the idea that the good Russians are trying to fight an evil.

Konasenko specified that in the shortest time the Ministry of Defense will publish a series of documents, obtained from the Ukrainian collaborators of the biological laboratories, presenting the results of the expertise.""
NARRATIVE: In the secret biological laboratories of the USA in Ukraine, the coronavirus was produced.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FAKE: After the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that there were secret US-funded laboratories in Ukraine where biological weapons were being developed, Russian officials tried to dress up this narrative with new elements and made this reference to SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that is believed to have originated from bats.
Veridica.ro recently dismantled the basic narrative, which constitutes one of the cores of the war propaganda, according to which Russia is bombing Ukrainian cities to destroy biological weapons laboratories and save humanity. In reality, there were no laboratories in Ukraine where biological weapons were produced or developed. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons. Moscow did not present any concrete proof of the existence of such laboratories, but justified the attack on Ukrainian cities and Snake Island by the need to destroy them.
The history of this false narrative is older and since 2020 the US embassy in Kiev has reacted to it by stating that there is no American secret laboratory on the territory of Ukraine.
The propaganda message is an attempt to arouse a wave of hatred of Russians towards Ukraine and the West, which, apparently, brought to the country COVID-19, being a casus belli found post-factum by the Kremlin. Regarding the coronavirus, Moscow is reviving the conspiracy theories according to which the virus was created by the Americans to destroy humanity and only Russia again has to save it.
Veridica showed in the analyzes published last year how Moscow promoted a series of false narratives, fake news and disinformation regarding the pandemic, including a conspiracy theory according to which COVID-19 is a weapon created by the Pentagon in laboratories in former Soviet states.

We can find a compromise regarding the future of these territories,"" he said.
Zelensky emphasized that for him the most important thing is ""how the people will live on these territories, who want to become a component part of Ukraine"". The President of Ukraine specified that it is not just about a simple recognition.
[...] Crimea returned to the Russian Federation following the 2014 referendum. 96.77% of the region's residents and 95.6% of the voters in Sevastopol voted for annexation.
NARRATIVE: The President of Ukraine could recognize Donbass and Crimea as Russian territories.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the president of Ukraine has not declared that he is willing to discuss the status of the self-proclaimed republics in Donbass or Crimea's belonging to Russia. His words were taken out of context and interpreted in a way favorable to Moscow. Being asked by the ABC News journalist if Ukraine could accept Putin's conditions and recognize the occupation of Crimea and Donass, Zelenskiy asked Vladimir Putin to sit down at the negotiation table. At the same time, the president declared that Ukraine is looking for dialogue and compromise, but has no intention of capitulating. The Russian press presented this statement as a compromise already made, as a concession.
After the appearance of this propaganda message, the pro-presidential party in Ukraine ""Servant of the People"" explained to the international press that during the negotiations with Russia the subject of the territorial integrity of Ukraine will not be discussed. ""We have to decide how people's lives will be organized."" in these territories within the limits of our integral state, this was the message of President Zelenski"", according to a press release of the ruling party, which mentioned that Ukraine will include Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea after the war.
The purpose of this propaganda narrative was to show the domestic Russian public that the ""denazification operation of Ukraine"" (in reality - a military invasion) is succeeding and that Zelensky is willing to accept Moscow's demands. In fact, after 2 weeks of fighting , Russia did not achieve its tactical goals, Ukraine continuing to resist. Publication / Media:

The Russian-Ukrainian war, defied with frivolous falsehoods
dw.com / 22 Feb. 2022, reuters.com / 26 Feb. 2022, reuters.com / 2 Mar. 2022
Among the fakes associated with the war in Ukraine circulated on social networks - most hoaxes loaded with pathos and drama - there are some that we could euphemistically label as frivolous, but without humor. This is also the case with this video which, according to the descriptions, shows either Russian soldiers partying before going to the front in Ukraine, or Russian and Ukrainian soldiers dancing together as proof of a non-existent war. Deutsche Welle found the original film, made in 2018 at a concert in Uzbekistan. Using Google Maps, the journalists identified the place of the show as the metro in Tashkent. The same category includes the photo distributed on Facebook, in which a village woman appears with a uniform, protective glasses and an assault weapon, labeled as Olena Zelenska, the wife of the Ukrainian president. The Reuters agency dismantled the fake, showing that the young woman in the image is the former Miss Ukraine 2015 Anastasia Lenna, who shared her portrait with a toy gun after allegedly enlisting in the Ukrainian army. Tens of thousands of likes were collected on Twitter by a video in which a supposedly Ukrainian young woman excitedly explains how to drive a tank. However, the video is more than a year old and was created by a Russian vlogger.
The legend of mobile human crematoria reactivated
The Telegraph / 23 Feb. 2022, france24.com / 28 Feb. 2022
The information about a mobile human crematorium from an article published in the British newspaper The Telegraph on the eve of the start of the Russian invasion in Ukraine became, after a week of war, an occasion for speculation and conspiracy theories on social networks. In the article quoted by France 24 journalists, the British Secretary of Defense Ben Wallace suggested the possibility of the Russians using mobile incinerators to hide the human losses suffered or caused in the conflict, stating that such a tactic was also used in 2015, to the annexation of Ukraine. The images with the human crematorium inserted in the article, presented as being published by the British Ministry of Defense, convinced many users on social networks that the device is part of the tactical arsenal of the invaders to hide the atrocities committed in the war. In reality, a simple search on the Internet showed that the clip is an extract from a 2013 commercial presentation material of an incinerator manufacturer, unrelated to the military industry. The conclusion of the journalists from France 24 is that there is no evidence to support the theory of the use of mobile crematoria in the current Russian-Ukrainian conflict, just as there was no evidence for their alleged use in 2015.
The lie of the expulsion of Russian students in Europe
foxnews.com / 24 Feb. 2022, sciencebusiness.net / 27 Feb. 2022
The electronic publication sciencebusiness.net presents the reaction of several European universities and organizations to the misinformation launched by the Russian human rights official. Tatiana Moskalkova has repeatedly argued on her Twitter page that Russian students are unjustifiably expelled, they are not allowed access to courses and are ""morally persecuted"", which would be proof of ""racial discrimination"" practiced by universities. Without providing evidence and citing as the source alleged complaints from parents, Moskalkova stated that such cases would have happened in universities in France, the Czech Republic, Belgium and other European countries. In response, the Association of European Universities categorically denied the accusations, stating that no such situations have been reported and that in the European academic environment there is no intention to exclude Russian students as retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. The only request appeared in the United States, where California Democrat Eric Swalwell proposed that Russian students be ""kicked out"" of schools as a sanction for the invasion of Ukraine, but the idea was categorically and unanimously rejected by the American academic environment.
""Sputnik.ru"" and ""RT.ru"" propaganda blocked in the EU
consilium.europa.eu / 2 Mar. 2022, gov.ro / 28 Feb. 2022, theguardian.com / 3 Mar. 2022
Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine causes the West to resort to radical measures to reduce the effects of disinformation and pro-Kremlin propaganda. The European Union has decided to urgently suspend the broadcasting activities of the content published by Sputnik and Russia Today in the states of the union or directed towards them. Josep Borell, the high representative for foreign affairs and security qualified the activity of the two publications as a direct threat to the security and public order of the EU. The national authorities of the member states are obliged to implement the decision by restricting the broadcast of Russia Today and Sputnik content on cable networks, satellite, Internet TV, platforms, websites and online applications. Anticipating the request of the European Union, the giants of the Meta company - Facebook and Instagram - announced at the beginning of last week the blocking of the content of the targeted Russian publications on their platforms. A day later, Google took a similar measure, suspending the presence of Russia Today and Sputnik on YouTube channels. In a separate action, Alphabet, the parent company of the giant Google, announced that it had removed publications controlled by the Kremlin, including from the Google News search tool. Later, the Russia Today and Sputnik accounts were blocked in the European space and by the Twitter, TikTok and Netflix networks. In Romania, the spokesperson of the Executive made public the list of websites subject to the blocking procedure in the context of the crisis in Ukraine.
A few days after the decision of the European Union, the Canberra government in turn requested Facebook, Twitter and Google to block on Australian territory the content of the media sponsored by the Kremlin that promotes violence, extremism and misinformation regarding the military invasion of Ukraine.
War images falsified in a flurry
dw.com / Mar. 1 2022
The elimination of the main vectors of propaganda controlled by the Kremlin did not make social networks less permeable to the spread of disinformation related to the war in Ukraine. With each new day of the invasion, Deutsche Welle analysts noted an increase in the number of fake or misleading videos or photos that went viral on Facebook, Twitter or TikTok. The German channel made a selection of old images, taken out of context and presented as current. For example, the analysis of a clip with a huge explosion that would have shaken Ukraine on the eve of the invasion highlighted the surprisingly green vegetation for the month of February. The original version of the clip, identified on the Internet, revealed that the images capture the explosion of a gas station in Novosibirsk last summer. Similarly, a formation of five fighter jets, filmed while flying over an urban area, has nothing to do with the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Using the reverse search method, it was discovered that in reality it is an air show from May 2020 held in the north of Moscow. Another video described as showing an attack by Russian bombers in Ukraine is actually a fragment of an animated computer game called ""Arma-3"" - the same one that misled the journalists of the Romanian news station Antena 3. Also from an electronic game - ""Digital Combat Simulator"" - these images were also extracted, viralized on Twitter as one of the feats of arms of the Ukrainian Mig-29 pilot nicknamed the ""Ghost from Kiev"", whose Security of Ukraine credits him with shooting down ten Russian planes since the beginning of the war.In addition, the image of pilot Vladimir Abdonov - considered a hero by Ukrainians - has become the subject of fakes on social networks.
German journalists have discovered photos processed in PhotoShop in which the so-called ""Ghost of Kiev"" has the face of a Canadian pilot. In another fake image, the character who has become legendary appears with the face of an Argentine lawyer, digitally transposed on the photo of a fallen Ukrainian soldier in the first days of Russia's aggression. Journalists from Bild also fell into the trap of fake images, who presented on the German tabloid's television channel spectacular images of a paratrooper landing, allegedly Russian, hovering over Ukraine. The reverse search of the images proved that the original filming was made in Russia in 2016. The selection of fakes reported by Deutsche Welle ends with the announcement of the first American victim in the Russian-Ukrainian war in the person of Bernie Gores - an alleged CNN journalist who was allegedly killed by the explosion of a mine planted by separatists. The ""CNN Ukraine"" account on which the post was made is a fictitious one, as is also the ""CNN Afghanistan"" account which announces, in August 2021, the killing of the same fake journalist by the Taliban. In reality, the American Bernie Gores - who has nothing to do with journalism - is in good health and continues to promote himself at the YouTube shelter.
Facebook and Twitter, restricted in Russia
washingtonpost.com / Mar 4 2022
Moscow's reply to the Western sanctions applied to the main promoters of the Kremlin's propaganda was not delayed. On March 4, the Russian Internet regulatory authority announced the blocking of the Facebook network, thus joining Russia with the most oppressive regimes in the world in terms of online censorship. In a press release bordering on the absurd, Roskomnadzor accused the social network of violating the right to information and freedom of expression of Russian citizens through the restrictions imposed along with other platforms on the publications Russia Today and Sputnik. A columnist from the Washington Post sees Russia's move as a long shot, given that Facebook and Twitter do not have a dominant position on the market of Russian users, unlike other countries. The analyst appreciates that the restriction is rather a symbolic act, provocative and at the same time intimidating to the West, given the global prominence of Facebook. On the other hand, on the same day that it blocked the Facebook platform, Moscow issued a law with potentially more dangerous consequences in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. It is about the criminalization of spreading news or information officially considered to be ""false"", a crime punishable by 15 years in prison. The new regulation was followed by the suspension of the activity in Russia of numerous foreign press companies, as well as the closure several local publications.

The narrative was launched in order to justify Russia's military actions against Ukraine.
NEWS: ""The Russian military came into possession of the documents of the National Guard of Ukraine, which confirm the fact that Kiev was preparing an offensive operation in Donbass in March, announced the official representative of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, Major General Igor Konasenkov. [...]
The issue of US and NATO involvement in the planning of this operation from Ukraine regarding an invasion in Donbass is still being analyzed, said Konasenkov. However, it is known that the American and British instructors put NATO standards into the minds of the Ukrainian soldiers in some combat units. [...]
According to Moscow's data, the Ukrainians planned to complete the preparation for the offensive in Donbass on February 28, but the Russian special operation blocked these plans.""
NARRATIVE: Kiev was preparing an aggression against the Donbass in March, that's why Russia had to intervene in Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The documents published on the RIA Novosti Telegram channel, but also on the web pages of the pro-Kremlin media, do not describe the preparation of an offensive on the Donbass controlled by pro-Russian separatists, but present the process of military reorganization in the area of ​​the Operation United Forces. The order of presentation of the photographed pages from the so-called secret documents seems to be dubious: the description of the operation of the united forces, which has been taking place in Donbass since 2014, is presented in the context of other documents that are out of context and whose authenticity can be questioned. The final decision, cited by RIA Novosti, is not even signed by the Ukrainian general Mykola Balan, it is not clear whether the document is a draft decision or a fake act. On the last page of the document we find grammatical mistakes, linguistic inconsistencies or alignments that have nothing to do with the logic of an act that would indicate preparation for an offensive operation.
Several times Ukrainian officials denied the information in the Russian media about Ukraine's preparations for an offensive against the Donbass. The Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, stated that Ukraine never set out to attack, to launch a war against the Donbass or Crimea because it cares a lot about the lives of civilians, unlike Russia which attacked civilian targets : kindergartens, schools, etc.
Russia has long launched narratives regarding alleged aggressive intentions of Kiev; see for example the one according to which Ukraine is preparing to massacre the civilians in Donbass, dismantled by Veridica. And the foreign minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, justified the invasion as a preventive measure for the outbreak of a possible war right on the territory of Ukraine, a statement that is part of Russia's metanarratives regarding the situation in Ukraine.
In addition, Ukrainian military analysts have always been aware of the disproportion of forces between Ukraine and Russia, which in the world also has nuclear weapons. Kiev knew that an attack against the Donbass would have immediately generated a military response from Russia, something confirmed by the fact that the safety of the separatist republics was invoked by Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine.

NARRATIVE: Russia is bombing Ukrainian cities to destroy biological weapons laboratories and save humanity.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: There were no biological weapons production laboratories in Ukraine, financed by Western states. In 2007, Ukraine joined the Convention on the Non-Proliferation of Biological Weapons. In spite of this fact, in recent years the Russian press has drawn the attention of the public opinion in the post-Soviet states to some American-Ukrainian projects in the field of biological research. The agreement between Ukraine and the USA in this field is presented by the Russian media as an element of the production of biological weapons. In reality, such collaboration agreements also exist in the case of other post-Soviet states, and until 2012 the USA also cooperated with Russia in this field. Moscow does not present any concrete evidence that there was any laboratory for the production of biological weapons in Ukraine, but it justifies the attack on Ukrainian cities and the Snake Island by the need to destroy them.
In fact, in the first days of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Moscow attacked airports, military centers and critical infrastructure, not ""basement laboratories"". International press reporters present in Ukraine reported daily on bombings and attacks against civilian infrastructure. They were destroyed schools, kindergartens, killed women and children.
The purpose of this propaganda narrative is to present Russia as a savior of humanity and to justify aggressive actions in Ukraine as a necessary measure to destroy the biological weapons production laboratories, which are an invention of Russian propaganda. Publication / Media:

In this key, the Russian press describes the attacks against Kharkiv, the capture of the civil nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia and the occupation of the decommissioned power plant in Chernobyl, where in 1986 the biggest nuclear accident in history took place.
NEWS: ""In recent years, Kiev has shown an active interest in the exploitation and enrichment of uranium, requesting help from foreign companies,"" a representative of the competent Russian department told RIA Novosti. According to him, Ukraine has intensified the exploration of deep layers on the territory of uranium mines. Also, the development of uranium deposits that are located in the Nikolaev, Dnepropetrovsk and Kirovograd regions was started. In addition, the authorities used the area of ​​the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to carry out plutonium separation work and the creation of a ""dirty"" bomb, the source said.
[...]
In addition, there are reasons to believe that the United States at some point transferred plutonium to Kiev, which was used to create a nuclear charge. Kiev is in the closest stage to creating a plutonium-based nuclear charge. This would have ended in just a few months. The main role in the process of creating a nuclear explosive device belonged to the Institute of Physics and Technology in Kharkiv.
As the interlocutor of the publication noted, the active confrontations at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant are taking place because documents regarding the activity of creating nuclear weapons by Kiev were kept there"".
NARRATIVE: Ukraine wants to obtain nuclear weapons, which represents an existential danger for Russia, which had to intervene militarily.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: Currently, Ukraine does not have nuclear weapons and there is no evidence that it has tried to produce such weapons. The propaganda narrative about plutonium or uranium enrichment preparations, but also about classified documents from Chernobyl, Kharkiv or Zaporozhye, are just a pretext to justify an invasion of Ukraine. Moreover, public opinion in Russia was prepared in advance for such narratives. In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Russia cannot fail to react to the nuclear threat from Ukraine.
The Chernobyl plant is decommissioned and was occupied by the Russian military who invaded from Belarus in the direction of Kiev. The heavy equipment brought by the Russians raised the dust in the area, which led to an increase in the level of radiation.
The Russian army also captured, after some battles, the power station in Zaporozhye, where a fire broke out during the clashes, which led to the denunciation of Russia's actions at the international level. Later, contrary to the safety rules in the field, the Russians imposed the command of the army at the plant.
In order to give the information more credibility in the eyes of the Russians, fueled by fears about the ""American imperialists"", the ""support"" of the USA is also mentioned. In reality, Ukraine purchases nuclear fuel from Westinghouse (USA) to supplement its own reserves necessary for the stable operation of nuclear power plants.
Ukraine possessed nuclear weapons, inherited from the USSR, which it gave up in exchange for the commitment of the USA, Great Britain and Russia that its sovereignty and territorial integrity will not be violated. Russia is the one that violated this commitment since 2014, when it invaded and occupied the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and supported, with equipment and people, the insurrection in Donbass. Moscow violated this commitment again in 2022. Publication / Media:

The analysis article tries to justify a possible repetition of the situation in Ukraine and in the Republic of Moldova, if it maintains its current approach towards Russia and the West.
NEWS: ""The EU member states have decided to send planes, missiles and other military equipment to Ukraine. We will not exaggerate if we say that, in fact, the West has declared war on Russia.
[...]
The entire policy of the Chisinau authorities is fully coordinated with Washington and the European Union. We remind you that the EU Foreign Ministers have agreed to ban the transmission of RT and Sputnik stations on EU territory.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The West provoked Russia to attack Ukraine. 2. Russia is currently facing the entire West, which supports Ukraine. 3. The Republic of Moldova risks suffering serious consequences because it aligned itself with the West.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The international community condemned the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the world's most important economies (with the exception of China), as well as most European states, imposed unprecedented sanctions. Several states have also promised military aid, in the form of ammunition and equipment, and the EU has announced that it will grant half a billion euros for Ukraine's military needs. But both NATO and other countries announced that they would not intervene in the war, even if they strongly condemned the Russian invasion.
The Republic of Moldova also criticized the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, but did not join the economic sanctions. The only involvement of the Chisinau authorities concerns the organization of shelter and food for Ukrainian refugees.
OBJECTIVE: To justify the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. To inoculate the idea that the Russian Federation is fighting the entire West that is trying to limit its security space. To present the pro-European government in Chisinau as an ally of the West and, respectively, hostile to the Russian Federation. To undermine the efforts of the Republic of Moldova to approach the West by scaring the population and politicians with the prospect of an invasion similar to that of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The thesis that Russia was provoked to start this war and that the fight is not against Ukraine, but against the entire West, is one of the basis of Kremlin propaganda.
No country in the world has announced that it will get involved in the war in Ukraine. European and NATO member states have announced that they support Ukraine, including with military equipment, but no more, despite Kiev's requests to be supported more substantially by Russian aggression.
At the last meeting of NATO's foreign ministers, held on March 4, the Alliance reiterated that it was not involved in the war and refused Kiev's request to impose an air exclusion zone over Ukraine.
It is true that on February 28, the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, declared in a press conference that military aircraft could be delivered to Ukraine, but, later, the member states denied this possibility, the statement of the European official being qualified as a ""diplomatic blunder"".
Even if it condemned the military invasion of Russia in Ukraine, Chisinau did not join the Western sanctions, reasoning that they would be ineffective and, in addition, their adoption would be dangerous for the Republic of Moldova.
Theoretically, it is possible for Russia to launch a campaign in the Republic of Moldova, given that it has troops on the territory of this country, just like in Ukraine, it supports a separatist territory, just as in Ukraine and Moldova was part of the USSR, being seen by the Kremlin , like other ex-Soviet countries, as part of its sphere of influence. On the other hand, Moldova is a neutral state, and the stake of its control is lower than that of Ukraine. In addition, at the moment Russia is occupied with Ukraine, and as far as Moldova is concerned, it has not issued threats or made preparations for war. At the same time, Moscow has enough leverage to influence Moldova. Finally, it should also be noted that, when Moldova signed the Association Agreement with the EU, at the summit in Vilnius in 2013, it was not subjected to the same pressure from Russia as Ukraine, which then refused to sign.

In reality, it is Russia that is bombing Ukrainian cities and has destroyed numerous civilian targets, including apartment blocks, schools, etc.
NARRATIVE: Ukrainian nationalists opened fire on the peaceful civilians of Volnovaha, who were leaving the city with white flags. ""The Russian Ministry of Defense emphasizes that it does not attack civilian targets on the territory of Ukraine - only military infrastructure, civilians are safe.""
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the first part of the report of the national press agency RIA NOVOSTI from Russia contradicts the second. If the Russian Ministry of Defense gives assurances that it only hits military infrastructure objects, why would the Ukrainians have to leave the city? Another logical question is why, ""being attacked by Ukrainian nationalists"", according to the narrative of the pro-Kremlin media, civilians leave the city of Volnovaha in the direction of the territories controlled by Kiev and not in the direction of the self-proclaimed ""liberating"" republics?
The head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration, Pavlo Kirilenko, wrote on his Facebook account that the city of Volnovaha is practically destroyed by the Russians. Kiev sent a convoy to evacuate the civilians from Volnovaha, but it was attacked with ""Grad"" rocket launchers. The Ukrainian side claims that Russia is the one that attacked the civilians and did not allow them to leave the city.
The Ukrainian deputies from the Donetsk region say that the buses with civilians cannot leave the city of Volnovaha because the Russians open fire on the civilians and do not allow the citizens to evacuate.
In this context, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of genocide, announcing that Ukraine will file a complaint against Russia at the UN International Court of Justice in The Hague. The Ukrainian president accused the Kremlin of terror and claims that the Russian troops targeted civilians, including children.
Veridica.ro previously wrote that the Ukrainian side is the one that addressed the issue of humanitarian corridors during the second round of negotiations in Belarus. The Kyiv delegation spoke about the draft agreement for the organization of ""humanitarian aid"" in order to evacuate civilians from the combat zones. The two sides also agreed on the delivery of food and medicine to the sectors where the heaviest fighting is taking place. The Ukrainian authorities expressed their hope that these colors will really exist and will not be turned into ""traps"" for killing civilians and destabilizing the situation in the area. Moscow announced that it would allow the formation of such corridors for the besieged cities of Mariupol and Volnovaha, but the agreement regarding the formation of the corridors was violated shortly after it came into force, says the mayor of Mariupol.

In reality, the humanitarian corridors are blocked by the Russian military who open fire on the critical infrastructure.
NARRATIVE: The ""Azov"" and ""Pravyi sektor"" (banned in Russia) battalions do not allow civilians to enter the humanitarian corridor and no resident has managed to leave the city, said the deputy head of the People's Militia of the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) Eduard Basurin live on ""Russia-24"". ""The humanitarian corridor that we opened for civilians is blocked by ""Azov"" and those from the right sector [...] There are over 60 people, half of which women and children"", he said. Basurin emphasized that no resident managed to use the humanitarian corridor, the school being mined by the Ukrainians.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The Russian press lies when it reports on the separatist leaders' ""care"" for the cities of Donbass. In fact, Moscow's military invasion was argued from the very beginning by the need to free Ukrainians from Nazis and extremists. The ""Azov"" and ""Pravyi sektor"" battalions, which participate in the defense of the city of Mariupol, have been the target of media attacks during the last 8 years. These 2 paramilitary formations participate in the defense of the cities of Donbass together with the Ukrainian defense forces. from now on, the names of these battalions are mentioned to justify the presence of the Russian military on the territory of Ukraine.
In reality, the Russian military are the ones who pushed Mariupol to the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe. The Russian army opened fire on civil infrastructure, schools, kindergartens, hospitals, etc. On March 2, Russian soldiers destroyed a maternity hospital in Mariupol. A large part of the city was left without electricity due to Russia's actions. According to the press releases of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the mayor's office of the city of Mariupol, the Russian soldiers are the ones blocking the entry of food products into the city, turning the town into a besieged fortress.
Moreover, it is the Ukrainian side that addressed the issue of humanitarian corridors during the second round of negotiations in Belarus.

The false narratives are promoted by the controversial journalist Ion Cristoiu, who also says that the same ""techniques"" were used to terrorize the population during the pandemic.
NEWS: ""I was referring, invoking the role of the media in the end of the Pandemic, to the atmosphere of fear created not only in Romania, but also in the whole of Europe, by what we could call the coverage of the Pandemic in the mass media. I do not say - as the authors of conspiracy theories do - that the virus did not exist and that everything was a media manipulation. I say, as I said then, that the atmosphere of panic was exaggerated by the dramatization to which the media subjected a true reality [...] For a while the media only dealt with those who fell ill and died from the Coronavirus, the Pandemic seemed to be the only disease existing on the planet and the only cause of death. Another instrument represented what we could call the glass half full. If you exclusively present only deaths from the Coronavirus, the Pandemic extinguishes fear. If you also present healings, the Pandemic is no longer so dangerous [...] The apocalyptic chocolates have run out of bread. Those who maintained our fear through apocalyptic prophecies - from Raed Arafat to Virgil Musta - have disappeared from the ranks of media stars. Some returned to the anonymity from where they came.
Others, such as Raed Arafat, Gabriel Diaconu - reprofiled themselves. There are no more Pandemic Apocalyptic Skulls. They are the Apocalyptic Bones of War [...] Fear in the name of which the national wealth was looted, a new category of the rich has emerged: the Pandemic Rich. Yes, it's gone. Another Fear took its place: the Fear of War and, more recently, of Nuclear War.
The fear in the name of which the news televisions, the same ones who violated deontology, on the grounds that such a thing is allowed in the War with the enemy called Pandemic, practices a delirium of fake news, on the grounds that such a thing is allowed in the War with the enemy called Vladimir Putin .
The fear in the name of which websites, televisions are closed and the exclusion of certain personalities from public life is demanded only and only, because they ask themselves questions, because they want to understand what is happening [...] The fear in the name of which no we still have to ask ourselves how to explain the waste of money given to the EU by every European citizen on vaccine doses that are now thrown down the drain.
Like the Fear of the Coronavirus, the Fear of War is about to create a new category of rich people. The rich people from the arms purchase commission"". NARRATIVES: 1. The war in Ukraine is used in the same way as the pandemic, to frighten the population, just as the coronavirus pandemic was used. 2. The risks generated by the war in Ukraine are exaggerated by the media. 3. Russia is denigrated by fake news presented by the mass media covering the war in Ukraine. 4. The war in Ukraine is a pretext for the Russian press to be censored, and those who ask questions or have other points of view to be forced to remain silent. 5. War is used by arms sellers to get rich.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Ion Cristoiu's article comes against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the order of the Kremlin leader, Vladimir Putin, under the pretext that Russia's security would be threatened in the event of Ukraine's virtual accession to the EU and NATO. Even if this would have been rather, in practice, a matter of years.
Moreover, after the power from the Kremlin did not succeed in a ""blitzkrieg"" as expected in Ukraine, rather this will be a longer-term one and difficult for Russia to sustain financially, Moscow also received a series of heavy economic sanctions from the West.
All these facts inevitably led to threats from Russia, which on Sunday, on the fourth day of the war it is waging in Ukraine, when Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear forces on alert.
Incidentally, the vice-president of the Russian Security Council, Dmitri Medvedev, threatened the West again on Monday, amid the sanctions: ""Don't forget that economic wars have often turned into real wars"".
As far as Ion Cristoiu is concerned, he is by no means at his first conspiracy article regarding the coronavirus pandemic and the demonization of the West for an alleged aggression against Russia.
The fact that the pandemic was not a human catastrophe is one of the main narratives of Russian propaganda, frequently reported by Veridica.ro.
The official figures of the World Health Organization (WHO) show that no less than 5.96 million people around the world have died so far from infection with COVID-19, and Russia was one of the most affected with 345,000 of officially reported deaths out of 16.2 million cases.
OBJECTIVE: Distracting attention from the war that Russia is waging and especially premeditated with Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: The author does not mention anything about the fact that Russia is the aggressor state that initiated the military action against Ukraine, without having a real reason under the alleged security threat to Russia. Vladimir Putin has also made it clear that he is ready to use his nuclear weapons, threatening ""unprecedented consequences"" to anyone who interferes in the conflict, organizing exercises of nuclear forces before the start of the war and placing them on alert after it has started, so Russia is the one inducing fear. Other risks that the press has written about are the triggering of a refugee crisis - as their number is fast approaching one million and the UN has estimated that it could reach 5 million, again, it is no exaggeration - and that of an economic crisis which, considering that the sanctions against Russia indirectly affect Western countries, is not exaggerated; on the contrary, as in the case of the refugee crisis, the first signs are already visible his signs.
Although he does not name them in his article, Cristoiu refers to the closure of media critical to this pandemic such as Sputnik or Russia, Russia's main propaganda vehicles. In fact, these were fake news factories that supported, on the pandemic side, conservative and ultra-religious groups, as well as anti-vaxxers. Even so, they were not closed because of disinformation intended to undermine anti-pandemic measures, but after the start of the war in Ukraine, when they took over the Kremlin's official propaganda against the war and narratives that do not correspond to reality at all.
Ion Cristoiu does not in any way prove the fact that fake news was broadcast in the Romanian and European mass media regarding the war in Ukraine. Even if sometimes they had a tendency to exaggerate or take some information that was not confirmed, publications and televisions in Romania generally had a correct line and faithfully reflected the essence of this situation - namely that Russia invaded a state on a large scale independently invoking false pretexts, with clearly superior forces, that he failed to conquer significant urban centers even though he besieged several, that he suffered important losses in the field and that Ukrainian civilians were killed in his bombings. However, none of these realities are reflected by the Russian mass media (with a few rare exceptions) which take up the official theses according to which it is only a limited special operation and that, in fact, the separatist forces in Donbass are the ones who are engaged in conflict.
For years, Sputnik and Russia Today promoted fake news about ""neo-Nazis and drug addicts"" who hold power in Kiev, a ubiquitous fact in Putin's speeches justifying the attack on Ukraine. Paradoxically, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, is ethnically Jewish, moreover, he is also Russian-speaking, and his family went through the Holocaust during the Nazis.
As far as the enrichment of arms sellers is concerned, Russia was not forced by anyone to invade, so to suggest that the war was provoked in the interests of Western arms companies is akin to saying that Vladimir Putin is their sales agent. Publication / Media:

The false narrative is promoted by politnavigator.net, which refers to the comment of a Russian expert.
NEWS: ""NATO member states could deliver additional weapons to the Kiev regime through the Marculesti airport in the Republic of Moldova, writes the political scientist from Kaliningrad, Alexandr Nosovici, on his Telegram channel. According to him, an agreement regarding the use of the airport was agreed upon during the discussions between the President of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, and the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.
[...]
After the start of the special operation in Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova closed its airspace, but the flight radars received several planes flying from Romania. There were rumors that these were NATO planes, which were carrying weapons for Ukraine. The Moldovan government denied this information.""
NARRATIVES: 1. NATO secretly delivers weapons to Ukraine. 2. The pro-European government in Chisinau violates the country's neutrality status by offering its NATO infrastructure to deliver weapons to Ukraine. 3. The Republic of Moldova allied itself with Russia's enemies.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is a neutral state by the Constitution, and the current government has repeatedly announced that the subject of joining NATO is not under discussion. Chisinau has announced that it is not and will not be involved in the war caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moldova has its own security risks, with a separatist region and a frozen conflict (Transnistria) and a pro-Russian autonomous region (Gagauzia). In addition, Russia - which intervened, on the side of the separatists, in the war in Transnistria in 1992 - has troops on the territory of the Republic of Moldova and granted Russian citizens to the majority of the population of the separatist region, so that Chisinau has enough reasons not to provoke Moscow.
However, especially in recent months, Russian propaganda, fueled by the statements of some pro-Moscow politicians from Chisinau, insists more and more on so-called hidden agreements, or the intention of the Chisinau government to join NATO. Propaganda also relies on the fact that a small number of Moldovan citizens (20-25%) would vote for joining this military bloc, trying to incite the spirits, especially of the national minorities, against the authorities.
But this does not take into account the fact that the Republic of Moldova, considered one (if not the poorest) of the poorest countries in Europe, with a tiny defense budget, which is also facing a separatist conflict, having on its territory a Russian military contingent, is too unattractive as a candidate for accession, even if the authorities would request this.
OBJECTIVE: To accredit the idea that the government in Chisinau violates the country's neutrality status, despite the citizens' preferences, and to present it as a potential danger for the Russian Federation, justifying an eventual intervention similar to the one in Ukraine. To inoculate the idea that NATO is secretly providing weapons to Ukraine. To confirm Vladimir Putin's statements that Russia is the victim of a Western/NATO conspiracy. The article was also published on a forum, where it gathered dozens of comments, mostly vulgar, insulting and threatening towards the Republic of Moldova and other states that will help Ukraine, and quotes from the Russian president were also published.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: NATO announced that it cannot intervene in the war between Russia and Ukraine because its statute does not allow it to get involved in a conflict if a member state of the Alliance has not been attacked.
However, several member states have officially announced that they will send weapons to Ukraine in the war with Russia, which is the aggressor state. In this context, the Alliance has no reason to camouflage its support, hiding it in a small and obscure former military airport, with outdated infrastructure, almost unguarded, located approximately 80 km from the pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria, which hosts Russian armed forces and military munitions.
In addition, Ukraine is directly adjacent to four NATO member states - Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland - with a length of the common border of over 800 km, so that the use of Marculesti airport for the storage of weapons by NATO would be meaningless. .
Maia Sandu did indeed have a telephone discussion with the American secretary, in the context of the war in Ukraine, just as she also discussed with other international officials. The Republic of Moldova is one of the main destinations, at least for transit, for Ukrainian refugees. Only until February 27, the Chisinau authorities registered more than 70,000 people, so they need help to manage such a large flow of people, which represents more than 2% of its population.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Chisinau authorities denied, through a Telegram channel specially created for this purpose, the information about the landing of some NATO planes, or any other aircraft in Marculesti in the last days. ""Regarding the misinformation circulating in the public space about NATO aircraft that would have landed at the airport in Marculesti, we communicate the following: It is a fake. The airspace of the Republic of Moldova is closed. ""In the last 3 days, not a single aircraft has landed at Marculesti,"" the message says. Politnavigator mentions at the end of the article that the Chisinau Government denied the information, but did not remove the material from the website. Publication / Media:

Which was to be expected. Donetsk and Luhansk were recognized by the Parliament of the Russian Federation as independent states [...] Are we dealing with two new states appearing on the world map or with a transition towards unification with ""mother Russia""? [... ] Extremely interesting first reaction of the United States and NATO states. A senior official of the White House left the entire planet speechless, declaring bluntly that these cardinal decisions regarding Donetsk and Luhansk do not represent an act of aggression by Moscow, nor the sending of troops there to keep the peace, as the separation of the two provinces has been going on for a long time and was done by popular referendum and not as a result of a Russian invasion.Furthermore, the recent decisions taken by the parliamentarians of Donetsk and Luhansk and approved as such by the Parliament of the Russian Federation they are not acts of aggression, but democratic acts. Therefore, the conditions are not met for the NATO states, together or separately, to define what happened as an act of aggression against Ukraine and, consequently, to adopt the punitive measures announced for such an act eventuality. Short for two. At the same time, one by one, NATO states announce that they will not recognize the statehood of the two regions. Let's see if there won't be exceptions. Is the situation of the province of Kosovo being repeated in reverse, transformed into a state after the end of the war against Yugoslavia and its disintegration? For a long time, Kosovo, created under American and Western pressure, was not recognized by some of the then member states of the European Union or later members, such as Romania. Even now, the statehood of Kosovo is not recognized by Spain, an EU and NATO state. It is interesting to see what will happen from this perspective in the future with Donetsk and Luhansk [...] If it is not aggression, it is not war. If there is no war, the foreseen sanctions cannot be applied. If there is no war and there will be no sanctions, then all the alarm signals raised by NATO officials and heads of member states turn out to have been simple acts of propaganda"", writes Sorin Rosca Stanescu on corectnews.com. NARRATIVES: 1. Russia did not invade Ukraine, because Donetsk and Luhansk already belonged to it de facto 2. The United States does not consider sending Russian troops to Donbass to be an invasion. 3. The West supported the creation of the state of Kosovo, so Russia also has the right to support the creation of new states in eastern Ukraine.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the evening of February 21, the Kremlin leader, Vladimir Putin, recognized the separatist republics in eastern Ukraine - Luhansk and Donetsk - which the Russian rebels, supported by the Russian military, had been controlling since 2014, after the Euromaindan from Kiev. Then the Ukrainians overthrew the pro-Russian regime of Viktor Yanukovych, and the country turned to the European Union as a model of economic development.
Moscow has tried unsuccessfully in recent months to negotiate new spheres of influence with the West and to block a hypothetical accession of Ukraine to NATO under the pretext of security threats to it. On the other hand, the West replied to the Kremlin that it is up to the sovereign decision of each state whether or not to join the structures of the North Atlantic Alliance. The West did not comply with Moscow's demands, which also demanded a withdrawal of NATO troops from the Alliance's member states from the eastern flank to the pre-1997 positions.
Against this otherwise predictable background, the Kremlin created a series of diversions along the border with the help of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk and sent ""peacekeeping troops"" to these regions of eastern Ukraine. Western officials have every reason to believe that Putin could go even further, across the demarcation line of the front, currently drawn by the Minsk Agreements, to invade larger parts of Ukraine, especially since the Kremlin leader declared that he recognized the separatist republics with all the territories claimed by them, which are currently under the control of the Kiev government.
OBJECTIVE: To mislead public opinion that the US - and, by extension, the West - agrees with Russia's military maneuvers in Donetsk and Luhansk and will not take action or impose sanctions on Moscow.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The author Sorin Rosca Stanescu, otherwise a constant and open promoter in his editorials of the classic narratives of Russian propaganda, a fact demonstrated repeatedly by Veridica.ro, uses a series of sophisms and reinterprets the positions of the White House towards Russia's actions in Donetsk and Luhansk. Rosca Stanescu juggles the terms used by American officials to create the impression of an alleged resignation of the US in the face of Russian maneuvers related to eastern Ukraine.
First of all, Rosca Stanescu states that an American official ""blatantly said"" that ""these cardinal decisions regarding Donetsk and Luhansk do not represent an act of aggression by Moscow"". However, there was no statement in this sense, but, as France 24 notes, ""a high-ranking American official refused to specify whether Putin's order for the Russian armed forces to take care of ""peacekeeping"" there [in Donetsk and Luhansk] is considered an invasion, thus triggering much broader and more severe Western sanctions against Moscow"". It is therefore a completely different shade than the one supported by Rosca Stanescu.
""We will evaluate what Russia has done,"" the official told reporters, stressing that Russian forces have already been secretly deployed in the separatist areas for eight years. ""Russian troops moving into Donbass would not be a new step,"" he said. he said. ""We will continue to pursue diplomacy until the tanks move,"" said the US official, quoted by the mentioned source.
In other words, the US says that the Russian presence in Donetsk and Luhansk was already an act known to the West and that it is now waiting to see if the Russians and the separatists will cross the demarcation line further to apply tougher sanctions or make other decisions regarding to such a possible scenario.
On the other hand, Russia has been rolling out for years the ""classic"" thesis of the ""previous Kosovo"", by which Moscow tries to say that if the West intervened for the creation of Kosovo in the Balkans following a referendum, it is Russia's right to carry out similar actions in areas inhabited mostly by ethnic groups or even Russian citizens following a mass offering of passports.
Russia is trying to accredit the idea of ​​a justified intervention in Donetsk and Luhansk (and, previously, in Crimea), just as NATO intervened against Serbia during the war in the Balkans at the end of the 90s. However, the military justification for the NATO intervention was linked to stopping the war crimes committed by the Serbian army and paramilitary forces. Comparatively, today, Ukraine has not even violated the demarcation line drawn in the east of the country against the pro-Russian separatists.
In fact, Russia manufactured a gross fake that would have involved armored vehicles and soldiers of Ukraine that would have forced the demarcation line. Ukrainian diplomacy denied the incident.

NEWS: ""The Ukrainian side is in charge of distributing staged video materials about Donbass, according to which civil infrastructure was destroyed by the people's republics [...] To justify its criminal actions, the Ukrainian side publishes false information and staged the destruction of of the civil infrastructure, the faces, by the People's Militia"", writes Regnum, presenting the photo / video evidence of Kiev regarding the attacks of the separatist forces on the Ukrainian towns as fake news or rigged materials.
""They shot the kindergarten alone. A provocation from the Ukrainian armed forces"", people write in the comments. There are assumptions about staging this attack: ""It is a fake prepared in advance. Look at the whole bottles in the photos and the balls arranged on the shelves. In such cases should not be like that"", Moskovski Komsomolet notes.
NARRATIVE: Kiev staged Donbass separatist attacks on civilian infrastructure to justify its crimes against Russian speakers
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the context of the escalation of the situation in Donbass and the encirclement of the territory of Ukraine by the military forces of the Russian Federation, the separatist forces have intensified their firing in the direction of the territory controlled by the government in Kiev.
OSCE observers have noted a spectacular increase in cases of violations of the ceasefire agreement in eastern Ukraine, where Kiev's troops are facing pro-Russian separatists. Hundreds of explosions were recorded on both sides of the front.
Most of the time, the separatists' attacks on the civil infrastructure in the territory controlled by the Kiev government were presented in the pro-Kremlin press as some inventions of Ukraine, used as an opportunity to open fire on the territory of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Moreover, the Russian-backed separatist authorities in eastern Ukraine also declared that a car was blown up near their administration building in the center of the city of Donetsk. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, as well as Ukrainian officials, emphasized that the intensification of ongoing clashes in eastern Ukraine represents ""a provocation scenario"" designed by Russia to justify an attack on Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to convince the public opinion in Russia and the former Soviet states that the Ukrainian military are the only aggressors in Donbass, and the separatist forces are only defending themselves.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In reality, the kindergarten in the town of Stanita Luganska and other civil infrastructure targets came under the artillery fire of the separatists from Donbass, a fact documented by the international press, but also by Bellingcat or InformNapalm experts. According to independent specialists, it is an attack from the territory controlled by separatists and mercenaries supported by Moscow. In a report of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it is said that at the time of the attack there were children and educators in the kindergarten. Two of the teachers were wounded in the head. Numerous foreign television stations have documented this case and broadcast reports that dismantle the fake news released by the pro-Kremlin press.
It is worth mentioning that the Russian press quoted a lot of real or fake users of social networks, who, apparently, saw how the Ukrainian army fired at their own kindergartens and schools. The names of the witnesses, photographs or other evidence that would illustrate this narrative of Moscow are not presented.
In fact, the pro-Kremlin media and the spokespersons of the People's Militia in the self-proclaimed republics were forced to launch this fake news - ultimately quite unconvincing - because the destruction of civilian objects in eastern Ukraine by the separatist forces contradicts the messages of recent ""classic"" disinformation. Veridica.ro dismantled a series of fake news about Ukraine's intention to massacre civilians in Donbass and Russia's initiative to save Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.

The goal of the Alliance is to push Moldova towards a war with Russia. False narratives are promoted despite the fact that there is no question of Moldova joining NATO.
NEWS: ""In the context of the hysteria surrounding the fictitious Russian ""invasion"" in Ukraine and the rapid degradation of this state's economy, the Republic of Moldova and its medium-term prospects deserve special attention. From now on, the USA and other NATO member states are starting to deliver Western weapons models to the republic, and Chisinau officially signs partnership agreements and mutual commitments with the military structures in the West. Doesn't this situation remind you of anything?
[...]
We have Maia Sandu who participates in anti-Russian projects and publicly declares that it is necessary to evacuate the contingent of Russian peacekeepers from Transnistria.
[...]
They all talk about the fact that Washington is preparing Moldova for the Ukrainian scenario. But do the Moldovans need this? Instead of the status of NATO and EU members, the Ukrainians received a stagnant economy, a low standard of living, the evacuation of capital and unclear prospects for the future"".
NARRATIVES: 1. The approach to the West is harmful for states like Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. 2. The Republic of Moldova risks ending up in a situation similar to that of Ukraine if it continues its approach to the West. 3. NATO and the West are preparing the involvement of the Republic of Moldova in a military conflict with Russia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Republic of Moldova is an ex-Soviet state, which is facing a frozen conflict, caused by a separatist enclave supported by Moscow. Citizens are divided according to geopolitical criteria - almost half of the population wants the foreign policy to be oriented towards Russia and even the accession to the Eurasian Union, controlled by Moscow, while the other part of society, especially the young and the intelligentsia, opts for the accession to the EU, including through the union with Romania.
The eastern vector is especially supported by the ethnic minorities, who speak the Russian language, and by the elderly, nostalgic for the former USSR and dissatisfied with the bad social conditions, which especially affect this category.
The last elections (the presidential elections of 2020 and the anticipated parliamentary elections of 2021) brought clear victories to the pro-European right, and the propaganda and manipulation (promoted by the Russian press and that of the Republic of Moldova affiliated to the left-wing, pro-Moscow opposition) related to the dangers of rapprochement with the West , the risk of the Republic of Moldova joining NATO and being involved in a conflict with Russia have increased. The pro-European government is presented as being completely controlled by the West, Russophobic and indifferent to the interests of its own citizens.
OBJECTIVE: To induce fear about the danger of involving the Republic of Moldova in a large-scale military conflict (against Russia) if it continues to approach the West.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The government in Chisinau did not sign any kind of agreements with the ""military structures of the West"" - i.e. NATO. The executive only approved an action plan with NATO for the years 2022-2023, which actually represents the extension a document signed and in force since 2006. The action plan does not foresee additional commitments, nor the possibility of the Republic of Moldova joining NATO, which is a neutral state by the Constitution.
Another false narrative, heavily promoted by the Russian media, is that the authorities in Chisinau, including President Maia Sandu, would demand the evacuation of Russian peacekeepers from the Transnistrian region. The narrative is usually accompanied by exaggerations about the importance of the peacekeeping mission controlled de facto by Russia and the separatist regime in Tiraspol and the risks of the escalation of the frozen conflict. In fact, Chisinau demands the withdrawal of the ammunition stored on the left bank of the Dniester and of a Russian military contingent that officially guards the warehouse.
The warnings related to the risk of the Republic of Moldova getting closer to the West, especially to NATO, represent another topic of manipulation, given that this topic is not even discussed. And the narrative regarding the economic collapse of Ukraine due to its proximity to the West is manipulative - the crisis in Ukraine was caused by the Russian Federation, which occupied the Crimean peninsula and supports the separatist structures in eastern Ukraine.

The narratives aim to make the West responsible for the situation in Ukraine and to justify Russian aggression.
NEWS: ""The week was tense. The West escalates the situation and speculates on the alleged invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The dialogue regarding security guarantees is muffled by informational challenges. Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron discussed the situation around Ukraine and Russia's dialogue with the West... Putin reminded both Biden and Macron how the current crisis came to be. The West found a convenient topic - Crimea. But how many were until Crimea, how many initiatives Russia had, what it heard in response - all were ignored. They reached what we see today.
[...]
Macron makes it clear that, in his opinion, Russia violates the sovereignty of Georgia, Moldova, and the main claim is Crimea. Vladimir Putin: ""It's not like that at all. Did we carry out any operation in Crimea or elsewhere? In a normal country and with a normal leadership? Not. I have never done such a thing. It didn't even cross our minds. Why did the Western countries support the coup? From that moment, for us the leadership in Ukraine, the source of the leadership, was the coup, but not the will of the people.

The second reason is that when the Minsk Agreements were signed, there was not this intense Russian military presence on its borders"". Macron forgot that 7 years ago, during the signing of the Minsk Agreements, a real war was taking place in Ukraine , between the troops from Maidan and the fighters from Donbass [...]""
NARRATIVES: 1. The West is escalating the situation in Ukraine. 2. The current crisis is the result of the West's refusal to discuss security issues. 3. In 2014, a coup took place in Ukraine, and the leadership was taken over by an illegitimate regime. 4. Russia did not annex the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, but was forced to save the population there. 5. Kyiv does not respect the Minsk Agreements.
CONTEXT: The situation at the eastern border of Ukraine has worsened recently, as a result of the concentration of Russian troops and weapons in the respective area. It is the most tense phase of the hybrid war waged by Russia since 2014, after the annexation of Crimea and the start of armed actions in the Ukrainian Donbass region. The Kremlin claims that it will not attack Ukraine, but Western officials say that the danger of a Russian invasion is very high. European leaders are making diplomatic efforts to ease the situation.
The annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass were also doubled by a well-developed and aggressive anti-Ukrainian propaganda, which has been present on all Russian television channels for eight years and intensifies in times of crisis such as the current one. One of the Kremlin's main propagandists is Vladimir Solovyov, the moderator of a daily talk show on the state television station Rossia 1, ""Evening with Vladimir Solovyov"", and the show ""Moskva. Kremli. Putin"" which appears on Sundays and reports time for an hour about the actions of the Russian president during the week. Rossia 1 broadcasts throughout the territory of the Russian Federation, but also in the post-Soviet space, including the Republic of Moldova. Television was banned on the territory of Ukraine in 2014, as a measure to combat Russian propaganda. And other Russian TV stations were banned in Ukraine and in the Baltic States for the same reason. Most of the Russian stations tended to reflect the events in Ukraine, starting with 2014, the Kremlin's media policy being very aggressive towards Kiev. The equidistant and democratic press in Russia is harassed by the power from the Kremlin, many media sources being closed, others being declared ""foreign agents"", and several Russian journalists were forced to emigrate from the Russian Federation.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to accuse the West of the situation in Ukraine and to justify Russian aggression in this country.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The West, especially the USA, have shown concern about the possibility and even the imminence of a new Russian invasion of Ukraine and have mentioned information obtained by the secret services about the gathering of significant forces on the Russian-Ukrainian border . The situation is escalated not by the West, but by Russia, which made a new demonstration of force. The Kremlin is trying to obtain more benefits in negotiations with the West through military pressure. The West did not attack the territorial integrity of Russia, on the contrary, the latter, either directly or through its interlocutors in Donbass, occupied part of the Ukrainian territory. This Russian aggression determined the EU and the USA to massively support Ukraine, financially and militarily.
The war in Ukraine began in 2014, with the annexation of Crimea by Russia, after pro-Western forces came to power in Kiev. Russia responded in this aggressive manner to the Ukrainian Maidan, the large-scale demonstrations that took place in Kiev and other cities in Ukraine for the European course of the country, after Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych refused to sign, under pressure from the Kremlin, the Association Agreement to the European Union. The protests of 2013-2014 were popular, not a coup. Against the background of the protests since then, President Yanukovych fled the country. He was dismissed by the Parliament because he no longer exercised his constitutional powers. The leadership of Ukraine was elected following free and democratic elections, organized after protests - the presidential elections in May 2014 and the legislative elections in October 2014.
Vladimir Putin illegally annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, threatening the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The international community condemned this annexation, which it qualifies as an act of aggression against Ukraine and a violation of international law.
The statement that the Kiev authorities would have violated the Minsk Agreements is also false. On the contrary, during the 8 years of war, Kiev has accused Moscow several times of violating the agreement that primarily provides for a ceasefire. Also, Moscow continued to support the armed formations in Donbass, contrary to art. 10 of the document. At the same time, the Russian Federation, by proposing the recognition of the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbass region, violates not only this document, but also international law, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The recent vote in the State Duma to recognize the RPL and RPD is a new step for the Kremlin to control these Ukrainian territories. Publication / Media:

LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: Russia has mobilized, starting with the end of 2021, significant forces and combat equipment around Ukraine - on the Black Sea and in occupied Crimea, along the Russian-Ukrainian border and in Belarus. This aggressive stance was doubled by Moscow's ultimate demands, which wants guarantees that NATO will never accept Ukraine in its ranks, but also that the Alliance will practically withdraw its forces from ex-communist member states.
Russia's aggression in the region is not a new phenomenon. In 2007 it launched a massive cyber attack against Estonia, in 2008 it invaded Georgia, in 2014 it invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Russia's aggressiveness has generated concerns among NATO states, especially since 2014. Ex-communist or ex-Soviet member countries, which have a bad historical experience with Russia, first with the Tsarist Empire, then with the USSR, which imposed on them communist totalitarian regimes and maintained, in many of them, military contingents, they requested the consolidation of the eastern flank of the North Atlantic Alliance. One of the measures taken by NATO was the formation of four battle groups in Poland and the Baltic states, whose total forces amount to approximately 4,500 soldiers.
The current crisis at the borders of Ukraine has led the Alliance to further strengthen its forces on the eastern flank. The United States, NATO's main military power, sent the most important additional troops, several thousand soldiers, one thousand of whom are in Romania, in Task Force Cougar. It is a temporary deployment, so within the Alliance, the problem of forming a battle group, similar to those in Poland and the Baltic states, to be permanently present in Romania was raised; France offered to lead that group.
OBJECTIVE: To victimize Russia, presenting it as a target of NATO aggression. To undermine NATO's measures to strengthen the eastern flank.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: ""The mobilization of Russian forces around Ukraine is also a threat to NATO member states, given that a conflict in Ukraine could affect their security, even indirectly, through waves of refugees. However, Russia also behaved aggressively towards NATO member states - disinformation and fake news campaigns and attempts to interfere in electoral processes, all aimed at destabilizing them internally, constant harassment of NATO planes and ships in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, a harsh rhetoric towards the Alliance, etc. Russian officials have said over time that Romania can be a target of Russia because it hosts the anti-missile shield, Moscow. In addition, the states in the region, which have the experience of Russia's historical aggression, are really worried when, not far from their borders, Russia mobilizes such important forces.
The statements regarding the militarization of the Black Sea region by NATO are also false. The presence of NATO forces in the Black Sea is strongly limited by the Montreaux Convention. According to it, the states that are not bordering the Black Sea can simultaneously send only a limited number of ships to the Black Sea and for a limited period of time. From the neighboring NATO states, Romania and Bulgaria failed to sufficiently modernize their navy. Regarding countries that are not NATO members, Russia practically destroyed, in 2008 and 2014, the navies of Georgia and Ukraine. The result is that Russia is the dominant power in the Black Sea and it is the one that militarized this region.
Regarding Russia's assurances that it does not intend to attack this country and promotes peace, it should be noted that, in the ex-Soviet space, Russia carried out brutal campaigns against the Chechen Islamist rebels, practically destroying Grozny, it intervened in 1992 alongside the separatist forces from Transnistria, fought wars against Georgia and Ukraine. Moscow also supports separatist entities in three independent states - the Republic of Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine - and maintains military contingents in them. Russia is, at the same time, the first European country that invaded, after the Second World War, another country on the continent and captured part of its territory.
TRUTH: NATO is considering the formation of a permanent battle group in Romania; this would be similar to the four existing in Poland and the Baltic countries, which each have around a thousand soldiers. Publication / Media:

These false narratives are promoted by one of the most controversial Romanian journalists, Ion Cristoiu, and amplified by the Kremlin spokesperson, Sputnik.
NEWS: Friday, February 11, 2022, 11:42 p.m. Der Spiegel published on its website, under the signature of four editors - Maik Baumgartner, Matthias Gebauer, Martin Knobbe and Fidelius Schmid (Ilf and Petrov launched writing in two, the German press inaugurates writing in four !) - the article titled: ""CIA expects a Russian attack next week"" which debuts as Breaking News, Cristoiu shows in his analysis.
Cristoiu reproduces precisely, at the beginning, the assumptions of Spiegel who says that, according to his information, ""the USA warned its allies in Europe that they fear a Russian attack on Wednesday"" [...] The Romanian journalist observes that the information has spread all over the planet without raising question marks and because, unlike Bild, Spiegel proceeded more subtly and therefore more treacherously. For example, unlike Bild, Spiegel does not invoke ""a particular intelligence service"", but even the CIA and the Secret Services of the Pentagon [...] Cristoiu even shows that Der Spiegel, The Guardian, CNN, BBC, Deutsche Welle, institutions of the press with claims to be examples of correctness, have proven, from the point of view of fabrications, to be far superior to OTV, the famous television of Dan Diaconescu [...] Cristoiu also observes that the ordinary manipulations of the Western media in the matter The crises in Ukraine are strikingly similar to those during the terrorist period of December 1989"">>. NARRATIVES: 1. The Western press misinforms about the crisis in Ukraine. 2. The Western press is sensationalist, just like the defunct OTV television, and it invents news. 3. The crisis in Ukraine is a diversion of the West meant to divert attention, just as terrorists were invented during the Romanian Revolution so that the Iliescu group could take over power. 4. (default) Russia is not an aggressor in Ukraine.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Starting with the spring of 2021, Russia, a state that already invaded Ukraine in 2014 and since then supports the separatist forces in Donbass, threatens with an intensification of violence and a new attack. In the spring of 2021, Russia mobilized significant forces near the borders of Ukraine, and after their withdrawal following the talks between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden, it mobilized them again at the end of the year. Following the second mobilization, Ukraine was almost surrounded, Russian forces being present in the occupied Crimea and in the Black Sea (where warships from other areas were also brought), along the common border and in Belarus , where joint exercises with the local army were organized. The Russian forces also have at their disposal important quantities of heavy, offensive weapons, and their size and positioning have generated concern in Kiev and in the West. In response to these concerns, Russia formulated demands, ultimately requesting guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand eastward, although the application for membership is the sovereign prerogative of each state; moreover, Moscow also demanded the withdrawal of the Alliance to the positions from the end of the Cold War. Practically, against the background of a demonstration of military force and the implicit threat that this force will be used (Russia has never ruled out a war, it only said that it does not want one) the Kremlin wants to restore the security architecture in Europe and return to a system of relations between the great powers specific, rather, to the 19th century, when Europe was dominated by empires.
Under the pretext that its security is threatened, Russia opposes the sovereign desire of Ukraine to choose its own future and has created in its east a focus of instability in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions by sponsoring and openly supporting the separatists, including through the company of mercenaries Wagner.
Russian propaganda marches intensively on building an image of the aggressor of the West, when in fact it is Russia that has undertaken a series of aggressive actions in the region and beyond, resorting either to conventional means or to hybrid techniques. The invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, cyber attacks, disinformation operations, attempts to interfere in the electoral processes of some Western states have been part of the arsenal used by Moscow to achieve its goals for more than a decade. political.
Ion Cristoiu seems to take Russia's statements as self-evident, that it is not about any kind of preparation for war, and seeks to ridicule the Western press and the way it reports on the crisis in Ukraine. Cristoiu includes the entire Western press in the distinct category of tabloids and, moreover, he also takes up the claims of Russian propaganda (but also of the right-wing, populist zone in the West) regarding its credibility.
The approach is made in the conditions in which Ion Cristoiu has serious credibility problems and is associated with exactly the type of non-journalistic approach that he now accuses a series of publications that have built a solid credibility over decades of activity. Ion Cristoiu, who comes from the communist press, led, after the Revolution, Evenimentul Zilei, a daily known at the time precisely because he brought the tabloid style to Romania and because he invented news (the ones with the hen that gives birth to live chickens or with the girl with two heads). In the years after the Event of the Day, Ion Cristoiu had collaborations with the so-called ""televisions of the moguls"" which were accused over time that, in the political/economic interest of the owners, they carried out numerous disinformation and manipulation campaigns the public.
The crisis in Ukraine was not invented by the West, as Ion Cristoiu would like to show. Russia is the one that, in 2013, put huge pressure on Ukraine to stop signing the Association Agreement with the EU. When the population revolted and removed the regime that had given up pro-European aspirations, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and played a role in the following events in Donbass - the start of the insurrection, the war, the proclamation of the separatist republics, which would not last without Moscow's support. The current crisis at the borders of Ukraine was triggered when Russia, without being provoked in any way, mobilized a powerful army, positioned it around Ukraine, then, with this threat of force, issued ultimate demands; therefore, it is a crisis created entirely by Russia, to which the Western chancelleries reacted in an attempt to prevent a war and which was reflected as such by the press.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing the idea that Russia will not attack Ukraine and that public opinion must be more relaxed on this subject. The discrediting of the Western media. Portraying Russia as an innocent victim of Western propaganda.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Western press is closely following the crisis in Ukraine and the troop movements that Russia is making at the borders of Ukraine, where it has unprecedentedly brought around 130,000 soldiers and heavy combat equipment. All the points of view of the actors involved (including Russia), reports from the scene, analyzes by experts, etc., are constantly presented, so that the public can get a complete picture. In the same Western press, there were also criticisms that targeted the estimates and forecasts of the intelligence services (which contradicted the analyzes of some civilian experts) or the statements of some officials regarding the imminence of a conflict.
The way in which Ion Cristoiu tries to draw parallels between Western media institutions of international prestige and tabloid institutions - the Bild tabloid with the investigative publication Der Spiegel, CNN with Dan Diaconescu's OTV - is reminiscent of a ridicule technique frequently used by propaganda Russian to trivialize and ironize at the same time the credible Western press. Ion Cristoiu even appeals, as far as CNN is concerned, to arguments typical of the American populist right and former president Donald Trump, who without presenting any evidence constantly sent the news that did not agree with him as ""fake news"", despite numerous evidences that proved exactly the opposite.
It should be noted that Russia and its propaganda followed the same thesis, that the media and Western officials are creating hysteria and want to induce panic among public opinion.
All the publications cited above mentioned, on sources, an information given by the United States to its European allies. It is about estimates made on the basis of specific information that the intelligence services have at their disposal, estimates that said that ""the attack could already take place next Wednesday"", ""der Angriff konnte bereits am kommenden Mittwoch söhlen"" (the emphasis belongs truthful). Ion Cristoiu ignores, therefore, a matter of extremely important nuance, taken as such by all the press that he denounces: no one said that the war will break out on Wednesday, but only that it could break out starting from that day. Practically, Ion Cristoiu does exactly what he accuses others of doing: he lies and manipulates despite the evidence.
Also with the aim of misleading, Ion Cristoiu, taken over by Sputnik, makes a forced parallel between the current headlines of the Western press and the manipulations during the 1989 Revolution in order to give the reader a local dimension of the phenomenon.

Kiev's counter-arguments to these narratives were categorized as propaganda in the style of Joseph Goebbels.
NEWS: ""Kiev's statements about the direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk, which, apparently, are not provided for by the Minsk Peace Agreements, are similar to Goebbels' propaganda,"" said Thursday the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov at a press conference held after the negotiations with the head of the MAE of Great Britain, Liz Truss.
""It is about the school of Goebbels, or, possibly, a case of surpassing the art of the main propagandist of the Third Reich. It is a case when lies are told openly, the written resolutions of the UN Security Council are rejected [...] it is a very comfortable position for demagogues who try to justify their point of view, trying to rewrite the Minsk Agreements Lavrov said.
[...]
The actual negotiations are blocked due to Kiev's refusal to fulfill the ""political points"" of the Minsk Agreements. In particular, Kiev does not want to have a direct dialogue with the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, it is against the introduction of a special statute for region and requests the transfer of the border with Russia in Donbass under the control of Kiev until the political component of the agreements is fulfilled"". NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine is obliged by the peace agreements and UN resolutions to negotiate with separatists from Donetsk and Luhansk 2. The official narratives of Kiev are propaganda elements, inspired by the work of Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Public Propaganda in Nazi Germany.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: Against the background of the increasing risk that the Russian Federation will launch an invasion of Ukraine, in the context of the military encirclement of this country and the concentration of over 130 thousand soldiers at its borders, high-ranking Russian officials and the pro-Kremlin press have resumed the narratives about Ukraine's refusal to respect the Minsk Peace Agreements. These official messages, but also the media narratives, are a reaction to the statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, who declared on February 9 that Kiev will not accept a direct dialogue with the self-proclaimed republics during the Normandy Format negotiations. ""I think that Russia will again insist on a direct dialogue. Again he will receive our refusal,"" said Kuleba.
Lavrov launched his narratives in the context in which the Kremlin is trying to present Ukraine as an aggressor in Donbass. The head of diplomacy of the Russian Federation declared in November 2021 that Ukraine is Nazi and Russophobic, a narrative debunked by Veridica.ro. Regarding Ukraine, Moscow massively distributes different narratives about the ""coup d'état"" of 2014, Russophobia, ""fake state"", ""colony of the West"" in the context of the launch of the conflict in Donbass, resulting in over 13 thousand victims and illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula, condemned by the international community.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to exonerate Russia in the context of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, placing all the blame on Kiev, which is accused of refusing to respect the Minsk Peace Agreements, but also of increasing tensions on the border with Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Minsk peace accords do not provide for direct negotiations between Kiev and the separatist leaders, considered terrorists by Ukraine. The agreements provide for ""a general national internal dialogue"", being the period that followed the Euromaidan in Kiev and the need to legitimize the position of the new Ukrainian authorities. Nowhere in the peace agreements is there any mention of any obligation of Kiev to discuss with separatist leaders or with mercenaries financed by Moscow. The 2015 Agreement provides for a discussion on the future of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but only within the Trilateral contact group, which includes Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE. In this group, negotiations take place without the participation of the separatists. This legal reality is denied by the Kremlin, and the absence of direct contacts between Kiev and the separatists is an opportunity for the dissemination of false news regarding the ""belligerent intentions"" of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian authorities have given up several times to talk with the leaders of the self-proclaimed republics about the situation in the east of the country, mentioning that a dialogue with them would mean legitimizing Russian aggression.
There is nothing in the UN resolutions about Ukraine's obligation to talk with the separatists. On the contrary, the UN recognized through the resolution ""The Territorial Integrity of Ukraine"" that Russia is part of the conflict in Donbass and it is exactly with it that Kiev is conducting negotiations in the Trilateral contact group, established in 2014. In other words, Russian officials, not Ukrainian ones, are those who lie when they talk about the Minsk Peace Agreements.
The comparison of Ukrainian diplomats with the propaganda machine of Joseph Goebbels during Nazi Germany is not accidental either. It is about the deepening of a metanarrative regarding Ukraine - ""Nazi state, encouraged by the West"". According to the multiple false narratives distributed by the pro-Kremlin media, Ukraine is a Nazi state, dangerous for the existence of Russia, despite the fact that the Nazi ideology was condemned and it is forbidden in Ukraine, like the communist one.
NUTS OF TRUTH: Ukraine does not want to fulfill a provision of the peace agreement regarding the holding of local elections in Donbass, considering that these elections cannot be free as long as the Russian army or mercenaries supported by Moscow are on the streets. In fact, Ukraine cannot even hold elections on a territory not controlled by it. Kiev conditions the holding of the vote on the withdrawal of all troops from its territory. The Kremlin, however, presents this position of Ukraine as a refusal to respect the truce. Publication / Media:

This resumes the old false narratives regarding the existence of a Moldovan people different from and older than the Romanian one.
NEWS: ""The humanitarian-economic component becomes a priority for Romanian politics when it comes to the Republic of Moldova. Bucharest prides itself on every help it offers to create the image of a friend who knows each other when needed. But Moldova's economic problems are the direct consequence of its pro-Romanian policy, due to which Chisinau's collaboration with the Eurasian Economic Union is reduced to a minimum.
The Republic of Moldova even proclaimed its independence in 1991 in favor and with the support of Romania. It was assumed that independent Moldova would survive thanks to the collaboration with Romania, and the mandatory condition of this collaboration was the minimization of economic, political, cultural contacts with Russia. 31 years have passed and it can be seen that, from an economic point of view, the bet on Romania was wrong.
Bucharest is preparing the gradual annexation of Moldova. Bucharest and Chisinau carry out joint projects in energy, defense, culture. The joint meeting of the governments of the two states is another step towards depriving Moldova of state sovereignty. This will lead to the revision of the borders in Eastern Europe, and the absorption of Moldova by Romania, a NATO member state, will mean the automatic attraction of Moldova in NATO"".
[...]
Instead of aggressive unionism, Bucharest switched to the tactic of ""soft power"" and the continuous exclusion of the Moldovan language not only from the official circuit, but also from the consciousness of the Moldovans. This in the conditions that Moldova as a state and Moldovans as a people are older than Romania and the Romanians have more rights to historical superiority.
Polls reveal the disappointment of Moldovans with the idea of ​​union. This fact determined Bucharest to switch to a new work format in this direction"".
NARRATIVES: 1. Bucharest and the current government from Chisinau are preparing the union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania, and the joint meeting of the two governments is an important step in this direction. 2 Republic of Moldova proclaimed their independence from the USSR in the interest of Romania and with its contribution. 3. After independence, the Republic of Moldova had a pro-Romanian policy, including in the economic field, which distanced it from the East and proved disastrous. 4. There is a distinct and older Moldavian people and language than the Romanian people and language. 5. Despite Bucharest's insistence, the idea of ​​union is increasingly unpopular among the citizens of the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On February 11, the fifth joint meeting of the Governments of the Republic of Moldova and Romania took place in Chisinau, followed by the signing of 13 bilateral agreements and understandings regarding, among other things, the granting of non-refundable financial assistance to the Republic of Moldova in the amount of 100 million euros for projects and initiatives in various fields, the reduction or cancellation of roaming tariffs, the construction of a bridge over the Prut in Ungheni, the consolidation of the bridge from Giurgiulesti (Galati), etc.
The relations of the Republic of Moldova with Romania have always been viewed with suspicion in Moscow, given the historical context, in the conditions where the current territory of the Republic of Moldova was a component part of the Romanian space, being annexed by Tsarist Russia in 1812. A possible (re)unification of the Republic of Moldova with Romania has become one of the ""scarecrows"" that Russian propaganda, as well as some politicians from Chisinau, use to fuel the phobias of a part of society, especially national minorities.
The narratives about the unification (annexation) of the Republic of Moldova, the loss of statehood, along with those regarding the possible accession of the Republic of Moldova to NATO (even if it is not ready for this, so that it would not be accepted in the Alliance), the dangers that the approach to The EU, the existence of the Moldovan language (promoted intensively since the Soviet period) are often used by the Russian media, politicians from Moscow and pro-Russians from Chisinau, which perpetuates the division of society.
OBJECTIVE: To present Romania as a revanchist state, which aspires to the annexation of the Republic of Moldova, and the current pro-European government as one that is governed by the interests of the West, to the detriment of the national ones. To inoculate the idea that the poverty, economic crises and failures of the Republic of Moldova are caused by the intention to align with Western standards. To return to the speculations about the existence of the Moldovan language as the ""mother"" of the Romanian language.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Joint government meetings have been held periodically since 2012, but neither at any of these meetings nor in official talks was the issue of the union of the two states discussed, Romania being the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic Moldova.
The Republic of Moldova declared its independence on August 27, 1991, as did all 15 states of the former USSR, in the context of perestroika and the breakup of the Union. In the years that followed, the governments from Chisinau pursued a fairly faithful policy towards Moscow - unlike the Baltic states, which had obtained their independence earlier and opted from the very beginning for a rapprochement with the West, being admitted to the EU and NATO - and decided to join the Commonwealth of Independent States, controlled by Russia.
The trade of the Republic of Moldova remained deeply dependent on Russia, which caused the economic crisis of 1998, probably the most serious that the country faced in the years after independence. In the last seven years, Romania has become the main commercial partner and the main market for Moldovan goods, but this happened after Russia imposed sanctions and additional taxes on Moldovan goods several times, the last time after Chisinau signed the Association Agreement with the EU.
The theory about the existence of the Moldovan language, distinct from the Romanian language and, more recently, as being the very one from which the Romanian language originates, represents a continuation of Soviet propaganda from the interwar period. Then Moscow created an artificial state entity east of the Dniester - the Moldovan Socialist Autonomous Republic - intended as a bridgehead for the annexation of Bessarabia; in order to justify their territorial claims and undermine the Romanian state, the Soviets invented theses regarding the existence of two peoples and two languages. These theses were intensively promoted by some governments from Chisinau after independence, when even a Romanian-Moldovan dictionary was published.
Even if it is not an option for the majority of citizens of the Republic of Moldova, polls attest to an increase in the number of followers of the union with Romania. According to a sociological survey presented last week, 34.4% of respondents would vote for union, ten times more than a decade ago. Also, the Public Opinion Barometer, the most famous survey in the Republic of Moldova, shows that the number of supporters of the union has doubled since 2015.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: On Friday, February 11, a new joint meeting of the governments of the Republic of Moldova and Romania took place, at which an ""unprecedented openness"" was emphasized for the relations between the two states. Publication / Media:

The meeting between Zelenski and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock was canceled, a new blow for Kiev. Neither was the French minister of foreign affairs did not arrive in Kiev, he refused at the last moment. At the same time, the fate of Ukraine was being decided without Ukraine, in other parts. The meeting between V. Putin and E. Macron took place in Moscow, and Biden met in Washington with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. In other words, while Washington is preparing Ukraine for war, until the last drop of blood of the Ukrainian child, the fate of its independence is decided without it. Here is the question: was the fate of Kiev decided in Moscow and Washington or not yet?"" >> NARRATIVES: 1. Washington is preparing Ukraine for war. 2. NATO will install anti-missile shields in Ukraine, on the border with Russia, to control Russian territory. 3. The fate of Ukraine is decided without her, in Washington and Moscow.
CONTEXT: Ukraine has recently become the central topic on the international agenda, with the deployment of Russian troops at the Russian-Ukrainian border. This country, once very close to the Russians, has been in conflict with the Russian Federation since 2014, after the annexation of Crimea and the start of a war in the Donbass region. The EU and the US have declared their firm support for Kiev, while the Kremlin makes a show of force and demands written guarantees from NATO that it will not accept Ukraine in its ranks and will withdraw its forces from the ex-communist states admitted after the war Cold.
This week, several high-level meetings were held in which an attempt was made to de-escalate the situation. French leader Emmanuel Macron was in Moscow on Monday and in Kiev on Tuesday, where he pleaded for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. American President Joe Biden met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and both reiterated their position regarding the economic sanctions that will be imposed on Russia if it invades Ukraine. The German chancellor also discussed with the French and Polish leaders.
Beyond recent developments, Ukraine has been at war with Russia for 8 years. With the annexation of the Crimean peninsula and the launch of separatist actions in Donbas, Russia is also waging a very aggressive informational war against Ukraine - campaigns of fakes and disinformation in all media and official television stations.
The talk show ""Vremea pokajet"" appeared in 2014, against the backdrop of the events in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, is a show broadcast daily on Pervii Kanal (1 TV), the main television station in the Russian Federation. In the autumn editions in 2014, topics exclusively related to the events in Ukraine were discussed. The titles of some editions of the last week: The fate of Ukraine has been decided, The war is inevitable, When will the war begin?, Macron's great trip, etc. can easily exemplify the themes of the discussions within this broadcasts. The station Pervii kanal is broadcast in all the former Soviet republics. In the Republic of Moldova it is rebroadcast by Primul in Moldova, owned by representatives of the Socialist Party of Igor Dodon.
OBJECTIVE: To present Russia as a victim and the West as an aggressor that uses Ukraine. To create justifications for Moscow's mobilization of forces. At the same time, the idea is promoted that the great powers decide, in fact, the fate of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The EU and the US deliver weapons to Ukraine not to attack Russia, but so that this country can defend itself against a new Russian aggression, after the Kremlin annexed Crimea, caused a conflict in the Russian-speaking Donbas region of Ukraine supports two separatist regimes there.
Ukraine is not a member of NATO and the Alliance cannot install anti-missile shields in this country. On the contrary, Russia justifies its aggressive actions through the hypothetical fact that NATO could install systems on its border and propagandistic statements that, in the event of Ukraine and Georgia joining the Alliance, it would endanger its security. No NATO country has ever threatened Russia, on the contrary, the Kremlin regime took over the aggressive political rhetoric of the USSR and wants to maintain its influence and full control in the post-Soviet states. At the same time, Putin is trying to divide Western countries and undermine their democratic systems.
As for the narrative that the fate of Ukraine is decided without it, in Washington and Moscow, the discussions that took place in this context go beyond the local geographical framework, after the Kremlin massed numerous troops and military weaponry on its western border, a threat aimed at , besides Ukraine, and Poland or the Baltic states. Also, Russia has troops and supports a separatist regime in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. The concern of the West was caused by Russia after it presented several ultimative demands to NATO and the USA, which are not only related to Ukraine's non-adherence to the Alliance, but also target other EU and NATO member states. The discussions that took place this week referred to the situation in Ukraine and were coordinated with Kyiv. At the same time, they involved parties interested in European and global stability, not because the West neglected Kiev. Publication / Media:

These false narratives start from the statements of the Archbishop of Tomis, Teodosie, and are amplified by Sputnik. At the same time, the idea is promoted that Putin and Russia have nothing to do with communism, which was imposed by the West.
NEWS: ""In the midst of Russophobic and anti-Putin propaganda, IPS Teodosie, the archbishop of Tomis, surprises again by saying his opinion about the Russian president.
[...]
""Mr. Putin, who is so circulated these days and seen so black, is not as black as the world presents him"", declared IPS Teodosie in the program he participates in weekly on Radio Dobrogea. ""I said it and I say it without fear and without any hesitation: he is the greatest builder of the Holy Mountain and of Jerusalem. In his country, both Putin and Medvedev are builders. And I followed in their footsteps on a trip and - I marveled at how much sacrifice they made.""
The archbishop also drew attention to an important aspect. There is a dimension of Russophobic and Putinophobic propaganda that links Russia and what is Russian to the tragic memory of communism.
Communism as an ideology, points out IPS Teodosie, is not a Russian product. Marx and Engels, the fathers of communism, were German intellectuals, trained at the great universities of the West and who wrote their work and laid the foundations of the communist ideology in Paris and London, not in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
[...]
Love for the Romanian people, for their freedom, for their Christian values, for their humor and feelings, many ""politically incorrect"", but justified by life: here is the real opponent of Russophobic propaganda.
[...]
The historical shadows of the relationship between Romanians and Russians seem, at least in official Romanian politics, to be the ones that matter in defining the relations between the two states. Simply put, Eastern Romanian politics is marked by a false but dark historical memory of the unfriendliness between Russians and Romanians.
[...]
Simply criticizing, saying things by name, being inconsistent with the official line, is denounced as a Russian action. For a political class that is increasingly reduced intellectually and lacks love of country, Russophobia seems to have become a substitute for patriotism.
But the reason is a perverse one. The servitude to the current ""strategic partners"", the fact that Romania has increasingly become an annex of the regional interests of some great powers in the Black Sea region, the fact that the resources are given to us without negotiation and that the anti-corruption fight has liquidated the power poles in Romania more effectively than the ""class struggle"" had done in the 50s, it had to be somehow justified.
Likewise, the revolution of immorality, which upsets, probably irreparably, the settlement of Romanian society, had to be explained and defended. And the best defense was the invocation of a supposed ""Russian alternative"", which would be more frightening. [...]"" NARRATIVES: 1. Vladimir Putin is better than Putinophobic and Russophobic propaganda presents him and he sacrificed himself for the Church. 2. Russia has nothing to do with communism, which is not a Russian but a Western product. 3. The official speech in Romania is Russophobic. 4. The history regarding Russia's hostile acts towards Romania is false. 5. Russophobia is used to mask the lack of patriotism, the transformation of Romania into a colony of the West, the undermining of the traditional values ​​of Romanian society. 6. The anti-corruption fight liquidated the power poles in Romania.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The image of Vladimir Putin is, at this moment, associated by many with Russia's aggressive policy and the risk that it will invade Ukraine again, thus starting a new war in Europe. At the same time, Putin's image also suffered because of the news regarding the numerous anti-democratic slippages of his regime, so that they are now trying to beautify this image.
The Archbishop of Tomis, Teodosie, is one of the most controversial figures of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Teodosie signed a commitment with the former Securitate and was targeted by several criminal cases. With the outbreak of the Covid pandemic, Teodosie became the exponent of the corona-skeptics and anti-vaccinists within the Romanian Orthodox Church and defied the regulations in force on several occasions.
Teodosie made numerous controversial statements over time, some of which included the Romanian Orthodox Church. On the other hand, the archbishop of Tomis is appreciated by the Kremlin-affiliated press, which praises him as one of the exponents of sovereignism in Romania. The archbishop of Tomis was declared by Sputnik the public figure of 2021 and the man of the year 2020.
The fragment with Vladimir Putin and Dmitri Medvedev is part of a larger answer given by the Archbishop of Tomis to the question of a listener (the entire fragment can be found in the recording of the show, starting with minute 26'31), who wanted to know if a pity when bank cards are used because they contain a chip. The question refers to a conspiracy theory circulated in ultra-religious circles, according to which the chips contain the ""mark of the Beast"", number 666. The main exponent of this trend was Iustin Parvu, priest and abbot of the Petru Voda Monastery, also associated with the Movement Legionnaire - there are recordings on the Internet in which, on his 92nd birthday, Iustin Parvu is sung, by a nun choir, ""Holy Legionary Youth"". Iustin Parvu, who died in 2013, is seen as one of the early opponents of the so-called ""biometric dictatorship"" (another conspiracy theory that largely overlaps and is sometimes confused with the one regarding the sign of the Beast"") and is also associated with the anti-vaccine movement of today by ActiveNews. This online publication, which promotes various conspiracy theories (the Great Reset), corona-skeptic and anti-vaccine, claims that Iustin Parvu would have prophesied the implantation of chips and the appearance of the Green Certificate.
Teodosie - also promoted by ActiveNews - distances himself from the conspiracy theory regarding the ""mark of the beast"" and states that he also told Iustin Parvu, whom he says was ""very close [...] and I confessed , but the dance also confessed to me"" that, beyond its symbolic meaning, the number 666 is a common one and its simple use or pronunciation has no way of doing any harm, something proven by the fact that the number is even written in the Bible.
Teodosie makes a digression from his explanations regarding the number 666 in which he begins by mentioning that the end of the world is currently being talked about (he does not say explicitly why he made this passage, but 666 appears as the sign of the Beast in the Apocalypse), the mentions Saint Nicholas, the apostle of the Japanese, a Russian born in Smolensk, who in his opinion would have founded the first Christian mission in Japan in the 19th century - a false information, considering that Catholic missionaries had arrived in the Japanese archipelago since the 16th century -, moves on to the presence of the Russians at the ""Holy Mountain"" (Athos) and the ""holy places"" (Israel and the West Bank) and then makes the statements about Putin and Medvedev that were also picked up by Sputnik. Next, Teodosie delimits Putin and Medvedev from communism and says that it was ""planted"" in Russia by the West and that ""Marx and Engels are not from Russia. They have a different origin.""
OBJECTIVE: Washing the image of Vladimir Putin, especially in the eyes of the Orthodox believers, but also victimizing the Russian leader, presented as a target of ""Russophobia"" and Putinophobia. Shifting attention away from Russia's aggressive acts and justifying its position in the context of the current crisis from the borders of Ukraine.Cosmetizing history to distance Russia from communism, but also to hide the numerous hostile acts in its relationship with Romania.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Numerous authoritarian leaders and dictators have sought over time to publicly emphasize their pious side and get closer to religious authorities in an attempt to increase their popularity and gain legitimacy. An example in this sense is that of Saddam Hussein who, although he was an exponent of a secular political movement and took measures to secularize Iraqi society in the first years in which he was in power, changed his optics after he became a pariah of the international community as a result of the invasion of Kuwait. In his attempt to gain the support of the Muslim world, Saddam gave more freedom to religious leaders, ordered that ""Allah al-akbar"" be written on the Iraqi flag (it was said that even his handwriting was used), may the Koran be written in his blood and may more mosques be built. This piety displayed by the dictator does not mean that he is no longer guilty of the mass murders he committed, nor that he stopped committing those crimes after he written Allah al-akbar on the flag - on the contrary, some of the greatest followed that moment.
Similarly, the fact that Vladimir Putin allowed the allocation of some funds to the Church and encouraged the construction/equipment of some premises, did not temper the nature of his regime. The Russian Orthodox Church is an important ally of Vladimir Putin, and Patriarch Kirill had connections with the KGB, from whose ranks Vladimir Putin also comes. The ties between the Kremlin and the Church strengthened while Putin's authoritarian regime consolidated and more and more measures were taken against the opposition, civil society and the independent press; basically, the Church represents a source of legitimacy meant to compensate for the loss of democratic legitimacy. The relations with the Church did not prevent Vladimir Putin from involving Russia in a series of wars and aggressions throughout his entire government: the bloody campaign in Chechnya, the war against Georgia, the intervention in Syria, where the Russian war aviation also bombed civilian targets, including hospitals, the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian leader whose internal opponents have been assassinated or thrown into prison on numerous occasions and whose armed forces have committed aggression and war crimes, all of which are acts that come into conflict with the values ​​promoted by the Church.
Although it is true that Marx and Engels were not Russian, the idea of ​​a communist regime is associated with Russia, the country where the communist ideology was applied as interpreted by local leaders, starting with Lenin. The latter initiated the Bolshevik revolution, was the supreme leader of the communists during the civil war and the founder of the USSR was Russian. Russia was the dominant force, which gave the most union leaders, throughout the existence of the USSR, and the USSR is the power that forcibly imposed communism in Eastern Europe and, at the same time, supported various communist organizations in the West. Nowhere in the western states has power been taken over by local communist movements, which ideologically claim directly from Marx and Engels.
Even if Vladimir Putin would not, because of the period in which he was born, be among the initiators of the communists, the Russian leader comes from a family of communists - Putin's grandfather was a cook for Lenin and Stalin, his father worked for the dreaded NKVD - he himself was a member of the Communist Party and an officer of the dreaded Soviet intelligence service, the KGB, and expressed his admiration for the USSR, whose dismemberment he described as ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the century XX. Russia's aggressive policy under Putin's mandate, the wars against Georgia and Ukraine or the demands that NATO withdraw its forces to the pre-1997 lines show, in fact, that Putin is claiming exactly the territory of the Soviet empire.
Romania's political discourse is categorized as Russophobic because Romania adopted the position of its Western allies and partners, criticized Russia's aggressive policies and advocated for the restoration of the historical truth regarding relations with Russia. These were marked by aggressions, hostile acts and territorial seizures starting with the annexation of Bessarabia in 1812, the capture of the southern counties of Bessarabia in 1871 - although the United Principalities had just fought as an ally of Russia in the war against the Ottoman Empire - the confiscation of the Treasury, the invention of Moldavianism to justify the territorial claims on Romania, the territorial abduction that followed the Soviet pact with Nazi Germany, etc.
The false narratives regarding sovereignty, colonization by the West, traditional values ​​belong to the already classic arsenal used by Moscow both in the official propaganda and in the campaigns in the press and the online environment consisting of fake news and disinformation.
The fight against corruption did not target structures of the Romanian state or its balance, but, on the contrary, its purpose is precisely the building of a strong state of law, in which powers are separated, citizens are equal before the law and different interest groups - essentially groups criminal - not to be above the law.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Romanian Orthodox Church has distanced itself from Teodosie's statements regarding Putin, conveying that ""As it is already known, Archbishop Teodosie is used to pronouncing himself ""sui generis"" including on extra-ecclesiastical topics. By virtue of the diocesan autonomy of which he enjoys and which he chooses to use often in an original way, of course he has the right to express himself freely on any topic, without that meaning that he expresses himself in the name of BOR, but in a strictly personal name. Especially when he expresses himself preferences or various affinities in relation to certain people."" Publication / Media:

The narratives start from a text by the journalist Patrick Andre de Hillerin.
NEWS: ""Official propaganda has been giving the impression for years that the United States is the main investor in Romania. But the truth is the opposite: Romania is an important investor in the USA. And investor without profit. This is the conclusion of an analysis made by journalist Andre Patrick de Hillerin, published in Libertatea.
It analyzes the strong influence of the USA on political, social and economic decisions in Romania. Wikileaks revelations and the daily press show how Romania is influenced in most of its decisions. The Embassy of the United States and not the Parliament or the Government of Romania, is the institution where important decisions for the country are made.
Romanian politicians are not allowed to interfere with justice, not even to defend themselves in front of the prosecutors, let alone exercise the constitutional right to govern, passing laws or reforming the prosecutor's office. But American diplomats have the right to give recommendations, directives, valuable indications to politicians, judges and prosecutors [...] Even indirect investments are not better. After consulting the BNR data, ""out of a total of 90.773 billion euros, the USA did not participate with investments in Romania by even 7%, the contribution in all these years being 6.16 billion dollars. This would be the 5th place , the first 4 being occupied by EU countries (Germany, Austria, France and Italy) [...] In fact, it's like on radio Yerevan. The US is not the investor, but Romania. And the US does not intervene in Romania to protect its investments but to protect its supplier of money [...] The very expensive strategy, assumed by the Romanian state, of equipping the army has a main beneficiary: the USA [...] It seems that we have found our country's project: to support financially the US economy"", concludes Patrick de Hillerin bitterly. One wonders how Romania would have looked if the 20 billion given to the Americans for armaments had been invested in Romanian education"". NARRATIVES: 1. Romania is a US colony that is being manipulated to spend its money unnecessarily on American weapons 2. Romania has become an investor in the American economy without receiving anything in return. 3. The United States interferes in Romanian justice. 4. Washington's claim that investors' interests are protected is unjustified. 5. The money invested in armaments would have been better used for education.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Against the backdrop of Russia's increased militarism in the extended Black Sea region, NATO states decided at the Alliance summit in Wales to allocate 2% of GDP to the defense sector.
The decision of the NATO member countries came after, in the same year 2014, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and began to support separatism in the east of this country in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
Currently, Russia is trying to force the West to accept the conditions formulated on December 17, 2021, namely to divide Europe again into spheres of influence and for NATO to significantly reduce its presence in the ex-communist states (including Romania) and to make firm commitments that it will not expand in the future. One of the goals is to decisively tip the balance of power in the Black Sea and to restore its spheres of influence before the collapse of the USSR in 1991. At the same time, Russia is trying to re-impose a model of negotiations between the great powers, which does not take into account the will and options of smaller states. It should be noted that the ex-communist states asked to be admitted to NATO and agreed to implement a series of reforms in order to be accepted. Decisive for these states was the need for security guarantees precisely in front of Russia, which throughout history has been a regional aggressor; currently, Ukraine, attacked by Russia in 2014, is in this situation and that is why it wants, in its turn, to benefit from NATO protection, especially since Russia has already violated its commitments regarding respecting the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: To undermine Romania's efforts to strengthen its armed forces. To question Romania's membership in NATO and the Romanian-American partnership. To undermine the efforts to consolidate the rule of law.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The theme of the Western colony is one of the most common in Russian propaganda and was also adopted by nationalist circles in Romania, where the influence of the official propaganda of the Ceausescu regime and its emphasis on the idea of ​​""unmixed"" is still felt in internal affairs"". Any attention from the Western partners is charged (not only in Romania, but also in other Eastern European countries) as ""interference in internal affairs"". In fact, when they asked to be admitted to the club of Western states, the Eastern European countries also assumed the observance of some fundamental principles, rights and freedoms, and the warnings from the partners generally aim at the violation of those commitments.
In fact, the West wants among allied countries the strengthening of the rule of law, which attracts the trust of foreign investors who are looking for countries with a strong rule of law to protect their investments they make in such countries. The condition of a strong rule of law is an intrinsic one for Western investors to have the confidence to enter such emerging markets.
For example, countries like Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova do not attract foreign investors in large numbers, because they do not have consolidated democracies in which the rule of law can fully function.
The Sputnik text also contains a downright hilarious phrase, ""Interference in justice is not allowed for Romanian politicians, even to defend themselves in front of prosecutors, let alone exercise the constitutional right to govern, passing laws or reforming prosecutors."" , which denotes either a crude attempt to manipulate, or an inability to understand the principle of separation of powers in the state - the signatory is outraged that ""interference in justice"" is not allowed and confuses the legislative process, the government act (which belongs to the executive) and the act of justice.
In terms of figures, the news from Sputnik takes incomplete erroneous information and untruths uttered by omission. Indeed, the BNR report for 2020 on the size of foreign direct investments places the USA in fifth place among the top direct investors in Romania with 6.16 billion dollars, only that it ""omits"" another 2.27 billion dollars that come from the USA to Romania through through the Netherlands (see page 25 of the BNR report on 2020). This would bring the USA closer to France, which occupies the 3rd place in this top.
On a bilateral level, Romanian investments in the purchase of arms from the USA, those 20 billion dollars invoked by the author, represent a percentage of about 0.06% only of the investments from Europe to the USA in 2020, which total 2,942 billion dollars according to official US statistics.
General Constatin Spinu explained in an interview for Veridica.ro that the Russian secret services have not changed their ""modus operandi"" compared to the Cold War period and that one of the directions of disinformation is the weakening of trust and cohesion within any society that was targeted by such methods.
""I think that we see these narratives not only in Romania. I think that in all the countries of the European Union and in the NATO countries such narratives are rolling. Of course, they are adapted to the local context. We exchange opinions and lessons learned with all our allies and we see that in the Baltic countries there are also such narratives in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, so in all NATO countries, but also in the European Union, in the western core of the European Union. There are narratives adapted for these societies"", said Spanu.
On a different note, the conclusion of the author of Libertatea, Patrick de Hillerin, who matched Spunik's narratives, according to which Romania allocates more money to armaments than to education, is also a false one.
If Romania allocates in line with the majority of NATO states a percentage of 2%, as the member states agreed at the summit of the Alliance in 2014, for education Romania allocated about 2.5% of GDP in 2021, and for 2022 it aims for 4%. Anyway, these are totally different fields that each need funding, so there is no question of comparing them or eliminating the funding of one in order to finance the second.
Against the backdrop of Russia's increased militarism and real threats, including the nominal one against Romania, Bucharest cannot stay with a poorly equipped army exposed to all related security dangers. In order to ensure its security, a state - even a neutral one, such as Switzerland - also needs armed forces, and they must be equipped and trained accordingly, according to the standards in the field, in order to be able to fulfill their mission. The Romanian army joined NATO with Soviet or copied equipment, and over time they ended up being outdated, and it was necessary to replace them. In addition, given that Romania is a NATO member, its equipment must be compatible with NATO's.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: In recent years, Romania bought armaments from the USA, one of the most efficient in the world intended only for the strategic partners of the United States. Publication / Media:

NEWS: Great Britain has sent over a hundred elite special forces representatives to Ukraine as military advisers, writes the British newspaper ""The Mirror"" on February 5.
[...]
The West fuels the hysteria regarding the ""Russian invasion"" of Ukraine starting in the fall of 2021, naming various dates of the ""incursions"", and does not really comment on why these forecasts do not come true.
It has reached the moment when the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, asked the West not to fuel panic, because there were no changes compared to the last eight years of conflict.
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that he is afraid of a military challenge from the Ukrainian troops.
The sending of British special forces to Ukraine can be explained precisely by the fact that Kiev stubbornly refuses to provoke a conflict with Russia by attacking the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics [LNR and DNR].
The representatives of Great Britain are able to push the evolution of the situation in the right direction without the approval of the Ukrainian authorities, organizing a diversion that will provoke a response from the people's republics and escalate the conflict to a level where Russian intervention becomes inevitable, because Moscow will protect its citizens from LNR and DNR."" NARRATIVES: 1. The West, through the British special forces, will generate an escalation of the situation in eastern Ukraine, which will turn into a war with Russia. 2. Kiev refuses to start a war, as the West demands.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: From the fall of 2021, the West is worried about the concentration of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine - a situation that evolved into a real international crisis at the beginning of this year.
The alarm regarding the danger of a Russian attack was raised by Ukraine, but Kiev tempered its speech at a certain point. At the end of January, President Volodymyr Zelenski asked the Westerners not to create panic around the tensions with Russia. He also estimated that the main risk for the country is ""destabilization from within"". Zelenski's message also has an electoral basis, considering the political games in Kiev and the probability that the president will run for a second term. The news about the imminence of a war are of a nature to discourage foreign investors and affect the already weakened economy of Ukraine, something noted, by the way, also by Zelensky.
After Zelensky asked the United States to stop calling the conflict with Moscow ""imminent"", the Russian government media changed the narratives accusing Ukraine of preparing for war against Russia and Donbass. The new version says that it is not there is enough political will in Kiev to launch an attack, therefore the West will give an impetus.Russia argues that the concentration of its troops on the border with Ukraine has a defensive role.
OBJECTIVE: To promote the narrative that the West is trying to force Ukraine to attack Russia. To induce the idea of ​​the existence of tensions between Ukraine and its Western allies. To convince the public opinion in the former Soviet states that Russia has every right to defend its citizens in case of the organization of diversions against the Russophones of Donbass by the West.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In reality, the purpose of the British special forces sent to Ukraine is not to organize diversions on the territory of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The British newspaper ""The Mirror"" writes that the British special forces will teach the Ukrainian armed forces the skills and techniques that can be useful in the event of a Russian invasion - tactics to fight the invaders, how to shoot from a distance with a sniper and sabotage techniques, being defensive actions, not offensive, as the pro-Kremlin press presented the situation. British special forces have been deployed in the region to assist and advise the Ukrainian military. They have a wide range of capabilities that will undoubtedly be very useful to the Ukrainian forces, according to the British publication.
This narrative is an element of anti-Western rhetoric, which aims to present the support of Great Britain, the USA or NATO as a step directed against Russophones and Russia. Veridica.ro also analyzed a fake news of the pro-Kremlin press, according to which the armament offered by the West to Ukraine is expired. It is worth mentioning that the United Kingdom is one of the NATO states that, in the context of the danger of a Russian invasion, offered Ukraine lethal equipment to be able to defend itself.
The fake news directed against Great Britain can be classified as a reaction to the launch of a security cooperation initiative on the London-Warsaw-Kiev axis, discussed during the visit of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to Ukraine. In this sense, the Russian government media developed and concretized the idea of ​​the spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zakharova, who accused the West of preparing a military provocation in Donbass, mentioning the destabilizing role of Great Britain because it sends lethal weapons to Ukraine. Therefore, the article published on Ukraina.ru regarding the destabilizing functions of the British special forces is part of the anti-Western metanarrative.
It is also worth noting the manipulative style of the pro-Kremlin media in presenting the speech of the president Volodymyr Zelensky, who asked the West not to sow panic. The Russian press writes that the leader from Kiev ""stubbornly refused to provoke a conflict with Russia"", which is why the British special forces will intervene. In reality, Zelenski was worried about the collateral effects of the news about the ""imminent war"", which they can cause enormous damage to the economy, causing impoverishment of the population and giving a blow to his rating as a politician.
On February 3 a.c. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov dismantled a series of false narratives by Moscow, stating that Ukraine does not intend to attack Donbass or Crimea. ""We are not planning to attack or occupy, because it is primarily about people's lives, the lives of Ukrainians. We don't want to expose them to such risks"", said the minister. Publication / Media:

The narratives are launched in the context of a regional crisis in which Russia spread disinformation about an alleged NATO threat in the ex-Soviet space.
NEWS: <<As Romania's ambassador to the Republic of Moldova, a unionist will be replaced by a NATO specialist [...] Cristian-Leon Turcanu also worked as an advisor for regional affairs and security policies to the Minister of Business external, as well as within the Department for the Organization of the NATO Summit and the Schengen Programs Implementation Directorate. Turcanu also held the position of ambassador of Romania in Kiev, worked in the US and German embassies. According to the official website of the Romanian MFA, Cristian-Leon Turcanu was the deputy of the Romanian ambassador to the Republic of Moldova, during 2014-2015.
[...] The former ambassador, Daniel Ionita, presented himself as an inveterate unionist, aiming to ""suppress the national identity of the Moldovan people"". More than once he declared that ""there is no Moldovan people"" and accused the citizens of the Republic of Moldova of ""primitive Moldovanism inherited from the Soviet period, wrong visions towards Romania and the Romanian gendarme"". Ionita also actively promoted the idea, supported by the current government in Chisinau, that the Romanian soldiers who fought on the side of fascist Germany in the the second world war, ""liberated Moldova from the Soviet occupation"">>
NARRATIVES: 1. Romania replaces its unionist ambassador from Chisinau with a NATO expert. 2. Bucharest aggressively promotes, through its diplomats, the idea of ​​uniting the Republic of Moldova with Romania, but also a historical revisionism in favor of the ""fascists"".
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The relations of the Republic of Moldova with the West, but especially with Romania and NATO, are followed very carefully in Moscow and in the Russian press, considering the pro-Western views of the majority of the population of the Republic of Moldova, but also the existence of a unionist current on the left of Prutului, which, however, does not enjoy the support of the majority.
In the Russian press, as well as in the Russian-language press in the Republic of Moldova, manipulations and fake news are often promoted, fueled including by the statements of some politicians from Chisinau, in connection with alleged risks regarding the union with Romania or joining NATO, taking control of the government of so-called circles of Western influence, etc.
In connection with the expiry of the Romanian ambassador's mandate in the Republic of Moldova, the MFA from Bucharest announced its proposal for this position, it being Cristian-Leon Turcanu, with a diplomatic career of almost 20 years. However, some media institutions have emphasized, exaggeratedly, a small segment of his diplomatic career, namely, employed at the Department within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that was in charge of organizing the NATO Summit in Bucharest in 2008.
This nuance comes in the context of several articles in the Russian press and partly from the Republic of Moldova about an increasing control that NATO would exercise in the Republic of Moldova in the conditions of geopolitical tensions in South-Eastern Europe, especially between Russia and Ukraine.
At the same time, older narratives promoted by Moscow, the politicians and the pro-Russian media from Chisinau, regarding an alleged interference of Romania in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova, the forcing of the union of the two states and a so-called neo-fascist revivalist spirit, are being repeated. These narratives aim to maintain anti-Romanian and anti-Western phobias among the population, especially among ethnic minorities.
OBJECTIVE: To bring back into the public eye NATO's supposed attempts to consolidate its ""control"" over the Republic of Moldova, including through Romania. To present Romania as a revanchist state, which claims the current territory of the Republic of Moldova, promoting in different ways , including through its diplomats, the union of the two states. To fuel anti-Romanian and anti-Western phobias among the population of the Republic of Moldova. Indirectly, to promote the image of the Russian Federation as a state that defends the interests of the Republic of Moldova and Russian-speaking minorities in the path of Western expansion ( NATO).
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Cristian-Leon Turcanu has almost 20 years of diplomatic experience, during which he held various positions, both within the MFA and in Romanian missions abroad. According to the information presented by the MAE, Cristian-Leon Turcanu worked and led the Directorate of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, being responsible for all bilateral relations with the states in this geographical area. He held the position of general director for communication, public diplomacy and culture, was advisor for regional affairs and security policies to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, worked in the Schengen Program Implementation Directorate. It is true that he also worked in the Department for the Organization of the NATO Summit, a structure created in mid-2007 to deal with the organization of the NATO Summit in Bucharest in April 2008. But bringing to the fore this professional experience of the diplomat and his presentation as a ""NATO expert"" is disinformation intended to highlight the increasingly frequent messages promoted by the Kremlin and the Russian media about the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and the taking over of control over the Republic of Moldova.
In the same vein, the acting ambassador, Daniel Ionita, is presented as an ""inveterate"" unionist, and his statements, such as the one regarding ""primitive Moldovanism"", which provoked criticism from the socialists in April 2021 , are taken out of context. Daniel Ionita later explained that he was referring to some scientific truths, confirmed and recognized by experts, in relation to the so-called Moldovan language and the Moldovan nation, which are inventions initially promoted by the USSR to justify its expansionism and territorial claims over Romania.
Even if there are unionist currents both in the Republic of Moldova and in Romania, this topic has never been discussed at an official level. Romania was the first country to recognize the Independence of the Republic of Moldova from the USSR.

353,856,"NATO is expanding aggressively to the east, and the United States is pushing Ukraine towards a war with Russia",NATO is pushing Moldova towards a war with Russia,False,[],"['NATO', 'the United States', 'Ukraine', 'Russia']",,,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9i6aZmjLj0,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-nato-se-extinde-agresiv-spre-est-iar-statele-unite-imping-ucraina-spre-un-razboi-cu-rusia,,04.02.2022,,,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-nato-se-extinde-agresiv-spre-est-iar-statele-unite-imping-ucraina-spre-un-razboi-cu-rusia,,"The expansion of NATO is a threat to Russia, and the United States is arming and preparing Ukraine for war, claims the Kremlin's main propagandist, Dmitry Kiselev, in an almost two-hour show that reflects the Kremlin's point of view on international politics.
NEWS: The author of the show claims that the Americans are preparing Volodymyr Zelensky for war and arming the Ukrainians as they did with the Georgians in 2008, when Saakashvili gave the order to hit the city of Thinvali, controlled by the separatists, with missiles. ""The situation at the demarcation line with Zelenski's Ukraine in Donbas is so tense that a challenge is possible at any moment... Putin is going to Beijing, at the opening of the Olympics, and Zelenski is being prepared for war. And he is ready. He is as nervous as Saakasvili. Putin once flew to the Olympics in Beijing, in 2008. Then, after numerous provocations, prepared for war and armed by the same United States, Saakashvili gave the order to attack the capital of South Ossetia, Thinvali. Currently, these days, on the threshold of the Olympics, we have a deja vu"".
The author claims that Russia wants a new security model, but NATO forgot that it promised not to expand to the east. ""The problem is not Ukraine and Donbas, although the US wants to reduce everything to Ukraine. Russia proposed in writing a new model of global security... Washington and Brussels insist on the principle of open doors and free choice of allies, forgetting that they promised that NATO would not move a centimeter to the east. In response to the Russian statements, they initially said that there was no such thing, then after the publication of the transcript they said that they were misunderstood then and that, in general, oral does not matter. Sergey Lavrov: now when we present them not oral promises, but written documents, which were signed by all the states of the OSCE, including the US president, I have in mind the Istanbul Declaration of 1999 and the Astana Declaration of 2010, our Western partners they have to get out of a more serious situation. Both documents stipulate the right to choose allies and the need to take into account the security interests of other OSCE states, including the Russian Federation"".
Ukraine, even if it is not a NATO member, is armed by NATO, the author claims. In the show, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, is again quoted, who claims that ""Washington's goal is not the fate of Ukraine but the tension of the situation around the Russian Federation"". The show also says that the five waves of NATO expansion, after 1990, they led to imbalance and the creation of threats to Russia.
Dmitri Kiselev also states that the United States only pretends that they want to help Europe find alternative sources of gas in exchange for the Russian ones, but in reality it is causing a colossal damage.
Also, during the show, he insinuated that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would have called Ukraine a ""coop of chickens"", referring to the comparison used by the US official who said that Russia acts like a fox attacking chickens.
NARRATIVES: 1. The United States is preparing Ukraine for war against Russia, as they did in 2008 with Georgia. 2. Washington's goal is to tense the situation around the Russian Federation. 3. The USA promised that NATO would not expand, but they did not keep their word. 4. NATO expansion is a threat to Russia.
CONTEXT: The Russian Federation has massed significant forces on its border with Ukraine, which has raised the concern of the international community regarding the escalation of the war in Donbas. Since the beginning of the conflict in this region of eastern Ukraine, in 2014, more than 13 thousand people have already died. Against the backdrop of these events, Kiev has definitively distanced itself from Moscow and demands that Ukraine be admitted to NATO. Likewise, another former Soviet republic, Georgia, with two separatist regions on its territory, wants to be under the umbrella of NATO. Moreover, the desire of the two countries to be admitted to the Alliance was officially noted by it since the 2008 summit in Bucharest.
The Baltic states were the first republics from the former USSR that hurried to join NATO, shortly after breaking away from the Soviet empire, in order to ensure their security. While it has concentrated tens of thousands of soldiers and military equipment on the border with Ukraine, the Russian Federation is asking the United States and NATO for written security guarantees on stopping the expansion of NATO to the east, in the former Soviet space, which it considers its sphere of influence . Moreover, it demands the withdrawal of the NATO military infrastructure from the eastern flank of the Alliance. Both requests were rejected by the allies, who pointed out that it is the sovereign right of any state to make the security arrangements it deems appropriate - including joining any alliance. At the same time, the way in which NATO agrees to deploy its troops in its own territory cannot be determined by a third country, as Moscow claims.
TV Rossia 1 is a federal state station, broadcasting throughout the territory of the Russian Federation, and its potential audience is 98% of the country's population. Its programs are rebroadcast in countries from the former USSR and in European countries. The show ""Vesti nedeli"" appears weekly, on Sunday evenings in prime time, and reflects the Kremlin's point of view on foreign policy. Dmitri Kiselev is one of the main promoters of the Kremlin's propaganda, being included on the sanctions list of the EU, Canada and Ukraine for promoting Russian propaganda regarding the annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The filmmaker stated in one of his broadcasts that Russia can turn the USA into radioactive ash.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to present Ukraine, NATO and the USA as aggressors and enemies of the Russian Federation, who can launch an attack on it at any time.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The conflict in Ukraine was provoked by the Russian Federation through the annexation of Crimea in March 2014, and the subsequent support of the separatist insurgency in Donbass, a region predominantly inhabited by ethnic Russians. The separatists supported by the Russian Federation proclaimed two republics, Donetsk and Luhansk, in the Donbass region. The Russian Federation wants to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, the separatist regions being the main instruments of pressure it still has in this country. The conflict started from the fact that the population of Ukraine wanted the country's integration into the European Union, massively protesting President Yanukovych's refusal to sign the Association Agreement with the EU in 2013, a refusal caused by intense pressure from the Kremlin. Following the Russian aggression, Ukraine intensified its efforts to join NATO.
Russia claims that after the collapse of the USSR, the Americans would have promised Moscow that NATO would no longer expand to the East. The Kremlin recently insists that NATO lied to Russia by the fact that the alliance expanded in 1999 and 2004 and asked Washington for written guarantees regarding the exclusion of any new accession to the Alliance, especially Ukraine. The rumors about the promises that the Americans would have made regarding NATO are not fixed in any document. These do not correspond to reality, recently declared Mikhail Gorbachev's translator, Pavel Palajchenko, who participated in the negotiations and had direct access to diplomatic correspondence and transcripts of the conversations. He specified that the problem of NATO expansion was addressed exclusively in the context of the unification of Germany, in the sense of including the territory of East Germany under the umbrella of the Alliance. The problem of further expansion to the east was not raised at the time and even if it was addressed in some discussions - here there are different points of view of historians and the option that the possibility of NATO maintaining its borders was evoked by the secretary of state is also accepted American since then, James Baker - there was no concrete offer from the West, made public or written in any official document. In the mirror, it is interesting to note that Russia flagrantly violated the Budapest Memorandum, a concrete document by which the signatories, including the Russian Federation, guaranteed the territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for it renouncing the nuclear arsenal it possessed.
NATO member states do not pose any danger to the Russian Federation, given that it is a defensive Alliance. NATO's forces in the eastern flank are clearly inferior to those available to Moscow, which has started to conduct mass troop concentrations and massive military exercises in the western part of its territory more and more often. Ukraine and Georgia who want to join the Alliance for the same reason that the Baltic states and those from the former socialist camp wanted it: for fear of the Russian Federation, the successor of the USSR, which attacked them in the past.

354,857,Romania will be dismembered in case of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,Romania will be dismembered in case of a Russian invasion in Ukraine,False,[],"['Romania', 'Russian', 'Ukraine']",,,,,,,https://evz.ro/ardealul-va-fi-luat-de-catre-ungaria-avertismentul-care-cutremura-toata-romania.html?fbclid=IwAR2FIT38AEJ0gAoPtLWy7tI1ERxIDmmFuXPk5af-e0wc2sn3INTUgndZC0I,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-romania-va-fi-dezmembrata-in-cazul-unei-invazii-ruse-in-ucraina,,02.02.2022,,,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-romania-va-fi-dezmembrata-in-cazul-unei-invazii-ruse-in-ucraina,,"Romania will be dismembered by its neighbors if it fights, alongside NATO, in a war against Russia. The false narrative was thrown on the Romanian market with the aim of undermining confidence in NATO, but also to show that, in the current Ukrainian crisis, Russia is not the aggressor.
NEWS: ,, In the increasingly likely event that we will be forced to go to war again with NATO against the Russian Federation and, if with an even greater probability, we will lose the war again, then the dismemberment of Romania will no longer be avoidable , Transylvania will be taken by Hungary, Dobrogea by Bulgaria, Banat by Serbia and Moldova between the Carpathians and the Prut together with Moldova between the Prut and the Dniester will form a single country under the rule of the victorious power. The future Romania will be reduced to two counties, Ilfov and Ialomita. Who wants that? Who will be responsible for such a disaster?"", it is shown in an article published by EvZ.ro, which fully quotes a press release of the Union of Subcarpathian Ruthenians from Romania. NARRATIVES: 1. Romania will be torn into pieces by the Russian Army in the event of a conflict and its territory will be divided between the neighboring states. 2. Romania will be drawn into a war in Ukraine 3. NATO is an organization modeled after Nazi Germany.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: Against the background of the negotiations between the US and Russia regarding the requests made by Moscow on December 17, 2021 to share some spheres of influence between the West and Russia, in parallel with the massing of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine, Moscow has also intensified its propaganda which promotes the Kremlin's agenda.
Ukraine is portrayed as a country led by an extremist fascist-type government by the Russian media, and the West is presented as an imminent threat to Russia's existence. However, in the last almost eight years, it was Russia that illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula, maintains pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine from Luhansk and Donetsk, and currently mobilized - for the second time in less than a year - considerable forces at the borders of Ukraine, which, according to Western and Ukrainian officials, shows that they are preparing a new invasion.
Russia demands to be respected a status of a superpower equal from a political-diplomatic point of view to the USA and China, even if economically it is rather close to the European countries (surpassed by or equal to the most powerful of them, clearly surpassed of the EU as a whole).
Moscow seeks to intimidate through its armed force and the implicit threat of war (officials are careful to repeat that they do not want a war).
In this way, Russia is convinced that it will be able to keep Ukraine in check through the annexations and the wars it maintains on the territory of Ukraine in the hope that the situation in this country will be resolved on the model of the Transnistrian file.
Then, Russia, as an aggressor and combatant alongside the Transnistrian pro-Russian separatists, managed, in July 1992, to conclude a peace between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Moldova and to impose its own ""pacifiers"" who, since then, they never left.
In parallel with the mobilization at the borders of Ukraine, Russia intensified the propaganda that tries to induce a psychosis of the fear of war, especially in the Eastern European states, more precisely those on the front line.
As an important state in NATO's eastern flank, Romania is also a constant target of Russian propaganda. Themes of this do not only appear in Romanian language publications that belong to Russia (sputnik.md), but are also played by communication channels/media publications that, in general, belong to them/are coordinated by characters who have had problems with the law , mostly for corruption.
The theme of the loss of Transylvania by Romania, just as Ukraine lost Crimea following the annexation of Russia, is a recurring theme of Russian propaganda, which Veridica.ro has written about in detail.
This time, the messages are disseminated through the ethnic Ruthenians in Romania and amplified by the Event of the Day.
Romania has 18 minorities on its territory, all represented in the Parliament, and the ethnic groups living in Romania are mostly loyal to the country.
The most numerous, obviously, is the Hungarian one, followed by the Roma and then the Ukrainian one, which represents no more than 50,000 people and those by subgroups.
Of these, the number of Ruthenians is less than 2,000 people, according to the 2011 census, and not 60,000, as presented by this Union of Subcarpathian Ruthenians from Romania. It is led by Mihai Lauruc, a businessman from Maramures imprisoned for fraud regarding the quality of goods and forgery in private signatures. He was also involved in cigarette trafficking.
Former boxer, Mihai Lauruc is close to the Russian Embassy in Romania and participates in its official events. He also participates in a series of public events, such as commemorations of the Red Army, or the visit of Patriarch Kirill of Russia to Bucharest.
Moreover, the deputy of the Ruthenian minority in Romania, Iulius Firczak, reacted on his Facebook page regarding what he called ""an attempt to incite and divide the Ruthenian minority"", legitimately represented in the Romanian Parliament through the Cultural Union of Ruthenians from Romania , and not through the parallel organization of Mihai Lauruc.
Such a theme of the division of Romania on ethnic criteria often appears among the leaders of the AUR party.
Also, the fact that Romania will be drawn into a conflict that is not its own in Ukraine, is one of the themes most ventilated by Russian propaganda in the Romanian media. Veridica.ro dismantled several such articles written to create anxiety among the population by virtue of the fact that Romania would be pushed by the West to participate in a possible war in Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing a state of fear among the Romanian population through apocalyptic scenarios. Undermining confidence in NATO. Presenting Russia as a victim of NATO, not as an aggressor state.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The narrative regarding the risk of Romania's dismemberment refers to the most traumatic period in Romania's modern history, when a significant part of the country's territory was lost (northern Transylvania as a result of the Vienna Dictatorship, northern Bucovina and Bessarabia after the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Quadrilateral, ceded to Bulgaria after being part of Romania for almost 30 years).
However, the circumstances are completely different today. Romania has regulated its relations with all its neighbors for decades and there are no territorial claims against it. Moreover, Romania's territorial integrity is guaranteed by its membership in NATO, which includes two of its neighbors, Hungary and Bulgaria, as allies. The apocalyptic scenario regarding the disappearance of Romania would imply the disappearance of the entire post-Cold War security architecture, the disappearance of NATO or - at least - its withdrawal beyond Eastern Europe and, above all, Russia's ability to impose such a fantasy scenario, under the conditions which is clearly surpassed, economically and militarily, by the Alliance.
NATO has repeatedly conveyed that it has no intention of getting involved militarily in a conflict in Ukraine and that this country, not being a member state, does not benefit from the protection of Article 5, so that the only way in which Romania, as a NATO member, would could be involved in such a war is if it, or another allied country, were attacked by Russia. Moreover, the entire current crisis was triggered as a result of the mobilization of Russia, which threatens with aggression an independent country that it has already attacked; in Eastern Europe, Moscow has been playing this role as an aggressor state ever since the dissolution of the USSR, which, before Russia, had been the great regional aggressor.
Regarding the comparison between NATO and Nazi Germany, NATO is a defensive alliance that does not threaten Russia in any way; on the contrary, Russia is trying to force the hand of the great powers and to negotiate with them the fate of Ukraine and the states of Eastern Europe, following a model reminiscent of the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, which practically divided their states independent from Eastern Europe and together they started the Second World War, before coming into conflict with each other.

NEWS: ""A big deal"", like an exchange of ""geopolitical assets"" between the USA and Russia, has been discussed for a long time.

CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the context of the massing of Russian forces at the border with Ukraine and the warnings of the international community regarding the risk of a large-scale war triggered by Moscow, various analyzes and editorials about the pacifist intentions of the Kremlin were published on the pages of news agencies financed by the Russian government and the ""absurdity"" of Western theses about organizing an invasion against the neighboring state in the future. After the West accused Russia of having concentrated more than 127 thousand soldiers on the borders with Ukraine in order to attack it and especially after the failure of diplomatic consultations in Geneva , Brussels and Vienna, both the Russian press and Russian politicians began to declare that Moscow is not planning to attack. ""If it depends on Russia, there will be no war"" with Ukraine, said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, reacting to the US warning that there is a ""real possibility"" that Russia will invade Ukraine in February.
At the same time, the rhetoric of the Russian government press continues to be hostile, the Ukrainian state being presented as an enemy, dangerous for the existence of Russia. Veridica.ro recently showed how the pro-Kremlin press distributes various false narratives about Nazism in Ukraine and Kiev's intentions to gain territory in the future, with the support of the West, following the weakening of Russia if it loses its geopolitical competition with the USA.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of these narratives is to show Kiev as an aggressor state, controlled by the US, which does not want to respect the Minsk Peace Agreements and which could organize a massacre against Russian speakers at any time.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The accusations regarding Kiev's intentions to start a war against Russia are without any basis, given both Ukraine's limited military capabilities and the lack of any logic or political motivation for such a military adventure. The false narrative about a hypothetical attack by Kiev against Russia was analyzed during a press conference by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who recalled the story of the fox ""who said he had no choice but to attack the chickens because they would represent a threat"".
Veridica has already dismantled a series of fake news about the massacre that the Ukrainian territorial defense units are preparing in Donbass. The press organs of the Russian government and those of the self-proclaimed republics DNR and LNR present the situation in Donbass not as a conflict artificially supported by Moscow to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, but as a genocide organized by Ukraine and the West. These narratives aim to sow fear towards Kiev in order to make the recovery of Donbass and Crimea impossible. The Russian government press does not mention these facts, stating only that Russia will have to defend itself if Ukraine attacks.
The narratives about the unity of the Russian and Ukrainian people are also false, a thesis also mentioned in an article signed by President Vladimir Putin himself and published on the Kremlin website. Arguing the unity of these 2 Slavic peoples, Putin himself publishes the article in Ukrainian, which shows from the start that it is not a single linguistic community. The respective thesis is a journalistic exposition of Russian nationalist Eurasianism, created around the thesis that the Russian world is civilizationally distinct from the rest of the peoples, and the restoration of Great Russia must be a goal of the Kremlin and of Russians everywhere. In order to argue the necessity of Russia's direct intervention in the conflict in Donbass, inappropriate arguments from the field of international law are not used, but ""positive"" data, selected to order, related to the history of the Russian world, are used. Tragic pages are, however, ignored of the past such as the persecutions against Ukrainians during the Russian Empire or the Holodomor organized by the USSR elite against Ukrainians in 1932-1933.
The idea of ​​Ukraine's refusal to respect the Minsk Peace Agreements seems to be devoid of any arguments and evidence. In fact, the author of the article published on Ukraina.ru, admits between the lines and without realizing it, that Russia is the one that will not allow compliance with the peace agreements, writing that Moscow will not accept the return of Donbass to Ukraine (as provide for the agreements) because in this case a massacre will be organized against the Russophones. In reality, according to the Minsk Peace Agreements, Russia must withdraw its weapons and troops from Donbass, following the organization of free elections that will decide the fate of this region. Ukraine claims that it cannot organize these elections in the territories de facto controlled by Russia, and the voting cannot be held under the pressure of the weapons of mercenaries financed by the Kremlin.

In fact, the Transnistrian conflict is one of the major obstacles to future European integration.
NEWS: ""The President of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, stated in an interview for Pro TV that she wants to expedite the evacuation of the Russian contingent of peacekeepers from Transnistria and to resolve the problem related to the military ammunition at the warehouses in Colbasna.
(...)Unfortunately, today such a system of relations is built around Transnistria, that because of the instability in the region, the power from Chisinau gets dividends. For example, speculating on the history with the Russian peacekeepers, NATO and the EU bring weapons, conclude agreements with Chisinau to support the military reform.
This creates a situation where, without the conflict with Tiraspol, Moldova would lose its attractiveness in the eyes of the West, which will automatically lead to a reduction in financial support from the EU and the US to support the governing regime. and this, it is not difficult to understand, is not in the interest of the current government""
NARRATIVES: 1. The government from Chisinau fuels the tensions on the Dniester when it demands the withdrawal of the Russians from Transnistria and risks new military confrontations. 2. Maintaining the Transnistrian conflict is in favor of Chisinau, as it allows it to obtain more support from the EU and NATO.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: In 1990, against the backdrop of the collapse of the USSR, the Transnistrian region, which was part of the Moldavian SSR, self-proclaimed independence, motivating the decision by the ""Romanization"" of Moldova and the ""danger of union with Romania"".
On March 2, 1992, an armed conflict broke out, which officially ended with the signing of the Agreement on the principles of peaceful resolution of the armed conflict in the Transnistrian region by the then presidents of the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation, Mircea Snegur and Boris Eltin. The document provides security measures along the Dniester including the creation of a peacekeeping mission, the demilitarization of the conflict zone and the creation of the Unified Control Commission.
At the same time, Russia also has a military contingent in the region that, officially, guards an ammunition depot that belonged to the Soviet XIV Army, which was involved in the 1992 conflict on the side of Tiraspol. Russia has not fulfilled its international commitments to evacuate troops and ammunition. Currently, all Chisinau's steps regarding the withdrawal of Russian forces from the territory of the Republic of Moldova are commented by Moscow and Tiraspol as attempts to destroy the peacekeeping mission, although they are different issues.
OBJECTIVE: To present the government from Chisinau as belligerent, interested in perpetuating and even escalating the Transnistrian conflict. Indirectly, to present the West (EU, USA, NATO) as being interested in maintaining the current status-quo in order to put pressure on Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: It has already become a tradition for Moscow and Tiraspol to present any move by Chisinau to withdraw troops and military ammunition from the left bank of the Dniester as an attempt to abolish the peacekeeping mission, whose role is glorified and overrated.
In fact, Chisinau demands the fulfillment of the commitments officially assumed by Russia at the OSCE Summit in 1999. The maintenance of its troops in Transnistria represents an important guarantee for the secessionist regime in Tiraspol, for which the only way to settle the conflict would be to recognize the independence of the self-proclaimed republic.
Even in the interview for Pro TV to which the article refers, Maia Sandu talks about the withdrawal of the Russian army, not about the peacekeeping force. ""The presence of Russian troops on the territory of the Republic of Moldova is in contradiction with the constitution and the provision of neutrality of the Republic of Moldova. This topic, the aspect of the withdrawal of Russian troops, is a permanent aspect on the bilateral agenda with the Russian Federation, but it is also a topic that we approach at all international forums in order to obtain support from the international community for the withdrawal of troops from our territory"".
The narrative about the use of the Transnistrian conflict to obtain support from the EU and NATO is a new one, but it does not withstand any criticism. First of all, an unresolved territorial conflict and the presence of foreign military forces on this territory represent a serious impediment to the approach and/or accession of the Republic of Moldova to the EU.
This is also mentioned by Maia Sandu in the respective interview: ""The forces that wanted us to become independent from the Soviet Union tried to stop this process and, unfortunately, the existence of this Transnistrian conflict represents serious impediments in the development of the Republic of Moldova , represent impediments on our European path. Of course, it is an important task for us to find a solution, but this solution must be peaceful, diplomatic, a solution that respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova and the reintegration must result in a functional state. These three elements are extremely important.""
Maintaining the status quo, that is, the Russian military presence a little more than 100 km from its border, is neither in the interest of the EU nor NATO.
In addition, neither the pro-Russian governments in Chisinau - the most recent being that of the socialists - have not found any solution to identify the conflict, so it cannot be said that the pro-Europeans are the ones who maintain it. Publication / Media:

Narratives of this type are intended to associate the West with an external danger and undermines Moldova's European integration efforts.
NEWS: <<,,Demonization"" of Russia is a propaganda method used by the Atlanticist networks with the aim of maintaining its dominance over the collective consciousness, says the analyst and publicist Iurie Rosca in a new edition of his show. ,,... It doesn't even matter how much evil historical Russia or Soviet Russia did in our region, it matters that today's Russia is presented as an absolute evil, a metaphysical evil, the only major problem that Romania or the Republic of Moldova would have. Thus, it is possible to divert the attention of the public opinion in our country from real problems: who colonized our economy? Russia or the collective West? Who culturally devastated our area? Russia or the collective West? Who managed to install himself in all the key functions the respective characters? Anyone who does not fit into the propaganda, political and media apparatus of the Altlantist networks is charged as an agent of influence of the Russian Federation. And you can talk to him a thousand times: sir, I have reached the wooden hoe, and in Romania and the Republic of Moldova we are devastated economically, culturally, socially; we are terrorized with the LGBT agenda, with the great reset agenda, with the plandemic agenda, with injections, with the vaccination passport, with the limitations to be active in the work field. Who is to blame? Putin, Russia, the respective people from Romania or the Republic of Moldova who are uncomfortable? Governing through chaos is a classic method of satanic globalists who want to keep the world in confusion, in order to dominate. Scaring Russia is just a method for neutralizing the uncomfortable, for compromising their speech, for distorting their image, for the purpose of those who want to instill the new world order, including by keeping the public opinion in Romania and the Republic of Moldova in a fog >> NARRATIVES: 1. Russia is demonized so that the West can control the ex-Soviet space. 2. The West devastated Romania and the Republic of Moldova from an economic, social and cultural point of view and imposes its agenda on them. 3. The West imposes the ""LGBT agenda"". 4. The ""Satanist Globalists"" want to keep the world in chaos, in order to dominate it.
CONTEXT: The society in the Republic of Moldova is, since it declared its independence, divided between two major currents - pro-European and pro-Russian. The first is generally represented by the population from the younger generation, with studies, from the urban environment, who travel and work in Europe. Adherents of the pro-Russian, or Eurasian current, are older people, nostalgic for the USSR, from the countryside, but also a part of ethnic Russians, Gagauz, Bulgarians, who are generally Russian speakers.
This state is maintained by the political class, which is also divided between pro-Russians and pro-Europeans. The formations and politicians who position themselves in the pro-Russian zone also take over Moscow's speech, directed against the West and NATO, which, in the opinion of the Kremlin, wants to expand and dominate in the former Soviet republics. This speech intensified with the takeover of power in Chisinau by a pro-European party.
The population of the Republic of Moldova, which also speaks Russian, remained in the informational space of the Russian Federation even after the separation from the USSR in 1991. The official channels from Russia continued to be broadcast in Chisinau, and over time their number increased, which -consolidated the dominance over the media market in the Republic of Moldova. Thus, the official position of the Kremlin and the dominant message from Moscow are propagated without any restrictions in the Republic of Moldova.
Iurie Rosca is one of the most famous politicians from the Republic of Moldova. Initially, he led the Popular Christian Democratic Front/Party from the Republic of Moldova, a political formation that was born within the democratic movement of 1988-89, which openly confronted the communist nomenclature, a party with democratic, pro-Romanian and pro-Western visions. Starting with the second term of president of the communist Vladimir Vornin, Rosca moved further and further away from the current with which he had previously been associated. He was accused in Chisinau of betraying the national movement. Even before that radical change in his options, in certain circles in Chisinau there were suspicions regarding the real intentions of Iurie Rosca, these being expressed, for example, by one of the exponents of the national movement, Gheorghe Ghimpu (see Stindardul sfintei libertati, Prut International publishing house, 2010).
Currently, Iurie Rosca positions himself as a follower of traditionalism and anti-globalism, as well as of the Eurasianist ideology promoted by his friend, Alexandr Dughin, an ideologue of the Kremlin. At the same time, Iurie Rosca regularly takes over the discourse of the radical right in the West. During the pandemic, he promoted anti-Covid, anti-mask and anti-vaccine messages. Iurie Rosca is also a promoter of conspiracy theories.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to associate the West and European integration efforts in the Republic of Moldova with the idea of ​​an external danger, meant to destroy society.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Russia has failed to build trusting relationships based on the principle of equality and mutual respect with the former Soviet republics. On the contrary, Moscow provoked armed conflicts and continues to support separatist regimes in the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia, refuses to withdraw its troops stationed illegally on the territories of these countries. Also, the Kremlin acted through energy and economic blackmail to keep these countries in its sphere of influence. After the occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and the start of the war in Donbas, in 2014, Russia has now massed numerous troops and military weapons on the border with Ukraine, threatening a large-scale war. The leader from the Kremlin asks NATO not to admit former Soviet republics into the Alliance, which also goes against the statute of the organization and the sovereignty of these peoples. The Baltic, former Soviet republics, or countries that were part of the socialist camp and that are currently part of the European Union, have a much higher standard of living of the population than in the other states of the former USSR. Romania had, only since it was admitted to the EU, a surplus of 44 billion dollars from it, and from the point of view of economic growth in the period 2000 - 2020 (which includes the years in the EU and NATO and those in which the most intense reforms were made with a view to accession), it ranked 5th in the world, currently negotiating its entry into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Republic of Moldova, although it is not a member of the EU, benefited from substantial support from it, and the benefits increased with the signing of the Association Agreement, despite the disinformation that tried to prove that it would be harmful for Moldova.
The narrative regarding a so-called ""LGBT agenda"" is one of the favorite themes of Russian propaganda and of the extreme right, used persistently over time. Veridica has dismantled numerous fake news on this topic, see for example here, here and here .
The narrative with the ""globalist Satanists"" is a reference to a lot of conspiracy theories (Q-Anon is a recent one); the instability is promoted, in fact, also by Russia through its constant disinformation campaigns and attempts to destabilize the West. Publication / Media:

The narrative is promoted by activenews, a site with a pronounced anti-vaccine and corona-skeptic editorial policy.
NEWS: Simona Halep had visible and audible health problems during Monday's match with Alize Cornet, in the round of 16 of the Australian Open 2022, which she lost to the French player, according to Eurosport and Antena Sport. [...]
At one point, she said she could no longer breathe. Several vaccinated players from the Australian Open complained about the same problem, however, blaming it on ""poor air quality"". [...]
In an exclusive interview for Eurosport, the Romanian declared that she did not feel well, had dizziness, stomach and liver pain. One of the causes identified by Halep for these health problems would be ... ""excessive heat"" [...]
Not long ago, it gave lessons through the media to the tennis player Novak Djokovic, who had air even in a warm country like Australia, but did not have the Covid vaccine and was not allowed to participate in the Australian Open 2022 by the same authorities who had approved his medical exemption, in order to then walk him between the indictment at the airport, the penitentiary hotel and the courts as an example of ""not like that"" for the people in the Australian camp.
NOLE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE LOST BY NOT GETTING VACCINATED LIKE SIMO!
Asked if she thinks that Novak Djokovic should have played since the Australian Open, Halep answered cynically, with a total lack of inter-sports solidarity:
""I have always been pro-vaccine. I got vaccinated when I had to, from the beginning. I always listened to the opinion of doctors and specialists. I totally agree with them.""
Now, she makes collegial statements against the French player who defeated her due to physical incapacity, a few months after dose 3. That's how it is in tennis!"" NARRATIVES: 1. Simona Halep had health problems and was eliminated from the Australian Open because she got vaccinated. 2. While the vaccinated players encountered health problems, Novak Djokovic, unvaccinated, felt perfect.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The coronavirus pandemic was marked by an intense misinformation campaign that targeted, among other things, the origin and nature of SARS-CoV-2, the measures taken to stop the spread of Covid-19, the effectiveness of anti-Covid vaccines. The main sources of this global campaign were - and continue to be - Russia, China and the extreme right in the West. The narratives that come from these sources have been intensively distributed and their spread suggests that, in many cases, those who amplified them do not even have any connection with the primary sources, entering the category of so-called ""useful idiots"".
The global anti-vaccine movement stood in solidarity with Novak Djokovic when the player, who until now refused to get vaccinated, was prevented from staying in Australia to participate in the Melbourne Open. As usual in such situations, a series of false narratives were built and thrown on the market. Most of the players participating in the Australian Open had been vaccinated against Covid. This was one of the conditions for entering Australia, but the vaccination of players was not a phenomenon that appeared even before the Australian Open; many players have been vaccinated before and have participated in vaccinated tournaments, without complaining that their performances were affected in any way by the serum.
In Romania, one of the supposedly corona-skeptic and anti-vaccine publications is activenews. Veridica has repeatedly dismantled fake news and disinformation promoted by activenews regarding the alleged adverse effects of anti-covid vaccines.
Articles that suggest - or explicitly state - that the anti-Covid vaccination would have led to the death of some people appear regularly on activenews: only in the first three days of the week in which Simona Haelp was written about, articles appeared suggesting that the anti- covid would be responsible for the deaths of the Bessarabian journalist Valeriu Vulcan, the former Hungarian gymnast Szilveszter Csollany and the American actor Vachik Mangassarian.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining and discrediting the anti-Covid vaccination campaign.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The symptoms described by Simona Halep during the Australian Open round of 16 match are common in the case of heat exhaustion, and even the player stated that she was affected by the high temperature. By the way, Simona Halep also encountered heat-related problems in the past, also at the Australian Open. After the final she played in 2018 (two years before the appearance of the coronavirus and, therefore, the vaccination), when she was in better shape, she had to be hospitalized and it took her months to to recover completely. In addition, out of 11 previous participations at the Australian Open, the player went to a stage more advanced than the eighths 5 times, and in another 5 times she was eliminated before reaching this stage.
Simona Halep does not even represent a singular case. In 2009, even Novak Djokovic abandoned his quarter-final match against Andy Roddick due to heat exhaustion. The problem of excessive heat at the Australian Open and the impact it has on the players is an old one and was previously denounced, especially after the 2014 tournament, when many players were affected by the heat wave. Moreover, the Melbourne Open is by no means the only tennis tournament in which players had health problems due to high temperatures.
As for the supposedly better tolerance of the unvaccinated Novak Djokovic to the heat at this year's Australian Open, the Serb hasn't even played in the tournament, so he hasn't faced the same pressure as players who have put in competitive efforts top In addition, players' tolerance to physical exertion and high temperatures are different, depending on a multitude of factors such as the existence of some diseases, physical training, body, hydration, etc. Every match at the Australian Open ended with the victory of one player and the defeat of another (both being vaccinated). Simona Halep managed to reach a relatively advanced stage of the tournament after some victories in which she played and resisted better.

In fact, NATO is strengthening its eastern flank in response to Russian threats, and the forces sent by the Alliance represent a fraction of the more than 100,000 soldiers mobilized by Moscow.
NEWS: ""NATO has announced that it is sending more ships and planes to Eastern Europe while presenting itself as a defensive alliance, although no one has threatened any NATO state. NATO made an important announcement on Monday, namely that NATO Allies are putting their forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter planes to NATO deployment sites in Eastern Europe, strengthening the Allies' deterrence and defense. The reason cited by NATO would be that Russia ""continues its military consolidation in and around Ukraine"" [...] ""I welcome the fact that the allies are contributing additional forces to NATO. NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies, including by strengthening the eastern part of the Alliance. We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including by strengthening our collective defense,"" Stoltenberg said [...] Their presence makes it clear that an attack on an ally will be considered an attack on the entire Alliance. There were no forces NATO in the eastern part of the Alliance before 2014"", the press release also states. A deployment of forces that is not justified since no NATO member was threatened!"".
NARRATIVE: NATO is an offensive and aggressive alliance that is preparing for war, although no one has threatened any of its members.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The worsening of the security climate around Ukraine's borders, starting in 2014, when Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and supported the separatists who started the war in Donbass, inevitably led to an increase in the level of alert among NATO member states , especially since Russia has also intensified its activities in the Baltic and Black Sea areas. It should not be forgotten, in the context, that before the attack on Ukraine, Russia started a cyber war with Estonia and a conventional one with Georgia, a country which, like Ukraine, has Euro-Atlantic aspirations.
In particular, the countries on the Eastern flank of the Alliance increased their military capabilities against the backdrop of Moscow's increased militaristic attitude, as well as direct threats from Russian officials. At the same time, these ex-communist or ex-Soviet states, which also have the historical experience of Moscow's aggressiveness, have repeatedly requested the strengthening of the Alliance's presence on their territory.
In the last year, Russia has shown dissuasive aggression, by carrying out dozens of maneuvers and combat exercises around the borders of Ukraine. Currently, more than 100,000 Russian soldiers are mobilized, as well as heavy combat equipment.
In addition to the deployment on the ground, the Russian Federation presented a list of demands to the USA on December 17. Among Moscow's demands is the withdrawal of American bases from Eastern Europe. Moreover, last Friday, Russia explicitly mentioned Romania and Bulgaria, NATO member states for about 18 years, as countries from which the Alliance should withdraw its forces.
Despite the fact that it deploys impressive contingents of troops on the ground, ready to invade Ukraine, Moscow tries to victimize itself and promotes the false narrative that it would be the target of a NATO aggression.
This attempt at victimization is also reported by the US State Department, which recently published a list of Russian narratives.
""Russian government officials falsely portray Russia as a perpetual victim and its aggressive actions as a forced response to the alleged actions of the United States and our democratic allies and partners. In order to promote these statements, Russia uses one of its favorite labels to try to answer: ""Russophobia"", states the press release of the American diplomacy, quoted by G4Media.ro.
As far as Romania is concerned, one of the constant threats from Russia was related to the location of the anti-missile shield in Deveselu. Since then, several Russian officials have stated that Romania will become the target of Russian missiles, even though the anti-missile system in Romania uses SM-3 type missiles, without an explosive charge and which only use kinetic force. Russia claims, however, that they can be replaced at any time with attack missiles.
OBJECTIVE: Presenting NATO as an aggressive military alliance that arms itself unjustifiably. Inventing a justification for Russia's aggressive policy, presented here as a defensive one. Shifting attention from the mobilization of Russian forces near the borders of Ukraine.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: NATO is a defensive alliance by its statute, meant to protect the member states and respond to an attack on them. It is the sovereign right of any state to accept foreign forces on its territory and it is the right of NATO to place its forces wherever it wants, with the agreement of the states that host them. The consolidation of the eastern flank is the result of Russia's aggression in the region, being only a simple preventive reaction. A recent example was given by the head of Romanian diplomacy, Bogdan Aurescu, who declared that NATO's eastern flank must be strengthened as soon as possible after Russia nominated Romania as the country from which NATO should withdraw. Moreover, even the claims presented to the West in the context of the crisis in Ukraine represent a form of violation of the sovereignty of the member states accepted in NATO after 1997.
Moreover, Russia has previously threatened NATO states on the eastern flank. In addition, the Russian forces are clearly superior to those of the NATO states on the eastern flank, and the international troops of the Alliance sent to the respective states are not of a nature to threaten Russia, their role being one of deterrence. The alliance currently has four multinational battalions, i.e. approximately four thousand soldiers, in Poland and the Baltic states. To these are added much smaller units and some reduced contingents of the United States, and in response to the strong mobilization of Russia, President Joe Biden is considering supplementing the American forces in the region by 8,500 soldiers.
TRUTH: The USA, France, Holland and Spain have already announced their intention to send additional troops and combat equipment to Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic countries. Publication / Media:

The United Kingdom is one of the NATO states that, in the context of the danger of a Russian invasion, offered Ukraine lethal equipment to be able to defend itself.
NEWS: ,,According to the data of the Center for the Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, London delivers to Kiev Javelin anti-tank systems (which, among others, were also offered by the USA) and NLAW anti-tank missiles. The latter are less powerful than the Javelin and have been with the British Army since 2009. Britain no longer needs them, experts believe. The operating period of these rockets expires. Therefore, sending these weapons to Ukraine is rather a method of getting rid of them.
[...] Until then, the British stole 2 billion from the Ukrainian budget, selling the Ukrainians ships that they do not need.
[...] The US Javelin systems, praised by the Ukrainian authorities, could not even hit an old Soviet tank. British weapons are supplied under the pretext of military cooperation between London and Kiev. In fact, Ukraine is turning into a training ground for the West"".
NARRATIVES: 1. The armament offered to Ukraine by Great Britain has expired. 2. Ukraine received equipment from the West that was technically outdated, unable to do the job for which it was designed. 3. The Ukrainians receive, at exorbitant prices, useless warships that no one needs anymore.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the middle of January this year. Great Britain has started sending anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in the context of the tensions created by the massing of Russian troops near the border. The British Minister of Defense, Ben Wallace, gave assurances that it is a defensive weapon. A small number of personnel arrived in Ukraine to provide training for the Ukrainian military for a short period of time. According to the British side, if Ukraine is invaded with Russian tanks, these systems will be part of the defense mechanism. Kiev requested this help from Great Britain, considering that Russia has over 3,000 tanks on the border with Ukraine, and the frozen ground from January-February would allow an armored invasion.
After the West accused Russia of having concentrated more than 127 thousand soldiers on the borders with Ukraine in order to attack it, and especially after the failure of the diplomatic consultations in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna, more and more NATO member states sent military or non-military aid. military of Kiev. However, most of these aids have become the target of disinformation narratives from Russia.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of these narratives is to discredit the West's initiatives to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine and to sow fear in Ukrainian society regarding Kiev's inability to defend itself.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In reality, the NLAW anti-tank missiles have a service life of 20 years, according to the manufacturer's website. In other words, if the NLAW is equipped with the British army since 2009, the oldest weapons will work for another 7 years, although it is not really known from which year of manufacture the missiles offered to Kiev by the partners in London (2009 or a more recent year!). Therefore, the conclusions of the experts cited, but not named by the pro-Kremlin press, are false. NLAW missiles will be able to be used by the Ukrainian army until at least 2029.
It is also not true that the Javelin systems cannot ""hit even an old Soviet tank"". The Javelin system of portable anti-tank missiles is one of the most efficient in the world, it has been successfully used over 5000 times in conditions of combat, it has high accuracy, it is easy to use by infantrymen. The system was developed towards the end of the Cold War to be used against Soviet tanks and the kind of equipment that currently exists in the equipment of the Russian army, that is why it is a reason of concern to Moscow. After obtaining the Javelin man-portable anti-tank missile systems from the US, the Ukrainian military used this weapon in an exercise in the area of ​​responsibility of Operation United Forces Ukraine. In December 2021, the Ukrainian military was tasked with striking a the target - represented by a tank hidden in a trench - at a distance of approximately 1.5 km. ""Despite the fact that the soldiers fired this weapon for the first time, the task was successfully completed - the target was hit"" , it is shown in the press release.
According to the narrative of the Russian government media, ""the British stole 2 billion from the Ukrainian budget, selling the Ukrainians ships that they do not need"". It is a project to strengthen the Ukrainian Naval Forces, in which the United States, not the United Kingdom, participates. Two Island-class patrol boats arrived in the Ukrainian port of Odessa in November 2021. Ukraine received two similar ships in 2019. The patrol boats are part of a security package for Ukraine worth over 2.5 billion dollars. The US State Department also approved in 2021 the potential sale to Ukraine of up to 16 Mark VI patrol ships and military equipment worth about 600 million dollars. Ukraine needs these and many other ships in The Black Sea, after, following the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia, was practically left without a fleet. The consolidation of the Ukrainian Maritime Forces is not seen well in Moscow, which promotes false narratives about Ukraine as an experimental training ground for the West through the press that finances it. The pro-Kremlin media does not mention anything about the annexation of Crimea, condemned by the international community, or about Russia's funding and fueling of the conflict in Donbass, resulting in over 13 thousand victims - facts hidden from the Russian-speaking reader or viewer that show that Russia has transformed Ukraine in a real polygon.

In fact, it is only about the periodic renewal of the Action Plan with NATO, which has nothing to do with neutrality or joining the Alliance.
NEWS: ""The Government of the Republic of Moldova approved the new Individual Action Plan of the partnership with NATO for the years 2022-2023 [...]
The plan provides, ""Consolidation of democratic control over the military forces of the Republic of Moldova, cooperation in the modernization and development of the capabilities of the armed forces of the Republic of Moldova, cooperation in combating new threats to security, preventing cyber attacks, terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.""
In this way, Moldova leaves its military forces under the control of the North Atlantic Alliance, which, with the opening of the NATO Information and Documentation Center in Chisinau (actually the NATO Liaison Office. The Information and Documentation Center is a non-governmental institution that has been operating since 2007 n.red) has access to all information, including military information.
The adoption of this plan, which unequivocally indicates the renunciation of the Republic of Moldova's status of neutrality, coincided in time with a series of actions to destabilize Moldovan-Russian relations""
NARRATIVES: 1. NATO takes control of the army and defense system of the Republic of Moldova. 2. The government in Chisinau is ready to force the accession of the Republic of Moldova to NATO.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The collaboration of the Republic of Moldova with NATO started back in the 90s, and one of the most important projects of NATO was the evacuation of important quantities of pesticides, left over from the Soviet era and which represented a danger for environmental pollution and poisoning soil and water.
However, the North Atlantic Alliance is still presented as a scarecrow for a good part of the population of the Republic of Moldova, who sees it through the prism of Soviet propaganda and, more recently, of the Russian Federation.
Pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau frequently invoke a so-called risk of the Republic of Moldova joining NATO or the opening of military bases of the Alliance on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, although such intentions have never been expressed at an official level.
The Republic of Moldova is a neutral state, according to its Constitution. Some right-wing politicians advocated abandoning this status, but such a measure would only be supported by 20-25% of the population, who would vote for joining NATO, according to polls.
In 2006, during the communist government, the Republic of Moldova signed an Individual Action Plan with NATO, which is periodically updated. The Chisinau government approved the action plan for the years 2022-2023 in its meeting on Wednesday.
Misinformation about NATO's alleged activities in the Republic of Moldova, the construction of military bases, or even possible accession to NATO appear periodically in the Russian and Russian-language media from the Republic of Moldova, being fueled by the statements or allusions of some left-wing politicians. Now, however, such articles are intended to incite even more spirits against the background of the crisis in Ukraine, Moscow's requests regarding the withdrawal of NATO from Eastern Europe, and the Russian disinformation campaign regarding the alleged aggressive intentions of the North Atlantic Alliance.
It should also be noted that the Republic of Moldova has one of the smallest military budgets in the world, there is a frozen conflict on its territory, in Transnistria, and a Russian military contingent is also stationed there, which, officially, guards an ammunition depot from the Soviet era. It is very unlikely that NATO would want in its ranks a state in conflict which, on top of that, has Russian forces on its territory.
OBJECTIVE: To present the government from Chisinau as a follower of the surrender of the army (and national interests) to the North Atlantic Alliance and of joining this organization (an unpopular idea in the Republic of Moldova). To confirm Moscow's claims about the danger of NATO expansion in Eastern Europe.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The relations of the Republic of Moldova with NATO are based on the realization of a joint Action Plan, periodically renewed, starting with the year 2006. This Action Plan does not foresee either the accession of the Republic of Moldova to NATO or the renunciation of the status of neutrality, provided in the Constitution adopted in 1994.
""The cooperation of the Republic of Moldova with NATO is based on respect for the constitutional neutrality of the state. Under the conditions of its status of neutrality, the Republic of Moldova, by implementing the IPAP, does not pursue the objective of joining the North Atlantic Alliance. The Moldovan authorities propose to implement IPAP for the advancement of the process of reforming and modernizing the security and national defense sector in accordance with the new developments and requirements of the current security environment, for the development of the necessary capacities to face the new challenges, strengthening the security of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova and the state. At the same time, the Republic of Moldova is determined to develop cooperation with NATO member states and partners in combating new common threats to security such as terrorism, cyber threats, which no longer recognize national borders and have an increasingly varied and complex character, and to contributes to the promotion of stability and security in the region and on the European continent"", according to the document adopted by the Government on January 19.
Moreover, in the context in which misinformation often appears regarding the relations of the Republic of Moldova with NATO, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration, Nicu Popescu, stated at the meeting where the extension of the Plan was adopted that the actions and cooperation within this document, they do not affect the principle of state neutrality and are in full compliance with the status of a neutral country"". He also pointed out that the new Plan does not draw new goals or directions for collaboration, being comparable to those adopted previously, and the Republic of Moldova ""retains its right sovereign over any decision related to its security and defense"".
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The Chisinau government approved the action plan for the years 2022-2023 in its meeting on Wednesday, something that happens regularly, after the signing of the first individual action plan in 2006.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: The Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration, Nicu Popescu, stated at the Government meeting, in order to remove speculations, that the new Plan does not provide for new activities, compared to the previous ones, does not pay attention to the neutrality status of the Republic of Moldova and does not provide obligations or commitments towards NATO related to Chisinau's decisions in matters of defense and security.

This opinion was expressed by the Israeli statesman, diplomat, military-political expert, former head of the Israeli ""Native"" Intelligence Service, Yakov Kedmi, in an exclusive interview with the ""Main Topic"" show with Nina Dimoglo on the YouTube channel, Sputnik Moldova, reports Noi.md.
""The corruption of the representatives of the Moldovan political elites and their generally lower political and cultural level are leading the republic down. And these qualities make it very difficult to create a truly strong, independent state. This is quite problematic based on the thirty years of experience. And then the neighboring states, first of all Romania, should accept the principle that Moldova is an independent state. Romania formally accepts this, but in fact it does not consider Moldova an independent state, and Moldovans - a people that differs of Romanians. Thus, one of the constant threats to the Moldovan statehood is Romania, which does not want to accept the Republic of Moldova as an independent state"", the expert mentioned.
At the same time, Yakov Kedmi drew attention to the fact that Romania today is a much less successful state in all fields, both economically and politically, than it was a few years ago. ""Romania's economy does not strengthen the Romanian state. And if, as a result of the negotiations between Russia and the United States or Russia's actions, the American military bases will leave Romania, then this will also weaken the Romanian leadership, and those who have always tried to convince the Romanian people that the presence of American military bases and NATO troops on the territory of Romania only strengthens this state. If the Americans leave Romania and especially if they leave ashamed as a result of Russia's actions of force, this will weaken Romania even more, as well as the pro-Romanian attitude around Romania, including Moldova. Russia, during the negotiations with the United States, demanded the withdrawal of the American military bases from Romania,"" said the military-political expert, the former head of the Israeli Intelligence Service ""Nativ"". NARRATIVES: 1. Romania is a constant threat to Moldovan statehood and does not want to accept Moldova as an independent state; 2. The Moldovans are a separate people from the Romanian nation; 3. Romania is a poorly developed economic state and will weaken even more with the departure of the Americans; 4. The American military bases will leave Romania as a result of the negotiations between Russia and the USA.
CONTEXT: Discussions about the union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania existed all the time after the declaration of independence from the USSR, in 1991, in the context in which this territory is inhabited by ethnic Romanians and was part of medieval Moldova, then of Greater Romania. The restructuring of the USSR, initiated by Gorbachev in the mid-1980s, culminated in most of the Soviet republics primarily with national demands, which were repressed during the USSR. The territory of the Republic of Moldova was annexed in 1940 by the USSR, being separated from Romania following the secret agreements between Hitler and Stalin, the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. The rediscovery of a national, Romanian identity, on the left side of the Dniester (and this assumed only by a part of the population) was not doubled by a significant support for political formations that, explicitly or implicitly, supported the idea of ​​union with Romania; the unionist parties did not even manage to exceed, in the last elections, the threshold necessary for entering the Parliament.
On the other hand, Romania is one of the main advocates of the European integration of the Republic of Moldova, and pro-European parties have had somewhat more political success; practically, starting with 2009, the political scene was dominated, for the most part of the time, by formations with a pro-European discourse, which, however, was not doubled all the time by pro-European policies or respect for EU values. Even before that moment, steps were taken to get closer to the EU, including during the communist rule.
Romania not only lobbied for the Republic of Moldova, but also offered it direct support which, cumulatively, is substantial and, through the policy of returning citizens, practically transported hundreds of thousands of Moldovan citizens to become European citizens. Their direct exposure to Western societies, the direct contact of many with Romania, which allowed them to see what are the advantages of European integration and how this can lead to a substantial economic growth but also to the reform of the state (which, with all the setbacks recorded in time, it advanced much more than on the left of the Dniester, etc.), led to the strengthening of the pro-European current and was one of the factors that contributed to the seizure of power in Chisinau by pro-European reformist forces.
The response of the Russian propaganda and the pro-Kremlin political forces in the Republic of Moldova to the current of national revival in the 90s was the revival of the Soviet theses regarding the existence of two peoples, Moldovan and Romanian, the latter being an aggressor who illegally occupied the territory of Moldova first in 1918, then again with the Nazi forces, the Romanians being ""fascists"" or their descendants.
Similarly, the response to the growth of the pro-European current was the appeal to the world vision in terms of geopolitics and the expansionism of the states; in order to undermine the efforts to get closer to the West, the support offered by it and Romania was presented as part of a plan to seize the Republic of Moldova and even to abolish it.
The narratives about Romania are revived in the context of the tensions in the region and the Kremlin's claims to the USA and NATO. The Republic of Moldova is close to Ukraine, at whose border many Russian military troops are currently stationed, the Kremlin threatening to invade this country again. Against this background, Russia demands security guarantees addressed to the United States and NATO not to expand to the East, especially in Ukraine, and to withdraw its military infrastructure from the countries on the Eastern flank of the Alliance - and in this sense it has nominated Romania and Bulgaria .
The Republic of Moldova has non-natural status, even if it has Russian troops stationed illegally on its territory, but Ukraine and Georgia want to join NATO after being attacked by Russia in 2008 and 2014. Romania joined NATO in 2004.
Yakov Kedmi is presented as the former head of the Israeli National Intelligence Service. Nativ is, in fact, an organization of the Israeli state responsible for relations with Jews from the Soviet Union and the countries of the Eastern bloc and for coordinating their repatriation to Israel. Yakov Kedmi, born Iakov Kazakov, in Moscow in 1947, repatriated to Israel in 1969 and actually led Nativ at one point. In recent years, he participates as a political scientist on Russian television and radio stations, which promote Kremlin policy, being quoted by Russian propaganda.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to present Romania as a state with territorial claims on the Republic of Moldova. At the same time, attempts are being made to undermine the Romanian identity of the majority population in the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Romania was the first state to recognize the independence of the Republic of Moldova, immediately after the proclamation in 1991, and Bucharest's official position has always been to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. No party in power in Romania has issued any territorial claim on the Republic of Moldova. On the contrary, through the Strategic Partnership Romania - Republic of Moldova, Bucharest supports economic and social cooperation and concrete major infrastructure projects and projects at the level of local communities.
On the other hand, Russia, which started and supported a war in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, in 1992, continues to support the separatist regime in Tiraspol and illegally keep its troops in the Dniester, despite the protests of Chisinau and the community international and in spite of the commitments it assumed in this regard.
Romania assumed the Euro-Atlantic integration in the mid-1990s, succeeding that, after the adoption of substantial reforms, it was admitted to both NATO and the EU. The pre-accession reforms and especially the benefits of belonging to the two organizations led to one of the most solid economic growths in the world in the first two decades of the 21st century, a significant reduction in the difference compared to the Western states and a considerable advance compared to the former states -Soviet women who kept pace after the collapse of the USSR. Romania's economy does not depend on the NATO bases stationed on its territory and the impact of a possible withdrawal of them could only be seen in terms of a decrease in the confidence of some investors - but even here it is debatable, given that from an economic point of view Romania it is anchored in the common European market and its economic relations are predominantly with it.
A withdrawal of NATO from Romania is extremely unlikely and in no case could it take place because Russia demands it, since such an act would practically imply the de facto disappearance of the Alliance - it would mean that it succumbs to the aggression of a foreign power , which is against its reason for being. Moreover, no official of the Alliance has made any statement suggesting that the option of a withdrawal would even be taken into account even at a hypothetical level.

The false narrative is promoted in anti-vaccinist and corona-skeptic environments and is linked of the oldest conspiracy theories regarding documents with biometric data.
NEWS: ,,[...]Covid has become a desired trauma, which is passed over with concern, but which, at the end, gives you the soothing feeling of catharsis. Omicron is a fixed pen, nothing. A cold.

Basically, people have become a piece that the demented people of this world move and lead towards what they want: social credit will put you in the condition of slaves, on the Asian model. So don't clear, with your own will, a road that leads into the abyss of a perfect tyrants. (This is also valid for those who bite by.)"". NARRATIVES: 1. Through the QR code on the certificates regarding vaccination or passing through the disease, a step is taken towards social credit. 2. The Covid-19 statistics are published to panic the population. 3. The anti-pandemic measures are intended to terrorize the population. 4. Surgical masks affect physical and mental health.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHICS: Romania is exposed, since the beginning of the pandemic, to a virulent campaign against the measures taken to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, regardless of what their nature was - lockdown, surgical masks, social distancing, vaccination, conditioning access to some spaces for the presentation of certificates regarding vaccination or passing through the disease. The campaign, which also targets the nature of the coronavirus or Covid-19, their origin and virulence, is based on a number of false narratives, most of them common either with false narratives that have Russia and China as their sources, or with those promoted by the radical right in the States United.
Among those who promote or propagate false narratives regarding SARS-CoV-2 are followers of various conspiracy theories, people who emphasize a radical orthodoxy and support those prelates who also contested the anti-Covid measures (the exponent who the most important of them being the archbishop of Tomis, Teodosie), representatives of the Coalition for the Family, sovereignists, Euro-skeptics, anti-Westerners, followers of protochronism, people who over time promoted Russia's messages in Romania and/or were promoted intensively by the spokeswoman of the Kremlin, Sputnik. Iulian Capsali, the author of the article on activenews, is such a character. From the denial of COVID-19, to the intolerant rhetoric under the pretext of patriotism, Capsali is one of the exponents of the anti-vaccination movement in Romania and a fervent promoter of conspiracy theories related to this virus.
Even though he has already contracted COVID-19 twice, Capsali continues to claim that this disease is just a simple cold, although he publicly admitted that it took him 13 days to recover the last time he contracted the disease.
Activenews is one of the most active online publications in denouncing the official line regarding Covid and promoting false narratives regarding it; many of the narratives are taken from the area of ​​American law (sometimes by translating and republishing some articles).
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the trust of the population in the medical system and in the country's political leaders. Combating anti-pandemic measures. Promoting conspiracy theories.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Conspiracy theories regarding the use of technology to subjugate and monitor the population are not new. Long before the outbreak of the Covid pandemic, Muslim extremists in Pakistan and Afghanistan launched attacks against medical teams carrying out vaccination campaigns (for example against poliomyelitis), because they feared that in this way they would be followed by the CIA.. More Lately, there have been conspiracies regarding 5G technology, which would also involve the implantation of chips. There were also conspiracy theories (also promoted in the Orthodox area in countries such as Romania, Russia, the Republic of Moldova, etc.) regarding passports and biometric identity cards, which would be a tool of the Devil.
Conspiracy theories related to the QR code belong to the family of those who emphasize technology and take elements from them - in Australia, for example, a false narrative has gone viral according to which such codes would be injected with the help of the vaccine. Also in Australia, a series of applications have appeared that deceive the reading of green certificates, also for fear of government control; in fact, the authorities did not introduce a population monitoring system but contact tracking applications (also used in other countries) to be able to quickly locate and isolate outbreaks of Covid-19.
Another conspiracy theory related to QR is that it will be used to implement a social credit system similar to the Chinese one, which involves monitoring the behavior of individuals and companies; facilitating or hindering access to certain facilities, obtaining bank loans, even some rights (to obtain a passport and to travel) would depend on these social credits. Such a conspiracy theory was launched, for example, in Canada in 2021, where the source seems to be a notification to Canadian companies that want to operate in China that they must also take into account the social credit system in that country.
The narrative promoted by Iulian Capsali only takes elements from the above theories. In addition, numerous materials have been published on activenews regarding the alleged dangers of the QR code.
Such narratives are false because the certificates on which the QR code appears are strictly used to combat the pandemic, even when it comes to contact tracking. The problem of social credit is specific to China, a dictatorial communist state that tries to exercise strict control over its own population, and there is no question of extending this system to democratic societies.
In Romania, the QR code on the certificates attesting to vaccination or passing through the disease only verifies their authenticity, validity and integrity, and the data is only read, not recorded.
Regarding the publication of statistics, this aspect is related to institutional transparency, not to any plan to panic the population. The more informed she is about the dangers of the coronavirus pandemic, the more likely she is to take measures to protect herself. Correctly informing the population is vital given the low vaccination rate, resistance to anti-pandemic measures and the intense misinformation campaign. Almost 60 thousand Romanians were killed by Covid and almost two million were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and some of these cases could have been avoided if protective measures had been taken. The implicit proposal that the statistics should no longer be published is a plea for censorship and even for disinformation. The anti-pandemic measures are intended to protect the population, not to terrorize it, and represent sanitary policies, not oppressive policies. The suspension of classes after the registration of a number of cases is also intended to protect the children.
Finally, the false narratives regarding the ""dangers of the mask"" have been dismantled repeatedly, since the beginning of the pandemic. Publication / Media:

The offer would have been made based on the theses of ""Clash of Civilizations"", a work that appeared a few years later.
NEWS: ""Also at the beginning of the 1990s it can be said that the USA came with a counter-offer, which can be appreciated as generous only to the extent that we relate it to an act of capitulation by Moscow, in reality existing only in Washington's imagination . What was proposed was the return to the sphere of influence of tsarist Russia until the outbreak of the First World War. This implied a new demarcation line between the Catholic and Protestant Western Europe, on the one hand, and the Eastern European Orthodox, on the other. The one who conceived the doctrinal support of the project was Samuel Huntington (through the study later developed in his book ""The Clash of Civilizations""). According to him, the border between the two spheres was to be the line of the Carpathian mountains. As a consequence, Romania would be dismembered, Transylvania being allocated to the Euro-Atlantic block and the Old Kingdom to the Euro-Asian one, i.e. to the USA / Germany and Russia respectively. How the division of Romania did not succeed (and this is due to those who were in charge of the country in the year of the ""great attempts "", 1990), it remained for it to be allocated entirely to Russia. And does anyone still have the audacity to criticize the revival of spheres of influence today?! [...] The demonizing speech practiced by the USA and its ventriloquists from the NATO general secretariat towards Russia, to the extent that it is sterile, i.e. it is not followed by a concrete action, remaining only to fill the expectation of the Kremlin's future move on the drawing board chess of the world, can be qualified as an alibi for the lack of political vision, of any policy. If it is a negotiation tactic, intended to intimidate the preopinent, this becomes an adventure when the real dialogue is postponed due to the lack of a clear conception of the pursued strategic target. In the past, Nazi Germany unleashed a furious campaign to demonize those who would be its victims, before attacking them militarily [...] The support given on the ground to the ""orange revolution"" in Ukraine in 2004, with reminder ten years later, it is already well documented and irrefutable. There is no longer any secret about those who sent tents, beds, cans, medical equipment, as well as somewhat blunter equipment, and even counselors, to Maidan Square in the support of the ""democratic forces"" who demanded a ""peaceful"" change of political regime. NARRATIVES: 1. Romania kept its territorial integrity after 1990 thanks to Russia. 2. The USA behaves like Nazi Germany and conducts campaigns to demonize Russia. 3. The Euromaidan in Kiev in 2013 was an ""orange revolution"" organized by the West.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The negotiations in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna from the week of January 10-15 between the West and Russia did not produce the effects expected by Moscow, the Russians put on the table of the West a series of demands that rather belong to a mentality of dividing the spheres of influence during the Cold War. Moreover, the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, considers the dismemberment of the USSR and the loss of Russia's influence as a world power as the greatest ""geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century"".
During the negotiations, Russia demanded, among other things, the elimination of the military presence of NATO and the USA from the eastern flank and the blocking of the expansion of the Alliance to the East - more precisely, the blocking of the reception of Ukraine and Georgia in its ranks.
Russia's requests were made public after Moscow deployed more than 100,000 troops to the border with Ukraine, and Kiev and Western countries expressed concern that Russia was preparing an invasion of Ukraine.
The author of the material is the former Romanian foreign minister and MEP caught while receiving bribes disguised in consulting contracts, convicted in 2016 for this. After his release from prison, Adrian Severin adopted a virulent anti-Western speech, and many of the theses he issued are similar to those of Russian propaganda.
OBJECTIVE: Inducing the idea that the USA is an aggressor entity, while Russia is only trying to secure its borders and is acting for defensive purposes.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In support of these claims that the USA proposed to Russia the dismemberment of Romania, the author does not provide any evidence and there are no relevant documents or testimonies to prove them. Adrian Severin tries to link this imaginary offer of the USA with the theses of the American theorist Samuel L. Huntington (see page 30) who also worked for the Washington administration as an adviser on foreign policy and security issues. Huntington only launched a theory about religious and cultural identity and the conflicts that could arise at the intersection points of different cultures. Coincidentally, Russia itself is the one that emphasizes cultural and religious identity in contrast to the Western one, which is much more permissive, inclusive and tolerant.
""The Clash of Civilizations"" is a work that appeared after the end of the Cold War and after the collapse of the USSR - the article on which the book was based was published only in 1993!
Moscow also claims that the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, was promised at the end of the Cold War that NATO would not expand, but there is no document attesting to this promise and several Soviet officials of the time, including Gorbachev, said that it it would not have been done. The West also rejects this narrative. Moreover, recently, the former translator of the last leader of the USSR, Pavel Palajchenko, declared that no Western leader would have promised Gorbachev that NATO would not expand in Eastern Europe. Moreover, Palajchenko admitted this live on one of the most popular state stations in Russia - Rossia 24.
In another vein, the association between the USA and Nazi Germany is one of the main themes of Russian propaganda advanced including by the Russian embassy in Romania and dismantled by Veridica.ro.
The demonization of the USA is part of the usual arsenal of Russian propaganda, this after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, and since then shows increasing hostility in the Black Sea area.
Last but not least, Adrian Severin's material, , talks about the fact that Russia does not want to impose a government on Moscow's docks in Kiev, but at the same time talks about the Euromaidan in Kiev at the end of 2013 as a ""color revolution"" to the West and not to the desire of Ukrainians to choose the European path for Ukraine. And this is one of the favorite themes of Russian propaganda, which accuses that the Euromaidan was ""a coup d'état by some fascist leaders"". Moreover, the Kremlin has a real obsession with what it calls the ""color revolutions"", pro-democracy movements in the ex-Soviet states, because it fears that, on the one hand, these movements remove the respective countries from its sphere of influence, and on the other hand, he does not want such movements to reach Russia, where they can threaten the regime.The hostility towards civil society and the independent press must be read in the same key.
THE NUTS OF TRUTH: Russia and the West are negotiating on the demands recently put forward by the Russians regarding certain guarantees that NATO will not expand further to the east. Publication / Media:

The false narrative is a reaction to the news regarding the mobilization of territorial defense units by Kiev in the context of the threat of a Russian invasion.
NEWS: ""It seems that we were expecting a massacre: the territorial defense forces of Ukraine received weapons. Territorial defense units in the border areas of Ukraine [in the east of the country] on January 15 received weapons and information about the deployment, and by the end of winter members of these forces in all regions will be armed. [...]
The author of the WarGonzo project, Semen Pegov, considers this news to be really bad news: ""Let me explain - a large part of Ukraine's territorial brigades is made up of true ultra-nationalists. It seems that we were expecting a real massacre"", according to his Telegram channel, quoted by the news portal of the Donbass separatists Ruskaia Vesna.
The territorial defense units in Ukraine are composed of radical nationalists, and many brigades exist only on paper, according to Discover24.
These nationalists could be a tool of Ukraine in the east of the country. ""In the shortest time, the situation in Donbass could worsen"", writes the NVL portal. NARRATIVE: Extremist nationalists from the territorial defense forces of Ukraine will massacre civilians in Donbass.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Following the concentration of over 100 thousand Russian soldiers on the borders of Ukraine, the location of military equipment and techniques, Kyiv has initiated the organization of a new territorial defense structure, which will be additional to the traditional army. The Russian press reacted to the news about the arming of the members of the territorial defense forces with various false narratives about the warlike intentions of Ukraine, thus continuing the older narratives according to which Kiev would have organized, with the support of the West, a genocide that targeted the Russian-speaking population of Donbass .
During 2021, but also at the beginning of the current year, the pro-Kremlin press wrote about Ukraine's desire to attack the Donbass or Russia, increasingly accusing what it called the Russophobia of Kiev and the West.
Veridica has already analyzed a series of false narratives on this topic. The press organs of the Russian government and those of the self-proclaimed republics DNR and LNR present the situation in Donbass not as a conflict artificially supported by Moscow to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, but as a genocide organized by Ukraine and the West.
To sow fear of Kiev in eastern Ukraine, the pro-Kremlin media distributed news about Ukrainian Nazism, which is dangerous for Russia. The narratives in question were recently dismantled by Veridica.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to present the process of establishing territorial defense in Ukraine not as a defensive operation and a reaction to Russian threats, but as an initiative by Kiev to attack Russian speakers in Donbass.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, territorial defense in Ukraine is a new element in the security system, which has no offensive purpose. The territorial defense forces represent a reserve component of the Ukrainian army. In this regard, 25 territorial defense units were created, which include over 100 thousand non-professional soldiers. According to the concept of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the purpose of these territorial defense units is to buy time in the event of an attack on any region or city until professional soldiers can be sent to the scene.
According to the representatives of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, territorial defense is subordinated to the Ministry of Defense, therefore the confessional or ideological beliefs of its members (nationalists, socialists, etc.) do not matter. Taking into account the purpose of the territorial defense forces to hold the enemy in place until the arrival of professional soldiers, the arming of these troops does not in any way represent any danger for the Russian speakers of Donbass.
Journalist Semen Pegov, who wrote about the ""massacre"" planned by Ukraine and is quoted by the pro-Kremlin press, manages a Telegram channel with over 140 thousand subscribers. He is close to the leadership of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and known through the fake news he has distributed in recent years. For example, in April 2021 he wrote for the Russian press that Ukraine hired mercenaries from Syria to organize a genocide against the inhabitants of Donbass. Ukrainian press reported in August 2020 as one of the leaders of the self-proclaimed Republic of Donetsk, Denis Pusilin, called Semen Pegov ""friend, colleague and brother"". Pegov was decorated with the Russian ""Merit to the Fatherland"" order for the correct coverage of the events in Crimea in 2014. He was also active on the territory of Belarus during the protests in 2020, writing about the protesters ""paid"" by the West. Publication / Media:

The narratives aim to fuel the population's discontent in the context of the increase in prices for natural gas and products.
NEWS: ""The energy crisis in Moldova is worsening the situation more and more. Recently, on January 2, 2022, after a sudden increase in the price of liquefied gas in Kazakhstan, massive protests broke out that shook the whole world. Is such a scenario possible here? Asked by our portal, Valeri Demidetchi provided an answer to this question. ""At first glance, in Moldova there are the same reasons and the same trigger for a social explosion and riots as in Kazakhstan. After the change of government, the price of gas in our country increased not twice, but almost three times and continues to increase, being followed by the increase in tariffs for other energy resources, the amounts of invoices for communal services, the price of food products and other essential goods. It proved that the new government is not able to ensure the payment of Russian gas even with the discount offered by Gazprom. It was also found that Chisinau is not able to pay even for gas deliveries from other countries. Despite the fact that until recently, experts and pro-European officials fought among themselves to convince us that fuel is as easy to buy as a pen in a kiosk, urging to break the dependence on Moscow. In reality, the opposite has been proven: already for the second time in two months, the Government is asking Gazprom to postpone payments, intending to declare a state of emergency in the energy sector again. Despite the increase in prices and the sharp drop in the standard of living, as well as other failures of the new government, I do not think that shocks are expected in Moldova. The situation in our country differs significantly from Kazakhstan, where one of the reasons for the crisis was the prolonged transition of power. As my colleagues from Astana told me, it turned into a ""double power without double power"", an aggravation of the struggle between the oligarchic clans, both those in the country and those in exile. No it is a secret that in the past the most serious threats to Nazarbaev, who kept the levers of power, very often came from the circles close to his family. In our country, the main oligarch capable of arranging such a scenario was sheltered by the USA in the past two years. And Washington does not need instability in Moldova, where a government that suits the West is in power. After all, we have long been accustomed to the fact that the definitions of velvet revolutions depend only on how fits into the geopolitical interests of the West. When the protesters entered the Capitol and, unlike the Kazakhs, they were not armed, weapons were used against them, which resulted in casualties. Both the President of the United States and the head of the Department of The state called them terrorists and locked them in prisons. And when in Alma-Ata armed bandits killed policemen and even beheaded them, the same Blinken asked the Kazakh authorities ""not to prevent the demonstrators from expressing their will"". We remember how the former president Vladimir Voronin received the same instructions in April 2009, after supporters of the pro-European parties devastated and set fire to the Parliament building and the Presidency building in Chisinau, injuring hundreds of law enforcement officers. NARRATIVES: 1. The pro-European government is responsible for the increase in gas prices. 2. Vlad Plahotniuc was sheltered by the USA. 3. The velvet revolutions are dictated by the geopolitical interest of the West. 4. The assault on the Capitol in the United States and the incidents in Kazakhstan are identical cases. 5. The West denounces the use of force against terrorists but resorts to it against its own civilians.
CONTEXT: In the context of the increase in gas prices on the international market, the Republic of Moldova signed a new natural gas delivery agreement with the Russian concern Gazprom. According to contractual commitments, for the months of November and December, the Republic of Moldova purchased gas at a price of approximately 450 dollars per thousand cubic meters, and in January at 646 dollars per thousand cubic meters. Thus, the tariffs for domestic consumers were increased and, most likely, other increases would be made. In this context, several criticisms and accusations were brought to the government regarding the increase in gas prices and the price increases for products that followed.
The Republic of Moldova remained almost totally dependent on the energy resources of the Russian Federation. In October, Gazprom reduced gas deliveries to the Republic of Moldova, thus Chisinau had to maintain pressure in the system by procuring for the first time gas from sources other than Russian, from the EU (especially Romania) and Ukraine. The purchase price was the one on the European market, which most residents of the Republic of Moldova cannot afford. Also, the construction of the Iasi-Chisinau pipeline could ensure the gas needs for the Republic of Moldova, but without the separatist region of Transnistria, which consumes almost two thirds of the total volume of natural gas (without paying for this consumption). When negotiating the new gas delivery agreement with Gazprom, the Kremlin tried to impose certain political conditions on the pro-European authorities in Chisinau.
The increase in gas prices caused a wave of protests at the beginning of the year in another former Soviet republic, Kazakhstan, a country rich in natural resources, but with a population kept in poverty by a corrupt authoritarian regime. The protests degenerated into violent ones, and the social claims were followed by political demands. The popular demonstrations were stopped with the help of the forces of the Treaty Organization for Collective Security, an operation led by the Russian Federation. The authorities in Kazakhstan, as well as Russia, stated that terrorists with connections outside the country were behind the violence, and in this context the thesis of ""color revolutions"" was also revived. This terminology is used for pro-democracy and pro-democracy movements. pro-Europeans from several countries in the ex-Soviet space.The Putin regime, whose grip on power is threatened by pro-democracy movements, has been trying to discredit them for years.
The massive protests that took place in the Republic of Moldova in 2009, which later led to the change of the political regime of the Communist Party led by Vladimir Voronin, were assimilated to the so-called color revolutions. The protests initially had political claims, then being denounced as electoral fraud, in the context where the PCRM held total power in the Republic of Moldova. Also, a strong protest current was generated by the opposition and civil society during the corrupt mafia-type regime of Vladimir Plahotniuc.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to compromise the current government and to fuel the discontent of the population, in the context of the increase in the prices of natural gas and products.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The price of gas has increased, including in the Republic of Moldova, because of increases on the world market, not because of the change of government in Chisinau, which is pro-European. The negotiations with Gazprom lasted exactly one month, and the authorities managed to obtain a price twice lower from the Russian concern Gazprom than on the European market. Also, the Government compensates a large part of the population's bills for gas and heating agent, in addition, it offers 700 lei each to families with low incomes, during the cold period of the year.
Regarding ""the main oligarch sheltered by the USA"", the author refers to Vladimir Plahotniuc who fled the Republic of Moldova after the 2019 elections, when the PSRM and the ACUM Bloc (PAS and DA Platform) formed a governing coalition. time, Vladimir Plahotniuc was allegedly seen in Miami, USA. Later, the State Department declared Vladimir Plahotniuc and his family members ""ineligible for obtaining visas to enter the USA"", in connection with his involvement in ""significant acts"" of corruption, which undermined the rule of law and seriously compromised the independence of democratic institutions in Moldova"". Therefore, the statement that the oligarch is sheltered by the USA is a lie. In 2020, the General Prosecutor's Office announced that it had received confirmation that he was in Turkey and asked for his extradition. Later, information appeared in the press that Vladimir Plahotniuc was in Cyprus.
The publication resumes the narratives regarding the involvement of the West in the color revolutions and claims that the USA gave instructions to Vladimir Voronin not to intervene forcefully against the protesters. In 2009, the protests in Chisinau really degenerated into violent ones, and the police did not intervene to defend the Parliament and Presidency buildings. Moreover, the impression was created that certain violent groups were intentionally allowed/brought to enter these buildings, in order to hijack the peaceful protests. Later, however, in the evening of April 7, 2009, the police acted brutally, beating and arresting the few protesters who were still in the city center, one of the young people being killed in a fight by the police. Dozens of young people were beaten in police stations. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""We, the Romanians, despite some temporary slip-ups and some guilty illusions that the former leaders of Romania had, we appreciated, admired and loved the brave and proud Nation of the Serbs, always reborn from the ashes like a Phoenix Bird of the Balkans despite his great and terrible enemies who would have wanted him on his knees for good!
""The case"" of the great Serbian athlete is not about ""technical issues"", about the passport, about testing and vaccination. Not.

""Dan Tomozei brings to the attention of the public in Romania the gesture of honor made by the president of Serbia who defended the tennis player Novak Djokovic in his dispute with Australia because he is not vaccinated.
[...]
""YES! This is how a world leader defends himself, a model of conduct and modesty, despite his value and financial-material resources!"", Tomozei writes on his Facebook account.
He praises the president of Serbia for coming out publicly to defend the ATP world leader, Novak Djokovic, who was treated unacceptably by the Australian authorities!"" (sputnik.md)
NARRATIVES: 1. Novak Djokovic defeated the health dictatorship. 2. Novak Djokovic was persecuted by the Australian authorities because he is Orthodox from the Balkans. 3. The world occult is trying to control the population through anti-Covid measures and to turn people into prisoners stuck in their own homes. 4. Serbia is a worthy country, which, although it was unfairly the target of Western persecution, could not be brought to its knees. 5. Romania betrayed Serbia, a loyal friend, in 1999, when it allowed NATO planes to fly over its territory.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Novak Djokovic, a declared follower of natural medicine, has clearly said since 2020 that he does not agree with the mandatory vaccination, and later refused to say publicly whether he had been vaccinated against Covid or not (it was found out in the meantime not). In order to receive the Australian visa, the world number 1 obtained a medical exemption that was granted to him after proving that he was infected with SARS-CoV-2 in December. Australia is one of the countries with the most draconian policies of anti-Covid restrictions, the city of Melbourne, for example, being quarantined, in total, since the beginning of the pandemic, for almost 9 months. The news that Djokovic received the visa generated protests from the population, against the background of complaints regarding a preferential regime granted to some VIPs. Once he arrived in Australia, Djokovic was informed that he would be deported and put in a hotel-prison until his departure, but a few days later a judge found that the Serbian player had fulfilled all the necessary formalities, so the visa revocation was illegal.
The initial decision to revoke his visa was also seen as a political act, part of a dispute between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the local government of the state of Victoria. In Serbia, where the scandal generated a wave of indignation, Djokovic's cause was also taken up by nationalists, who resumed older theses regarding the persecution of Serbs by the West, and even the president and the prime minister intervened. The player's family was very virulent, initially comparing him to Jesus Christ and, later, to a Spartacus of the new world and a symbol of ""the free world, of poor and disadvantaged nations and peoples"".
The Djokovic scandal also caused a stir among the anti-vaccinist and corona-skeptic movement, which interpreted this case in terms of political struggle - on the one hand, those who try to limit fundamental freedoms through health measures, on the other hand, those who they oppose in the name of freedom.
However, the Djokovic scandal did not end with the court's decision that the player be released. He later admitted that in the two weeks before arriving in Australia he had traveled, although he had written the opposite on the declaration made to enter the country; Djokovic claims, however, that the document was completed by his team. On the other hand, the tennis player went out in public, including without a mask, after December 16, when the PCR was tested. The tennis player says that on the 17th, when he met with junior tennis players, he did not know that he was infected - although the result came out on the evening of the 16th - but he admitted that, although he knew he had Covid, he gave an interview on the 18th. In addition, a Der Spiegel investigation raises questions about the PCR test and its veracity. The Australian minister for immigrants can still revoke Djokovic's visa, who if he lied risks having additional problems both in Australia and in Serbia (if it turns out that he knowingly spread the Covid); until the time of writing this material, the Djokovic case had not yet been settled.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Legitimizing the opposition to vaccination by moving the discussion from the scientific area to the political area.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Novak Djokovic did not try to change Australia's health policies in any way; the Serbian player used the existing legal provisions, obtained a medical exemption and based on that exemption he initially received an entry visa to Australia. Djokovic's legal team attacked in court the fact that the Australian authorities violated their own rules. There is no evidence that the decisions of the Australian authorities were influenced by Novak Djokovic's nationality or religion. The very fact that the court decided in Djokovic's favor shows that the authorities cannot act discretionarily, as claimed by anti-vaccinists and followers of conspiracy theories.
Regarding Serbia and the sovereignist narratives related to it (of Serbian nationalists and admirers of the country), it should be noted that radical nationalist policies have proven extremely harmful for Serbia. They were one of the main causes of the Yugoslav wars and the isolation of Belgrade. From the dominant force of Yugoslavia, Serbia has become one of the least developed states in the Western Balkans, behind other ex-Yugoslav countries that have proven to be much more serious in terms of democratization and reforms (Slovenia and Croatia have been members of the EU and NATO for years, North Macedonia and Montenegro have shown that they are determined to follow the same path). The nationalist policies and authoritarian tendencies of the Vucic regime, as well as its association with Russia and China, make even more distant the prospects of Euro-Atlantic integration that could offer both real security and a chance for prosperity.

The narrative starts from an approach aimed precisely at protecting consumers.
NEWS: ""The double standard of product quality was legislated by the European Commission. Thus, officially, in Romania it will be possible to sell goods under the same brand, manufactured especially for third-class countries, that is, a kind of by-products sold at the same price to third-class European citizens. As a consolation, the Ministry of Economy introduced the obligation for companies to specify the difference between products on labels. The pressure exerted on the EU, during Dragnea's time, to put an end to the entry on the Romanian market of some products under the same brand, but with an inferior quality, did not have the expected effect. However, the European Commission appealed and agreed to amend Directive 2005/29/EC, admitting that any activity of marketing a good, in a member state, as being identical to a good sold in other member states, is a deceptive commercial practice. although the respective good has a significantly different composition or characteristics. However, the new article introduced in the directive has an exception, that of the case where this is justified by legitimate and objective factors. The provision was taken over in a draft ordinance by the Government, and, as a consolation, the Ministry of Economy introduced an article that requires companies that practice a double standard of quality to specify this on the product label"", it is shown in an article from the National.ro portal
NARRATIVE: 1. Romania is a second-hand country in the EU and a ""consumption colony"" of the West.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Russian propaganda continues to insist on the theme of Romania as a second-rate state in the European Union, treated with double standards by Brussels and as a European consumption periphery of low-quality products of international corporations.
Transcription of European Directives into national legislation is seen as a form of political and economic subordination of the newer EU member states to the older states within the Union.
They march on the idea that Romania is treated discretionarily, as a colony of the West's political-commercial interests and a consumer market, and that thus the country's sovereignty is undermined. At the same time, narratives of this type want to induce the idea that Romanians are second-class European citizens.
OBJECTIVE: To create a heightened sense of Euro-skepticism and a hostile attitude towards the European Union and more broadly towards the West.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: First of all, Directive 2005/29 of the European Commission has not undergone any recent changes. Its last revision, according to the official website of the European Commission, dates from May 20, 2020.
Directive 2005/29/EC distinguishes two categories of commercial practices that are unfair if they cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that the consumer would not otherwise have taken: deceptive commercial practices (by action or omission) and aggressive commercial practices.
What the Romanian Ministry of Economy is currently doing through the ordinance complained about by the author of the article is to put the European legislation in the matter for a better assurance of compliance with the legal norms in the matter of consumer protection and the modernization of these norms.
In article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2, the obligation is introduced for merchants to specify if, in the case of an activity of marketing a good on the territory of Romania, as being identical to a good sold in other member states, even though the said good has a composition or significantly different characteristics, justified by legitimate and objective factors, traders provide consumers with adequate information regarding the differentiation of goods as a result of legitimate and objective factors, so that this differentiation can be easily identified by consumers. Traders provide consumers with information in a way that allows them easy access to it"".
However, this will allow the consumer to be informed if such a product sold under the same brand has different characteristics in Romania, compared to other countries, a fact that has not happened until now.
In other words, the seller is now obliged to signal very visibly and easily for the potential buyer if there are such differences and what exactly they are.
""This ordinance transposes into national legislation Directive (EU) 2019/2161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 27, 2019 amending Council Directive 93/13/EEC and Directives 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding a better assurance of compliance with the Union's consumer protection rules and the modernization of these rules, published in the Official Journal of the European Union, series L, no. 328 of December 18, 2019"", it is shown in the draft ordinance of the Ministry of Economy.
Therefore, Romania adjusts its internal legislation on the basis of the European Directives on consumer protection.
Amendment Directive (EU) 2019/2161 introduces a specific rule that addresses the deceptive marketing of some goods as being identical when, in reality, the composition of their characteristics is different (often referred to as ""differentiated quality goods"") and defines exactly what it means ""deceptive omissions"" and ""aggressive commercial practices"" (See the Unfair Commercial Practices section in the link).
It should be noted that National.ro is a publication that constantly expresses in its articles these narratives of Russian propaganda, which it tries to transform into topics of internal debate in Romania, a fact frequently noticed by Veridica.ro.

The narrative is built with the help of false arguments about the increasing level of crime following the war in Donbass.
NEWS: ""There is an epidemic in Ukraine. It started not in 2020, but in 2014. And the most terrible thing is that this epidemic is worse than the coronavirus, because it affects not the lungs, but the brain. It's about Nazism. [...] The depressive atmosphere is intensified by mass crime even among the military - ""heroes of ATO"" [Anti-Terrorist Operation], whose ""shining images"" are actively used by Ukrainian militarist propaganda.
The crimes of soldiers returning from the area of ​​the Anti-Terrorist Operation have a mass character: shooting people and confiscating various objects, drug addiction and alcoholism, participation in the activity of neo-Nazi groups and the creation of criminal gangs - all these are a natural consequence of the military's participation in a war without end, of the general decline of the state and the mental illnesses of the popular masses in Ukraine. In other words, the citizens of Ukraine can become an ""accidental victim"" of the dogs of war...
[...]
In the west of Ukraine, the activities of creating extreme right-wing groups began with the direct support of the Ukrainian diaspora and the Western special services.
[...]
In the process of feudalization of Ukraine that is taking place today, every regional master needs his own military detachments, but he simply has nowhere to find them, except for ultra-right groups and ""old soldiers"".
[...]
The current post-Maidan regime represents a very specific threat to Ukraine's neighbors and to the people. This is especially true for Russia, because there is a problem of Crimea in the relations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine [...]. At the same time, Ukraine does not hide its intentions to profit territorially in the future, with the support of the West, following the weakening of Russia if it loses geopolitical competition, and the new forces within the Russian state, which could come to power, will aim a reconciliation with the West.""
NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine became a Nazi state with the direct support of the West; 2. The Ukrainian state represents a danger to Russia's security; 3. In Ukraine, the level of crime is increasing following the war in Donbass.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: At the beginning of 2022, the Russian government press published a series of articles with the aim of showing that Ukraine is a Nazi or neo-Nazi state, these narratives being a continuation of the messages from the years 2020-2021, mentioned in the public space - Soviet on the occasion of the anniversaries of important dates in the history of the USSR.
After the events of 2014 (the Euromaidan in Kiev, the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the outbreak of the conflict in Donbass), Kiev is categorized as a Nazi by the Moscow press, especially when it comes to Victory Day, marked with great pomp by Russia. Starting from 2014, Ukraine renounced some Soviet narratives regarding the Second World War, introducing in its official calendar a compromise holiday - the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation - to reconcile both the descendants of Soviet war veterans and those of fighters from the Rebel Army, composed of Ukrainian nationalists. Kyiv is gradually moving to a calendar of civic holidays close to the European one, and the Russian press considers the adoption of these approaches by Ukraine to be a betrayal, an attempt to rehabilitate and revive Nazism. In 2021, Veridica analyzed a series of false narratives about the West's encouragement of the development of Nazi ideology in Ukraine and about the erasure from the collective memory of the heroic and liberating image of the Soviet Union in the Second World War.
In the context of discussions at the international level about the concentration of Russian troops on the borders of Ukraine, the Russian government media resumed these false narratives about the West ""encouraging the Nazi ideology in Ukraine"" and which forgot about the heroism of the USSR (of Russia) during the liberation of Europe from the Nazis .
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of these narratives is to show the public opinion in the post-Soviet space that following the approach to the West and breaking with the ""Russian world"" Ukraine has become Nazi, dangerous for the neighboring states, and the lives of civilians are in danger due to the activity of some neo-Nazi paramilitary groups, not controlled by the authorities.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FAKE: The author of the article published by Ukraina.ru, which is part of the government media trust ""Russia Today"", writes about a flourishing of Nazism in Ukraine without providing arguments or evidence, apart from listing some crimes committed of former Ukrainian soldiers who returned from the area of ​​the Anti-Terrorist Operation in Donbass. After remembering the crimes of this kind covered by the Ukrainian media, the author draws the conclusion that Ukraine is a Nazi state, based on an extreme right-wing ideology, which enjoys of supporting the population. According to official statistical data, starting from 2016, on the contrary, there is a decrease in the level of crime in Ukraine, and the forces that officially declare themselves ultra-nationalist did not pass the electoral threshold in the 2019 parliamentary elections.
In other words, the thesis of the narrative on the Ukraina.ru website not only does not illustrate Ukrainian Nazism, but is absolutely false. In reality, we cannot talk about any revival or rehabilitation of Nazism in the West or in Ukraine. The Nazi ideology was condemned and is banned in Ukraine, as well as the communist ideology.
The thesis about the West's encouragement of Nazism in Ukraine is not true either, and the information about the support of extreme right-wing groups by the ""Western special services"" is nothing but an invention of the author. It should be noted that both Russian politicians and the press government in Moscow, categorizes any elements of the national-linguistic or cultural revival in the post-Soviet space as Nazi or neo-Nazi. Basically, narratives of this type equate nationalism and/or the assumption of a national identity with Nazism. Ukrainian nationalist movements are called Nazis because it insistently promotes in the public space the idea of ​​breaking ties with the geopolitical traditions of the ""Russian world"". This is also the case with the political forces from the Republic of Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia who advocate a return to the ethnic roots before the Soviet annexation of these territories, called by the pro-Kremlin press Nazis / fascists / xenophobes / traitors, etc.
Without bringing any argument for the false statements regarding Nazism in Ukraine, both the Russian press and the high-ranking politicians in Moscow want to generate negative emotions in the post-Soviet collective mind. It should be noted that in Ukraine the ""Law on the Condemnation of Communist and Nazi Totalitarian Regimes and Their Symbolism"" was adopted, while in Russia the rehabilitation of Stalinism is currently taking place. In Russian history textbooks, the very important role of Joseph Stalin in consolidating the Soviet Union, and the crimes he committed were ""out of historical necessity"".
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: The subject of the difficult integration of war veterans into the life of society is an older topic of research in sociology and psychology. Often, demobilized soldiers find it difficult to return to normal life and are affected by post-traumatic syndrome (PTSD) and need specialized assistance. However, this is valid for veterans from all countries, including the Russian ones. The problems of the latter are ignored by Moscow or the pro-government press; moreover, Veridica recently wrote that the mercenaries who fought in Donbass are becoming a burden for the Kremlin. They are judged and then extradited. They cannot integrate into Russian society, they organize themselves in different paramilitary groups, they become elements of organized criminal groups, representing a danger to the authorities and public order. A representative case is the extradition of Oleg Snidinov, a criminal who fought in the troops of the self-proclaimed Lugansk republic. Russia decided to extradite him to Ukraine.
In Ukraine, there are indeed followers of the extreme right, and some of them also fought in Donbass, especially in the Azov battalion, formed as a distinct militia and later incorporated into the National Guard. The politicians representing the far-right do not, however, benefit from significant support and are not in power. Publication / Media:

The narrative was launched in Chisinau to trivialize corruption and undermine the pro-European government, which has among its priorities the anti-corruption fight and judicial reform.
NEWS: Socialist deputy Bogdan Tirdea wrote on his Telegram account that ""Dodon gave people real money, and Sandu takes them with candy"". from the people to give salaries to the rich"", commented the socialist deputy, in response to a pamphlet, which referred to the ""kuliokul"" episode in which ex-president Igor Dodon was involved. NARRATIVES: 1. Igor Dodon did not take the money from Plahotniuc for himself and his party, but to give it to the poor. 2. Igor Dodon is not corrupt, but an ""outlaw"", and the case with the bag of money is not one of corruption, but of charity. 3. Maia Sandu and PAS use the money taken from the population to enrich a blanket privileged.
CONTEXT: In 2019, after the flight from the Republic of Moldova of the oligarch Vladimir Plahotniuc, video images appeared in the public space in which he negotiates with former president Igor Dodon regarding a PDM-PSRM governing coalition. Plahotniuc offers a black bag to Igor Dodon, which is supposed to contain a large amount of money. According to the images, filmed at the PDM headquarters, Igor Dodon tells Plahotniuc to pass the bag of money to Cornel (Furculita, PSRM member) for the salary of his party members. In the respective images, Igor Dodon also tells that he receives money for the party, monthly, and from the Russian Federation. The case, called by the press ""kuliok"" (bag), caused a real scandal in society, but the Prosecutor's Office refused to investigate it and closed the file because it did not discover ""the elements of any crime"" and that it ""did not it was possible to establish"" the contents of the bag and the author of the video recording. At that time, Vlad Plahotniuc exercised extensive control over the country, being extremely influential in politics, the business environment and the media. Plahotniuc was also attributed relationships important in the judicial and administrative system. After Vlad Plahotniuc fled the country, his network was largely taken over by Igor Dodon and his allies, who for several months were allied with Maia Sandu and PAS before forcing their departure Dodon's image came to be associated with corruption, and this is one of the main reasons why the former president was defeated in the presidential elections without a rightful appeal and, subsequently, the party he led, the Socialist Party, lost the parliamentary elections. Maia Sandu and PAS, who won the respective elections, came to power with an anti-corruption speech and launched a series of reforms that also target justice.
Regarding the narrative that ""good people"" take money from the population to give ""salaries to the rich"", the author has in mind the salary increases for civil servants, from 2022, operated by the PAS government, including for the six judges of the Constitutional Court (who will receive approximately 30 thousand Moldovan lei per month, which is approximately 1500 euros). These increases served as the subject of numerous articles in the press from Chisinau, especially the one affiliated with the PSRM, the salary increase being treated as a negative thing. At the same time, in this context, an attempt was made to affiliate the judges of the Constitutional Court with the Action and Solidarity Party. The press did not mention, however, that it is only about six judges, who represent the highest court and who must guarantee the supremacy of the Constitution. Other representatives of the state, heads of regulatory institutions and state agencies, such as BNM, CNPF, ANRE, ASP, ANRCETI, as well as the directors of some state enterprises, also receive high salaries, between 40 thousand and 150 thousand lei , MoldATSA, Moldtelecom, Termoelectrica, Radiocommunications and others.
Bogdan Tirdea is one of the most visible propagandists from the socialist camp, being known especially for his virulent attacks and the numerous disinformation and fake news regarding the civil society in the Republic of Moldova - in fact, a number of NGOs that have constantly advocated - over time, for the reformation of the country, transparency, rule of law, etc., thus harming the interests of corruption networks in the political and business area.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to trivialize the ""kuliokul"" case and the idea of ​​corruption in general, but also to wash the image of Igor Dodon who would not have taken money for personal or group benefits but for the people. At the same time, the socialist deputy tries to minimize this serious case of corruption and to shift the focus to the PAS government, which increased the salaries of civil servants, including the 6 judges of the Constitutional Court.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The ""Kuliok"" file is a serious case of corruption, which was denounced by politicians and civil society. The video images, filmed in the PDM headquarters and most likely released publicly by Vladimir Plahotniuc himself, clearly show the fact that Igor Dodon accepts the money. He says he will use it for PSRM salaries, not to ""give it to the people"", as Bogdan Tirdea claims. Even if this money was ""given to the people"", it is still a case of corruption, and the money offered by the fugitive oligarch Plahotniuc also comes from obscure sources.
The increase in the salaries of the judges of the Constitutional Court (as well as other incomes) was done in a transparent manner and is also related to the efforts to reform and fight corruption, given that the institution has been targeted over time by suspicions of corruption. Such suspicions exist at the level of numerous institutions, and one of the causes of corruption over time was the low level of salaries. The beneficiaries of corruption in the Republic of Moldova are precisely the ""rich"" - characters from the business or criminal environment, who obtain advantages by bribing some officials or appointing close ones in key positions; the rich are not those who have increased their salaries from which they live .

The source is a title that falsely attributes a statement to the head of the EC representative in Bucharest.
NEWS: ,,Head of the C.E. Representative maintains that Romania must give up its own Constitution in order to comply with the CJEU"" says stiripesurse.ro in the presentation of an interview given to news.ro by Ramona Chiriac. Both the title of the original interview and that of the takeover of stiripesurse.ro also refer to the PNRR: ""the modification of the PNRR implies a resumption of the entire route"", writes news.ro quoting Ramona Chiriac; ""The modification of the PNRR, 'not at all' in the interest of Romania"" headlines news sources that combine a question-conclusion of the reporter with a single word - ""not at all"" - of the head of the CJEU.
The stiripesurse.ro article is taken on the Facebook page ""Diana Iovanovici Sosoaca - official"", which writes, among other things, that the stake of the PNRR is ""renouncing sovereignty, compulsory vaccination, the abolition of private livestock, the abolition of private property, the closure of mines and the explosion the price of energy, the export of intelligence, the destruction of education, soon the dissolution of the country and the name Romania Region, if we don't get German or Hungarian names.""
Sputnik.md refers to the post on ""Diana Ivanovici Sosoaca - official"", but it presents what is called there ""the stake"" as ""what the European Commission wants from Romania"". The Sputnik article emphasizes the matter of the Constitutional Court - CJEU : ,,Senator Diana Sosoaca intervenes in the scandal of the statements made by Ramona Chiriac, head of the European Commission Representative in Romania, who attacked the CCR and said that European law is above national law.
""If you needed one more proof of national betrayal, of renouncing Romania's sovereignty, due to the fact that vaccination is mandatory and that in the EU we are represented by traitors, sorosists, globalists, sellers of nation and country, here you have living proof of these facts"", writes Sosoaca on Facebook, sharing an article with the statements of Ramona Chiriac."" NARRATIVES: 1. The EU forces Romania to renounce its own Constitution. 2. Through PNRR, Romania loses its sovereignty. 3. Romania will be abolished and transformed into a region. 4. In Romania, private property will be abolished, education will be destroyed, and intellectual elites will be exported.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The Court of Justice of the European Union issued, on December 21, a decision that reaffirms the principle of the superiority of European law over national law; more precisely, Romanian courts can take decisions that violate decisions of the Constitutional Court if those decisions are contradicted by European legislation. The Constitutional Court of Romania came back insisting that in order for the CJEU decision to be valid, the Romanian Constitution should be amended.
The dispute arose in the context in which dissatisfaction and criticism have been expressed in Romania over the years regarding the maintenance of the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism and the attention with which the European Commission monitors Romanian justice. Among the most dissatisfied were politicians who had criminal problems, certain commentators and journalists, promoted primarily by television stations such as Antena 3 and RTV, the first linked to the former convict Dan Voiculescu, the second to the fugitive Sebastian Ghita. These criticisms and dissatisfactions were often clothed in sovereignist type discourses which, on the one hand, remind of the rhetoric of the communist regime in Romania with ""non-interference in internal affairs"", on the other hand of the themes promoted insistently by Russian propaganda.
In the interview given to news.ro by the head of the representative of the European Commission in Bucharest, the CJEU decision was also mentioned, and Ramona Chiriac drew attention to the principle of the supremacy of European law.
In the same interview, the National Recovery and Resilience Plan was also discussed, through which Romania can benefit from almost 30 billion euros provided that it respects the rule of law and EU regulations, continues reforms and reaches 507 fixed targets. The PNRR was negotiated with Brussels before the formation of the current governing coalition, and the PSD would have liked to renegotiate it, but this option is excluded - a simple change of government is not the kind of situation that would justify the modification of the plan.
Sputnik.md is one of the Kremlin's propaganda channels and persistently promotes sovereign themes and disinformation about the EU and NATO. On the website Sputnik.md, public figures from Romania who address such topics are regularly quoted, on a positive note (and not only: the speeches of anti-vaccinists, of those who campaign for the traditional family, etc.).
Diana Sosoaca, one of the most controversial Romanian politicians of the moment, is promoted by Sputnik, which designated her the political personality of the year 2021 and announced, for the first time, that the senator intends to run for the position of president of Romania.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining the population's trust in the EU and promoting the sovereignist discourse.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The head of the EC representative never said that Romania must renounce the Constitution or its sovereignty, but only that ""the recent decision of the Court of Justice reaffirms a principle on which we have constantly expressed ourselves clearly and unequivocal: the supremacy of European law over national law, a fundamental principle, without which the EU cannot function, assumed by any member state at the time of European integration. The supremacy of European law requires that national judges have the power to leave unapplied a decision of the CCR contrary to European law."" Ramona Chiriac specified, at the same time, that both the ""Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (MCV) and the General Rule of Law Mechanism [...] provide for this principle of the supremacy of European law"". Regarding the consequences of violating the principle of the supremacy of European law, the only comment made by Ramona Chiriac was a ""no"" in response to the question if ""without respecting this decision of the CJEU, can Romania still hope for Schengen accession?"". It should be noted that the principle of the supremacy of European law is also clearly established in the Romanian Constitution, in Title VI, Euro-Atlantic Integration. In fact, Romania is the one that wanted to join the EU and the politicians and the population knew from the very beginning that belonging to it implies the assumption and application of European values ​​and regulations.
PNRR does not in any way affect Romania's sovereignty - Bucharest only has to comply with a set of rules drawn up for Brussels to ensure that the money will be used for the development of Romania, in a transparent way, and will not be diverted; therefore, the conditions imposed by the PNRR are, in fact, in the interest of the population.
None of the statements made by Diana Sosoaca have any factual basis: private property has never been threatened in the EU, and in Romania it is guaranteed by the Constitution; the low level of education is the result of the policies of the Romanian authorities and the activity of the personnel in the system, not having any connection with the EU; the departure of the elites, facilitated by the freedom of movement, is caused by the search for better economic opportunities and by dissatisfaction with the political situation and attempts to bring justice under control.

Despite the politicians, however, Romanians appreciate Russia and share the values ​​it defends, according to a disinformation published by the Kremlin's spokeswoman, Sputnik.
NEWS: ""The history of the relations between the Romanians and the Russians is a complex history, which stretches over many centuries, with highlights and shadows. How could it be otherwise? The historical shadows of the relationship between Romanians and Russians seem, at least in official Romanian politics, to be the ones that matter in defining the relations between the two states. Simply, Eastern Romanian politics is marked by a false but dark historical memory, of the unfriendliness between Russians and Romanians [...]
Of course, things are much more nuanced and at any time one can write, very objectively and with arguments, a history of Romanian-Russian friendship, throughout history. Just as the positive influence on Russia can be presented in the modern history of Romania. All that is needed is for historians to have the will to face the political correctness of the official discourse of the Romanian state in recent years: an essentially Russophobic [...] the entire opposition to the progressive ideologies promoted by Western governments is considered ""Russian propaganda"". Any Euro-sceptic and sovereignist speech is considered ""Russian propaganda"". Any pacifist speech, which denounces the aggressive policy and state terrorism of NATO and the USA (it's been 2 years since, in a terrorist action, the American forces killed a high-ranking Iranian official), is quickly denounced as ""Russian propaganda""
[...] But the reason is a perverse one. The servitude to the current ""strategic partners"", the fact that Romania has increasingly become an annex of the regional interests of some great powers in the Black Sea region, the fact that the resources are given to us without negotiation and that the anti-corruption fight has liquidated the power poles in Romania more effectively than the ""class struggle"" had done in the 50s, it had to be somehow justified. Likewise, the revolution of immorality, which upsets, probably irreparably, the settlement of Romanian society, had to be explained and defended. And the best defense was the invocation of a supposed ""Russian alternative"", which would be more frightening [...] But is the Romanian society Russophobic? Despite the propaganda induced for years, Romanian society is not Russophobic. Russian culture remains among the most appreciated in Romanian society [...] Then, how much selling of the country, ideological abuse and loss of values ​​can you justify based on the argument: better this way than with the Russians?"". NARRATIVES: 1. Romania and Russia have a common history, an old friendship and many common values. 2. Romania is a Western colony and has given up its moral values ​​to take over those of the West. 3. The Romanian state has a Russophobic discourse. 4. The sovereignist and pacifist ideas as well as the denunciation of ""progressive ideologies"" have nothing to do with Russian propaganda. 5. The Romanian leaders are weak, without patriotic feelings and not at all ""sovereignist"", ready to sell the country to foreign interests. 6. Romanians support Russia politically because they love Russian culture.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Russia's increasingly pronounced militarism in the Black Sea area in recent years and, more recently, the massive mobilizations around Ukraine's borders as an ultimatum from Moscow, have sparked a series of fears in Romania as well.
The image of Russia as an aggressor state is becoming more defined and pronounced in Romania as well, after Romanian citizens witnessed the approach of Russian troops to Romania's borders, after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
Romania understands that Russia wants to restore its spheres of influence during the Cold War and does not accept that its status as an EU and NATO member country is endangered by Moscow's regional ambitions.
Beyond its actions in the Black Sea - and in addition to them - Moscow has been launching a real propaganda war against the West for years, through which it pursues several objectives. First of all, under the conditions in which Putin's increasingly authoritarian regime feels threatened by the model of liberal democracies, it is sought to undermine it by presenting Russia as a moral alternative to the decadence of the West. At the same time, Russia appears as a ""city under siege"", threatened by propaganda, destabilizing actions (through civil society and the independent press under the control of external forces) and the military actions of the West. Another objective is the justification of Moscow's actions and their presentation in -a light that will give it an advantage. Efforts to beautify history are also related to this aspect (for example by presenting an alternative history of the Second World War, in which Russia no longer appears as the aggressor, as it was until 1941, and appears as the force that almost single-handedly won the confrontation with the Nazis).
Many of these narratives have been adapted in recent years in Romania as well, including those regarding Christian and traditional family values ​​in opposition to those of the LGBT community. The same theme is used for Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: Reducing the fears generated by Russia's aggressiveness in the region. Undermining the population's support for NATO and EU membership and reviving the narratives of communist origin regarding the friendship between the Romanian and Russian peoples (which here replaces the Soviet one). Promoting sovereign theses and those regarding the moral superiority of the eastern space.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The entire text presents a one-sided view of history, which ""omits"" extremely controversial and not at all friendly aspects between what is today Romania and the Russian Federation.
In the last more than two centuries, Bucharest and Moscow had rather very divergent episodes starting from the annexation of Bessarabia by the Tsarist Empire in 1812, continuing with the War of Independence from 1877 and the way in which the peace was concluded, the theft of the Romanian treasury by Bolsheviks during the First World War, the lack of a peace treaty and the lack of elucidation of the situation in Bessarabia between the two world wars.
This was followed by the annexation of Bessarabia during the Second World War, the entry of the Red Army and the establishment of communism in Romania at the end of the conflagration, the plundering of the Romanian economy by SovRomuri. The Romanian communists also had a relationship marked by asperities with Moscow, especially during the Ceausescu regime.
After the Revolution of 1989, when Romania's leadership was taken over by characters suspected of sympathies with and even ties to Moscow, the bilateral relationship entered a semi-blockade. Romania's accession to the EU and NATO were not viewed well by Russia, and its followers from the Republic of Moldova constantly had an anti-Romanian speech.
In recent years, Bucharest's acceptance of receiving American soldiers and military equipment was seen as a threat to its security by Moscow, which also warned that Romania could become a target.
Romania is a partner with equal rights in both NATO and the EU, and membership in the two organizations does not imply the loss of sovereignty but security guarantees, the chance to obtain prosperity and the guarantee of a democratic system opposed to Russian authoritarianism. Practically, belonging to the two confirms the European aspirations that have defined the entire modern history of Romania with the exception of the period when the country was under the control of the Communist Party imposed by force by the USSR.
Russophobia as Romania's policy is another gross falsehood; the fact that there are reservations about Russia's intentions is determined by its policies. At the same time, the description of a historical reality does not represent a form of Russophobia, but only the statement of some facts.
Last but not least, Russian literature has become a leit-motif of Russian propaganda for which the Russian state and its policies should be respected, because it produced great universal writers. This false association between art/culture and the politics of the Russian state is a frequent procedure that Russian propaganda tries to use in Romania to gain sympathy and adherence to its ideas.

373,876,"NATO has a military base in Odessa, on the historical land of Russia",in odessa there is a nato military base that threatens the security of russia,False,[],"['NATO', 'Odessa', 'Russia']",,,,,,,https://news-front.info/2021/12/28/ukraina-sdala-odessu-pod-voenno-morskuyu-bazu-nato,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-nato-are-o-baza-militara-la-odessa-pe-pamantul-istoric-al-rusiei,,04.01.2022,,Ukraine,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/dezinformare/dezinformare-nato-are-o-baza-militara-la-odessa-pe-pamantul-istoric-al-rusiei,,"Odessa, a port city in southern Ukraine, has turned into a NATO military base, according to a story in the Russian media. It also denounces the NATO exercises in the Black Sea and catalogs Odessa and southern Ukraine as Russian lands under foreign occupation.
NEWS: ""NATO ships continue to concentrate in Odessa, which is turning, for now more informally, into a real military base of the North Atlantic Alliance on the occupied territory of Novorossia. In 2021 alone, NATO and allied military ships entered the port of Odessa at least 10 times. [...] Two NATO ships were one step away from provoking a large-scale armed conflict in the Black Sea, in Russia's territorial waters near Crimea.
[...] On December 24, 2021, another NATO warship entered Odessa, this time - one of the most modern frigates of the French Navy ""Auvergne"". The ship arrived in the Black Sea as part of a rotation of the North-Atlantic Alliance forces in the region and it is clear that it was not by chance that he headed for Odessa, which in fact has already turned into a base for the American naval forces, NATO forces and their satellites in the region.
[...] We must remember here that before the coup in Ukraine, NATO was actively preparing for the creation of its own naval bases on the territory of Crimea. Crimea was defended in time and was reintegrated to its native area. However, the refusal to return Odessa and all of historical Novorossia, including continental Taurida, led not only to the exacerbation of vulnerabilities on the peninsula, but also to the emergence of a dangerous NATO military support point in the occupied part of southwestern Russia. And this is a threat to the national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country, which cannot be ignored."" NARRATIVES: 1. There is a NATO military base in Odessa, which threatens the security of Russia. 2. Odessa is part of historical Russia, therefore this territory is a Russian land under foreign occupation.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In 2014, after the street movements that covered the whole country, called Euromaidan, the Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia, and political forces came to power that promised a quick rapprochement with the EU and NATO. In response, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and supported the separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, transformed into a bloody conflict that has so far resulted in the death of over thirteen thousand people. Despite the numerous protests of the international community and the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West, Moscow not only did not stop financing the mercenaries in eastern Ukraine, but also initiated a gradual integration of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk (DNR and LNR) into the Russian Federation .
Novorossia was, historically, a part of the present-day Ukraine integrated into the Tsarist Empire. The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, spoke about Novorussia after the annexation of Crimea, and in Russia there was even a movement with this name, led by the famous Igor Strelkov (Igor Ghirkin), a former FSB officer who, among other things, coordinated the separatist forces in the initial period of the war.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of these narratives is to sow fears among Russian-speaking readers about the NATO states, which, apparently, want to attack Russia. At the same time, the narratives in question justify Russia's right to act with confidence in the extended Black Sea region.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there are no NATO bases on the territory of Ukraine. They can appear only after the accession of Ukraine to NATO, according to the internal legislation and only with the consent of the Constitutional Court, there being a strict regulation by art. 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine. Also, all NATO military bases and training centers can be studied on the interactive map of the Alliance.
During 2021, several military exercises took place, in which, alongside Ukraine, NATO member states, including Romania, participated. According to international law, Odessa is the territory of sovereign Ukraine, and any military or non-military exercises can be carried out near this city. The ""armed provocations"" organized by NATO troops in Russia's territorial waters were nothing more than the presence of foreign ships in an area close to Crimea, Ukrainian territory by international law, but considered by Russia to be the historical peninsula, ""reunified"" in 2014. In other words, Ukrainian territorial waters are considered by Russia to be Russian territorial waters, despite the condemnation of Russia's annexation of Crimea by the international community.
On the other hand, older narratives about the 2014 coup d'état in Ukraine, but also about Novorossia - a geopolitical and military project to capture and ""liberate"" the south of Ukraine, also called in the article in question ""territory under foreign occupation"".
In another vein, if the rotation of NATO ships in the Black Sea area is described as an informal military base, then the Russian press does not mention anything about the illegal presence of military bases, military personnel, armaments, ammunition and offensive systems on the territory of independent states such as Ukraine (Donbass and Crimea), Georgia or the Republic of Moldova. The illegal military presence of the Russian military on the territory of these states, despite their will and condemnation from the international community, is not mentioned by the Russian press. Nor is there any mention of the fact that Russian military bases and Russian-funded mercenaries in Donbass caused thousands of victims in Ukraine.
The narratives in question cement in the Russian-speaking media a meta-narrative launched in December 2021, analyzed by Veridica, according to which Russia is forced to strengthen its forces on the border with Ukraine in order to defend itself against a US and NATO aggression in Donbass. Unlike the disinformation messages from the end of last year, based on the same concept, an expansion of the narrative is also taking place on the south of Ukraine. In fact, these press articles are strikingly similar to the propaganda messages from the USSR period, whose media organs have ""informed"" for decades about the American and NATO aggressor who dreams of destroying the Soviet people. Several generations have been held hostage by these narratives. Soviet, which are revived more and more often by the Russian government media. Publication / Media:

False narratives were promoted regarding the capture of the Republic of Moldova by the West, the intention of the pro-Europeans to destabilize the Transnistrian region, plans to close churches and ban the Russian language, etc. Fake news and disinformation appeared in the PSRM-affiliated press, Russian-language publications from the Republic of Moldova, but also from abroad.
Top 5 narratives

The West is undermining the sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova, and the country will be sold to foreigners. Most of the articles dismantled by Veridica are based on the narrative regarding the interference of the West in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova. This narrative was the main campaign theme of the PSRM in the elections that took place in the Republic of Moldova and continues to be used by the media affiliated with this party even after the takeover of power by PAS, a pro-European party founded by Maia Sandu. If the right-wing forces come to power, the Republic of Moldova will disappear as a state, Moldovans abroad will not have a country to return to, Moldova will become a pocket country, which will execute all the orders of the Westerners, Maia Sandu and PAS will sell foreign lands, Moldova will not survive without friendship with Russia, it will be swallowed up, as some pro-Europeans wish, and it will be used against Russia, our sovereignty is in danger exercised from inside and outside - nationalism, unionism and Romanianism, Maia Sandu was brought to power by Western forces to fulfill their orders, with the help of civil society organizations, foreign structures obtained access to secret information, and in general the West caused all the crises faced by the states in the ex-Soviet space - they are only part of the articles dismantled by Veridica.
Maia Sandu will destabilize the Transnistria region. The Transnistrian theme was also revived by the party press in the context of the elections, and Maia Sandu was the target of attacks regarding the escalation of the Dniester conflict: Maia Sandu needs NATO for a war with Transnistria, Maia Sandu agreed with Zelenski to attack Transnistria, but the Americans and Romanians also want to attack Tiraspol, according to another fake news debunked by Veridica. At the same time, misinformation was released that the Transnistrian region is subject to a blockade by the Republic of Moldova. On the other hand, Russia is presented as a guarantor of security in the region: the withdrawal of the Russian military from the left bank of the Dniester can lead to a war; the presence of the Russian military in Transnistria ensures peace in the region; The Russians in Transnistria must vote with Putin's party in the State Duma elections, as this is the one that defends the Russian world from the West.
The Republic of Moldova - bridgehead in the fight of the West and NATO against Russia. The narrative appears in numerous fake news and disinformation articles, mainly related to Maia Sandu, accused of intending to involve Moldova in a regional conflict, in the context of the events in the neighboring state of Ukraine: the current government from Chisinau wants to take Moldova to NATO and draw it into regional conflicts; NATO would like the Moldovans to fight with Russia in the interest of the USA; 400 American soldiers were brought to Chisinau to participate in the war in Donbass, against Russia. The ""regime"" from Chisinau wants to bring the Republic of Moldova into NATO and is ready to make ""unfriendly"" gestures towards Moscow; and Moldovan citizens will be cannon fodder in the fight with Russia, says former president Igor Dodon in an extensive interview given to Ria Novosti.
The pro-Europeans want to destroy the Orthodox church in Moldova. The narrative appeared in a series of articles, also related to the new government in Chisinau, but also in the context of the Covid pandemic and the restrictions imposed on the population, including parishioners: The pro-European government in Chisinau wants to destroy the Church, limiting the number of believers from places of worship during the pandemic; the pro-Western puppet regime of Maia Sandu wants to lock the Orthodox Church of Moldova in a golden cage and make it obey the new government and its masters from the West; Maia Sandu will take revenge on the Church for supporting Igor Dodon and will close, at the direction of the West, the churches belonging to the Patriarchate of Moscow and favor the takeover of the parishes by the Romanian Patriarchate. The narratives aim to discredit Maia Sandu, in the context in which the Orthodox Church of Moldova, which belongs to the Patriarchate of Moscow, has been constantly involved in political life in Chisinau, especially in favor of pro-Russian politicians.
Moldova is part of the Russian world. The narrative is based on Bessarabia's past within the Russian Empire and then in the USSR and on the fact that a large part of the population speaks Russian. This is constantly promoted by the Kremlin's influential agencies, the Russian-language press, which has a significant weight in the media space in the Republic of Moldova, and pro-Russian politicians from Chisinau. The Russian Federation is our most loyal friend and most reliable strategic partner, declares former president Igor Dodon on Russia Day; Moldova needs Russia to feed its population; only through the Russian language is the statehood of the Republic of Moldova maintained; Russia should intervene in order not to allow Romania to ""swallow"" the Republic of Moldova. The narrative was launched with the aim of emphasizing Moldova's belonging to the sphere of influence of the Russian Federation, the so-called ""Russian world"", because Russia has the right to the territories that were part of the former USSR.

Top 5 FAKE NEWS

FAKE NEWS: Moldova, the American launching pad for a war with Russia. ""400 American soldiers have arrived in Moldova, who will be deployed in Odessa, if the Ukrainian authorities will start the military escalation of the situation in Donbas"". The article was broadcast by Russian websites and taken over in the Republic of Moldova. publication, the soldiers would have been accommodated in the center of Chisinau. The narrative is part of the list of favorite topics of propaganda and disinformation coming from the Kremlin - the danger of NATO and Western aggression towards Russia. The Ministry of Defense from Chisinau denied the information that qualified as fake news.
FAKE NEWS: The Association Agreement with the EU is harmful for Moldova. The Association Agreement with the EU did not bring any gains to the Republic of Moldova, which lost the Russian market, without being able to export to the EU market, according to a false narrative published by the Russian press. The news aims to discredit the economic cooperation between Chisinau and the European Union and to promote the idea that the best solution for the development of the Republic of Moldova is to be closer to Russia. In reality, the foreign trade of the Republic of Moldova increased significantly with the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement, holding a weight of over 60%. On the other hand, exports of goods destined for the CIS countries, in January-October 2021, are equivalent to a share of 15% of the total exports.
FAKE NEWS: Moldova gives up Sputnik V out of hostility towards Russia. The authorities in Chisinau are risking the lives of citizens by refusing the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, writes kp.md, which adds that the decision is actually a geopolitical one and was taken out of hostility towards Russia. In this way, the citizens of the Republic of Moldova would be involved, against their will, in a new Cold War waged against Russia. The news appeared at the beginning of the vaccination campaign in the Republic of Moldova, when the first vaccines donated by Romania arrived. The Russian vaccine was authorized in Moldova, even if it was not certified by international agencies, but it appeared later in Chisinau, as humanitarian aid brought by the politician Igor Dodon.
FAKE NEWS: In the Republic of Moldova, Russian-language schools are being liquidated. The closure of a gymnasium with 51 students gave rise to the false narrative that ""in the Republic of Moldova schools with Russian language teaching are being liquidated"". These types of fake news appear periodically in the Republic of Moldova, where the number of students is decreasing and some schools are being reorganized They aim to feed the phobias of national minorities that the pro-European government in Chisinau will undermine their rights.
FAKE NEWS: The Republic of Moldova welcomes refugees from Afghanistan, wrote bloknot-moldova.md, which refers to a post on Facebook, according to which, on August 28, over 60 passengers of a Bucharest-Chisinau flight were ""Afghans"" , Syrians or maybe Taliban"" and that they already have residence permits in the Republic of Moldova. The news was picked up by several Russian-language media institutions, which commented that they are coming through Romania. The subject of refugees has a special connotation in the Republic of Moldova ; it has already become anecdotal to spread a false narrative in the electoral campaign for the 2016 presidential elections, when, starting from a pamphlet, a series of media institutions wrote that Maia Sandu, who was then facing the pro-Russian Igor Dodon, would be agreed with the West to bring 30,000 Syrians to the country, if he wins the presidential elections.

Top 5 DISINFORMATIONS

DISINFORMATION: Russia has the right to the territories that were part of the former USSR. Russia has the right to the territories lost after the collapse of the USSR, according to a false narrative promoted by the Kremlin spokesperson, Sputnik, while Russia has massed tens of thousands of soldiers and military equipment on the border with Ukraine. The narratives aim to emphasize the former republics' belonging to the Russian space and world and Russia's right over these territories.
DISINFORMATION: The Sandu government is to blame for the increase in gas prices in the world. Igor Dodon accuses Sandu's government of increasing gas prices, when in fact prices have increased on international markets. ""PAS and the head of state must talk with America and Europe, with Soros and others, talk with all their patrons and political partners and find money, not loans with interest, to help the country's population"", commented Dodon. The statements made by Igor Dodon are intended to blame the new government for the price increases caused by the increase in gas prices on the international market. At the same time, the narratives promoted by the former pro-Russian president are intended to discredit the pro-European orientation of the Republic of Moldova. Since November , the Republic of Moldova pays a price of approximately 450 dollars for a thousand cubic meters of gas, according to the contract negotiated by the authorities with Gazprom, and the price obtained by the Republic of Moldova is lower than the one on the European market at present.
DISINFORMATION: The government prefers Moldovans from the diaspora to those from the country. The PAS government considers that the Moldovans in the diaspora are better than those who stayed in the country, according to a story released by a publication from Chisinau. The goal is to generate dissatisfaction with the PAS government, which benefited from a massive vote of the diaspora in the elections. In almost every Moldovan family, at least one member is working abroad. However, these citizens did not betray the Republic of Moldova as the publication tries to insinuate. On the contrary, for over two decades, money transfers from outside the country remain a significant source for the budget of the majority of the population and, at the same time, constitute 15 percent of the GDP of the Republic of Moldova.
DISINFORMATION: Romania was an occupying power in Moldova. Romania is an aggressor and expansionist state, which in 1918 occupied the current territory of the Republic of Moldova, is the narrative conveyed by an outdoor exhibition, in the center of Chisinau, organized by the Youth Movement Urmasii lui Stefan - an association affiliated to the PSRM , established with the stated purpose of ""protecting Moldova from unionism"". The purpose of this narrative is to undermine the Romanian identity in the Republic of Moldova. At the same time, it tries to discredit the image of Romania, which is presented as an aggressor and expansionist state.
DISINFORMATION: The Russian language is in danger in the Republic of Moldova. The decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova canceling the special status of the Russian language represents a step towards the destruction of the state and the union of Moldova with Romania. The article refers to the CC decision of January 21, 2021 declaring unconstitutional the Law on the functioning of languages ​​spoken on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, voted at the end of 2020, and to the one of June 4, 2018, which establishes that the Law on the functioning of languages spoken on the territory of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic since 1989 is an obsolete one. The rights of Russian speakers are respected and protected in the Republic of Moldova, where there are schools with exclusive teaching in Russian, also this language is taught in almost all Romanian schools. Moreover, ethnic minorities, not only Russians, speak and study in Russian, to the detriment of their mother tongue. Also, the State Register of Legal Documents of the Republic of Moldova, the Official Gazette are also translated into Russian. The narrative seeks to induce the false premise that the Republic of Moldova would be a multinational state like the USSR and, just like in the USSR, Russian should be the lingua franca to the detriment of the Romanian language. The Russian language serves as a tool, perhaps the most effective, to promote the interests of the Kremlin in the post-Soviet space and to maintain the respective territories in the so-called Russian world, ""russkii mir"", just as it was during the time of the Russian Empire and the USSR .

The most bizarre 3

Inclusive and health policies are forms of totalitarianism. Vaccination, tolerance of LGBT people, digitization - means the establishment of a totalitarian regime, claims a Russian historian, also taken over by a website from Chisinau. The narratives are part of a campaign to undermine Western democracies by hijacking their underlying values ​​- democracy, freedom, etc. At the same time, it seeks to create a confusion between political concepts and fundamental freedoms and health measures.
Maia Sandu is responsible for the price increases caused by the drought. A news story about the increase in the price of oil, taken over by the PSRM-affiliated press, was falsely associated with the inauguration of the new president of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu. This is intended to blame Maia Sandu for the price increases and the increase in product prices. At the same time, such narratives pursue the goal of producing destabilization and chaos in society. The fact that the price of oil rose during the period when Maia Sandu began her mandate as head of state was just a coincidence. Farmers, producers and economic experts have been anticipating since the summer of 2020 that certain products will become more expensive, against the background of the severe drought that affected the Republic of Moldova at that time.
In Moldova, monuments are being erected in honor of the fascists. The restoration, in Chisinau, of a monument dedicated to the Romanian soldiers from the First World War led to the resumption, by Russia and the pro-Russian press, of the narratives regarding the Romanian army in the Second World War, including those regarding the ""occupation"" of Bessarabia - territory which, in fact, was liberated after its annexation by the USSR following the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. The narratives aim to put the image of Romania and the Romanian Army in the Republic of Moldova in a negative light, but also to mobilize the pro-Russian forces, nostalgic, Moldovan, anti-Romanian.

Top 5 narratives

Romania is a western colony. The meta-narrative appears in numerous FAKE NEWS and DISINFORMATIONS that targeted the public in Romania in 2021. The broad category of this meta-narrative also includes a series of specific narratives - a second-hand NATO state that ""pays the tribute"" by purchasing second-hand technology, a country led by Western ambassadors, robbed by foreigners who seized its resources , they dictate their policy, decide their future and treat the Romanians as they please.
The Christian identity of Romanians is threatened by foreign forces and ideologies (EU, Soros, sexo-Marxists). They undermine traditional values ​​(first of all the family), seek to impose gender ideology or the LGBTQI ideology, they even want to ban holidays and Christian names, according to a wide category of false narratives promoted in Romania by publications that amplify the Kremlin's propaganda, as well as some that are inspired by the American alt-right or the European right. It's basically a variation of the Russian theme of the (Orthodox) fortress under siege (the degenerate ideology of ""Gayropa""). Anti-immigrant propaganda (migration being a threat to racial identity) falls into the same category, but as Romania is more a secondary country of transit for migrants, interventions on this topic are rather secondary: the Church, groups such as the Coalition for the Family or formations such as AUR have assumed the defense of the identity of the Romanians.
Russia has behaved, throughout history, as a friend of Romania and fought for its liberation. The narratives regarding the Russian-Romanian friendship ignore Moscow's aggressions over time, the territorial seizures - primarily the one established by the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact - and a series of other acts that proved costly for Romania, such as the confiscation of the Treasury or spoliation of the economy by the so-called SovRoms. Russia is engaged in an extensive process of historical revisionism, one of the main objectives being the modification of the narrative about the Second World War so that the USSR appears as an aggressed state (its aggressions against the Baltic states, Romania, Poland and Finland being ""forgotten"") which has the unique merit of having won the conflagration. This historical revisionism is translated in Romania by the resuscitation of historical theses from the communist period. In parallel, there is a campaign to victimize Russia, whose image would suffer due to the hostility and propaganda of the West .
The anti-Covid measures decided by the authorities are ineffective. In 2021, the campaign to challenge the health measures taken to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continued. The lockdown and the use of masks were categorized as ineffective, there was a plea for alternative treatments promoted by obscure doctors or influencers without medical training, but which did not receive the approval of the Romanian or European health authorities (Arbidol, Ivermectin), the effectiveness of anti-Covid vaccines was contested . Such false narratives are often promoted with the help of pseudo-scientific data - either false information, or some taken out of context, a special category being that of adverse reactions to vaccines - as well as some medical professionals, usually with specializations that they have nothing to do with virology, or so-called experts in alternative medicine.
Anti-Covid measures violate fundamental freedoms. This type of speech was accentuated against the background of the debates regarding the introduction of the green certificate, which was said, for example, to violate the constitutional right to work (although the Constitution clearly provides, in article 53, the possibility of restricting the exercise of certain rights and freedoms for the defense public health). The narratives in this category all start from the deliberate confusion between matters of a political nature (fundamental rights and freedoms) and of a health nature (health policies, decided according to expertise and scientific data).

Top 5 FAKE NEWS

FAKE NEWS: Romania is led by Western ambassadors. Romania is led by foreign ambassadors, says an online publication, which resumes a thesis frequently used in recent years by populist, nationalist or corrupt figures. This time, as an argument for proving the narrative, a statement was brought by the president of the Senate, Anca Dragu, who said that he has regular meetings with representatives of the diplomatic corps.
FAKE NEWS: Russia, the victim of Western propaganda. The military exercises organized by Moscow in Crimea are legitimate because they take place on Russian territory, stated the Russian ambassador to Bucharest, Valeri Kuzmin, in an interview in which he repeated a series of Kremlin propaganda theses, including some related to the Second World War. Kuzmin also said that Russia has every right to conduct large-scale military exercises on its territory, only that the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed following a military invasion in 2014, is not its territory, according to international law.
FAKE NEWS: Europe, on the verge of a catastrophic blackout. A major power outage, which could last up to two weeks, is imminent in the European Union, stated a part of the mass media in Romania, starting from an alleged warning by the Austrian Minister of Defense. In fact, the Austrian military only considers the possibility of a blackout as part of its crisis prevention program and has launched an information campaign for the population that is nothing unusual.
FAKE NEWS: The European Commission ""cancels"" Christmas and forbids the use of the Christian name ""Maria"". The European Commission wants to ""cancel"" Christmas as part of an effort to impose language that undermines the Christian identity of Europeans. The false narrative refers to an internal communication guide that has since been withdrawn by the Commission. The guide does not attempt to impose anything on EU citizens - it is strictly about the communication of officials, and its purpose is to ensure that this communication does not hurt the feelings of any minority and any EU citizen.
FAKE NEWS: Romania sent equipment and soldiers to Ukraine and will be abandoned by NATO. Romania was drawn into a race by its NATO allies to send equipment, soldiers and instructors to Ukraine, but when Russia starts the war with this country, Bucharest will be abandoned, according to a false narrative published by Evenimentul Zilei.

Top 5 DISINFORMATIONS

DISINFORMATION: Masks and lockdown are useless, exposure to COVID-19 brings herd immunity. The virulence and origin of SARS-CoV-2 and Covid-19, preventive measures, treatments, etc. they were all the target of controversial narratives. One of the most common methods was to quote people from the medical system who, for one reason or another, had alternative opinions. This is also the case of this misinformation that started from the controversial Flavia Grosan, the doctor who claimed to have discovered an extremely effective anti-Covid treatment, stated that the measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 are ineffective and cited an alleged example British herd immunity. The statements were widely taken up and highlighted by the publications that were skeptical about the vaccine.
DISINFORMATION: The shooting of the bear Arthur shows that Romania is a Western colony. The hunting of a trophy bear by a Lichtenstein prince was used as a pretext for resuming the narratives that present Romania as a Western colony. Disinformation sought to take advantage of the wave of indignation generated by this case, which is already the subject of a criminal case for poaching and illegal use of weapons.
DISINFORMATION: Romania was liberated by the Red Army and the Tudor Vladimirescu Division, made up of Romanian anti-fascist volunteers. 77 years after the entry of the Tudor Vladimirescu Division in Bucharest, the Russian Embassy in Romania resumes older theses regarding the liberation of Romania by the Red Army, the role played by that division, made up of former Romanian prisoners of war, and the cooperation between Romania and the USSR. In fact, the ""volunteers"" had a choice between a harsh imprisonment in Siberia (their comrades had died both on the way to the camp and in them) and the possibility of being reinstated.
DISINFORMATION: Romania becomes an Orthodox front against the West. A political force will rise in Romania that will take power to fight for the sovereignty of the country and the Orthodox Church, says the Kremlin spokeswoman, Sputnik. AUR is specifically mentioned, a party that grew up in the niche of populist nationalism occupied in the West by far-right parties that are well regarded by the Kremlin.
DISINFORMATION: ""Romania, the NATO garbage dump"". Romania has become the garbage dump of military equipment from other NATO countries, a fact that derives from its servile behavior towards the allies. The narrative follows the weakening of the public's trust in the international structures of which Romania is a part and which ensures its security and the opportunity for development - the USA and NATO. It is also a reference to the false narrative of the Western colony.

The 3 most bizarre stories

In 2021, the zombie Apocalypse is coming, but humanity will be saved by robots and the Church. Sputnik attributed to Nostradamus prophecies that ""confirm"" conspiracy theories, modern fake narratives and risks taken into account by scientists. The zombie apocalypse, world hunger, catastrophic solar storms, an asteroid that will hit the Earth, the implantation of chips in the military are among the conspiracy theories included in this bizarre fake news promoted by the Kremlin spokeswoman.
Ceausescu was a great leader of sovereign Romania. Sputnik joined the current that tries to rehabilitate Nicolae Ceausescu and to accredit the idea that he was a great leader and a great patriot, and that Romania went through a period of prosperity when he was in power. Concepts that meet with sovereignism, national-communism and proto-chronism are circulated.
The Great Reset aims to kill the elderly with coronavirus and vaccines. The elderly are the target of a real cleansing campaign in which they are isolated from the rest of the population, exposed to coronavirus infection and injected with ""vaccines"" that kill them. It is a fake news published in Romania that takes elements from older narratives, including some promoted by Russia and China, as well as a more recent conspiracy theory, the Great Reset."

The main objective of the false narratives about Ukraine was the manipulation of public opinion in Russia, Ukraine, the former Soviet states, but also Romania, being directly and indirectly attacked the pro-European reforms, the proximity of Kiev to the EU and NATO, the situation of the Russian-speaking population in the east of the country, the situation economic s.a. Most of the disinformation narratives had an anti-Western focus.
The publications most often cited by Veridica were RIA Novosti, Sputnik, Ukraina.ru, Russia 1, as well as other Russian governmental press bodies. Disinformation narratives and fake news tried to destabilize the situation in Ukraine, to prevent the building of partnership relations between Kiev and its western neighbors, to block the vaccination process, to sow distrust in the Ukrainian authorities.
Top 5 narratives

Ukraine is a fake state that will fall apart. Most of the fake narratives promoted by Russia were based on the meta-narrative ""Ukraine - fake state"". The press articles showed the Russian and Ukrainian language reader that the two ""sister-states"" are closely related to each other, and the efforts The West's attempt to ""separate"" these former Soviet republics will not succeed. Ukraine cannot exist without Russia, being a creation of the USSR, and the Ukrainian language is, in fact, a dialect of the Russian language.
NATO and the EU aim to destroy Russia. Most of the time, the Russian government press used the topic of the conflict in Donbass to generate fears and frustrations within the Russian society. The Russian press wrote during 2021 that the West wants a new war in Donbass to ""not allow the development of Russia on the world stage"".
The West encourages Nazism in Ukraine. Ukraine's refusal to celebrate a series of civic holidays following the model of Russia or the former Soviet Union is analyzed by the Russian government media as a ""flourishing of Nazism"" in Ukraine. For example, in the context of Russia's celebration of Victory Day in the Great War for Defense of the Motherland on May 9 and Ukraine's refusal to recognize Moscow's dominant narratives regarding the Second World War, the Russian press writes that neo-Nazism is cultivated in the West, and that Nazi ideology is included in the education system in Ukraine.
Ukraine is turning into a colony of the West, and the population is dying of hunger. After the pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia, and the new Ukrainian authorities signed an Association Agreement with the EU, the media financed by the Kremlin directly or indirectly promotes false narratives about the transformation of Ukraine into an agrarian colony of the West, about Ukrainian children who are suffering from hunger and about Russia's saving role in this geopolitical space.
Ukraine persecutes the Russian-speaking population after the 2014 coup d'état. The narrative in question is distributed weekly by the Russian government media. At the same time, Russia presents its actions in Donbass, Crimea, Transnistria, Ossetia or Abkhazia as being determined by ""political necessity"" and ""historical truth"". Russia presents itself as the liberator, and the West is shown as the occupier. In reality, there was no coup d'état in Ukraine in 2014: after the withdrawal of Yanukovych following mass protests, presidential and parliamentary elections were held, recognized by the international community.

Top 5 FAKE NEWS

The UN denounced the crimes of the Zelensky regime in Ukraine. The Russian press tried to manipulate public opinion by selectively using information from the report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The UN would have criticized Kiev for serious violations of human rights, mentioning, according to the Russian media, that Ukraine ""kills its population"", ""applies torture"" and ""limits freedom of speech"". In reality, most cases of rights violations per person, analyzed in the UN report refers to Crimea and the territories of Donbass, which are not under the control of Kiev, a fact that was kept silent by the Russian media. Moreover, the UN criticizes Russia in the same report for not fulfilling the recommendations of the United Nations experts and praise Ukraine for partially or fully taking into account these tips.
Ukraine's fault for the downing of flight MH-17 continues to be hidden from the West. Seven years after the downing of the Boeing 777 plane carrying flight MH-17 over the Donbass, a series of narratives aimed at excusing the rebels who launched the Russian missile were resumed. The main thesis is that Ukraine is responsible for the tragedy, but the West tried to hide its fault.
Students from Crimea and Donbass will be persecuted in Ukraine. Students from Crimea and Donbass risk being persecuted in Ukraine, according to a disinformation campaign launched by the pro-Kremlin media. The objective of these fake news was to demonstrate to the inhabitants of the Crimean peninsula and the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk that Ukraine persecutes Russian speakers. Russia's goal is to thwart any effort by Kiev to recover and reintegrate these territories.
The Europeans request the construction of Nord Stream 3 and 4 to overcome the gas crisis. The press in Russia often resorted to the generalization of a single opinion or a comment in a publication about a society or a group of states. While in the EU member states the natural gas crisis deepened in 2021, and prices rose, the Russian government media promoted narratives about the panic of the Europeans, who would request Russia's help. The entire narrative was based on a single comment - on an online article - that praises Russia and criticizes journalists who blame Moscow when it comes to the energy crisis in the EU. There have been many other false narratives built on the basis of this model.
Belarus acts according to international norms in the case of migrants, and Ukraine is Nazi and Russophobic. Belarus is only complying with international norms in the refugee crisis at its borders with the EU. Unlike Ukraine, which violates international law and persecutes Russian speakers, Belarus is correct in everything it does for the security of migrants. This false narrative was promoted both by the Russian and Belarusian government media, as well as by officials from Moscow or Minsk.

Top 5 DISINFORMATIONS

Moscow is mobilizing forces on the border with Ukraine to defend itself against a NATO aggression. NATO and the USA could organize an aggression in Donbass, according to a misinformation of the pro-Kremlin media. In reality, it is Russia that, once again, has mobilized significant forces at the borders of Ukraine, threatening Kiev and the West.
Afghan refugees will be directed by NATO to the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. In the context of the takeover of power in Afghanistan by the Taliban after the withdrawal of the American military, the Russian media promoted a series of false narratives about the danger of refugees to Europe, accusing NATO of directing the flow towards the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine.
Ukraine ""privatizes"" the Russian language and does not allow the development of the ""Galitian language"". The ""Galitian language"", spoken in western Ukraine, is different from Ukrainian, but the authorities resort to intimidation and blackmail to prevent specialists from revealing the existence of this language. The narrative appeared in the Russian government press in the context of some analysis groups about Russophobia from Ukraine and Kiev's attempts to ""privatize the Russian language"".
The Association Agreement with the EU is a catastrophe for Ukraine. In 2021, Ukraine and the EU reconfirmed their willingness to continue cooperation within the Association Agreement, especially regarding the economic and political integration of Ukraine. At the same time, the parties discussed some changes to the provisions of the Association Agreement, which was an occasion for a new disinformation campaign launched by the Russian media against Ukraine and the EU, which made comments like ""a catastrophe that has already lasted five years in all spheres"", ""a wrong external option of Ukraine"". Elements of typical narratives were mentioned, among others: ""false state"", ""coup"", ""Russophobia"", ""poverty"" etc.
Russia saves Donbass from the genocide organized by Ukraine and the West. The pro-Kremlin press presented the steps taken to strengthen ties with the separatist republics that Russia supports in Donbass as a measure taken to stop a so-called ""genocide"" committed by Ukraine and the West in the region. In reality, the humanitarian aid of of Russia, were in the years 2014-2017 a perfect method of camouflaging the weapons and ammunition delivered to the separatists. Political analysts and television stations often noted that the hot phases of the confrontations began immediately after the transmission of ""humanitarian aid"" by means of KAMAZ trucks from Russia.

The 3 most bizarre stories

Ukraine feeds its army with Russian mash. At the beginning of 2021, some news agencies published information that Ukraine no longer has potato reserves, and to feed its own army, Kiev buys potatoes and mashed potatoes from Russia. In this way, public opinion remained totally disoriented. On the one hand, Kiev claims loud and clear that it opposes Russian aggression in Donbass (Russia was recognized as an aggressor state by the Parliament of Ukraine), on the other hand, from this press information, which turned out to be fake- news, the result is Ukraine's inability to provide the necessary things (especially food!) for its own army.
The massacre at Fantana Alba, committed by the Romanians. In addition to narratives of disinformation promoted by Russia against Ukraine, you can also find fake news created within the Ukrainian political environment. On the Facebook page of the Cernauti Regional State Administration, a video was published about the massacre at Fantana Alba, in which the history is grossly mystified. Thousands of Romanians who tried to flee to the kingdom, after the USSR had annexed Bessarabia and the north of Bucovina, were killed by the NKVD, but the film taken by the Cernauti Regional Administration says that there were only 50 victims, it ignores the fact that it was ethnic Romanians and catalogs the act as a provocation ""planned and consciously organized by the Romanian special services against the inhabitants of Bucovina"". The Romanian community reacted promptly on social networks and in the press, and the Romanian Embassy in Kiev mentioned that ""compliance historical truth in any attempt to portray the massacre that took place at Fantana Alba"". Therefore, Ukraine seems to have firmly assumed the European path - and discourse - after the Euromaidan of 2013-2014 and the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU in 2016. However, the rhetoric of the media and the political class are still imbued with narratives of Soviet origin.
The EU persecutes Russian speakers to erase the memory of Russia's great victory over fascism. The EU countries accept the persecution of the Russian-speaking communities because they want to erase from their memory the victory of the Soviet people over the Nazis, wrote the Russian press quoting a former deputy of the Supreme Rada, a member of the Party of Regions of the fugitive Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. The narrative is part of a larger effort to present Russia's aggression in the region in recent years as a fight against fascism, being a ""continuation"" of the USSR's efforts. According to these narratives, in 1939 the USSR liberated Poland and saved it by the Nazi genocide, following the ""liberation"" of the other states in Eastern Europe. The date of publishing:

This was published while Russia massed soldiers and equipment at the border with Ukraine, a fact that caused the concern of the international community.
NEWS: ,,...Russia can no longer afford ambiguities, lack of understanding, reluctance - the new threats, even if they are a continuation of the existing ones, require some harsh reactions. As the president stated clearly enough during the meeting of the Ministry of Defense collegium: ""Do they think that we do not notice the threats? Or do they think that we will passively assist in the creation of new threats for Russia? This is the whole problem - we have nowhere to hide we keep moving - that's the problem""...
... We are not only a successor and descendant of historical Russia in all its forms and stages (from Kievan Russia to the USSR), but we are this Russia. And in this capacity we draw a concrete red line in front of our historical opponent, the so-called West. In this way, we make it clear that we have no intention of giving in or withdrawing - neither after Brest, nor from the Dnieper, temporarily lost. After the publication of the draft agreements, a new commotion broke out about Putin's plans to rebuild the USSR - but we don't need the reanimation of what died, we want to build something new. But on the same territories, which are part of the Russian world, of Russian influence, of Russian space. The death of the USSR was not able to cancel and did not cancel this fact - now we are just bringing it to the attention of the whole world.
... The general weakening and crisis of the West, the failure of its global project - that is, the Atlanticists simply no longer have enough forces to keep foreign territories in their sphere of influence, they cannot transform the temporary border between the West and Russia into one permanent...
Now Putin presented the West with a simple condition - to recognize not only Russia's right to existence and security, but also our right to a future. This will be impossible without restoring at least the geopolitical unity of historical Russia - and the countermeasures resorted to by the West represent nothing but a threat to our very existence..."" NARRATIVES: 1. Russia has the right to the territories lost after the collapse of the USSR. 2. The former republics are part of the Russian world, and the disappearance of the USSR did not cancel the right to them. 3. The West threatens Russia's existence. 4. The West is in crisis and its global project - a failure.
CONTEXT: Russia has massed significant forces at the border with Ukraine, a fact that caused the concern of the international community. Against the backdrop of this impressive deployment of troops and the danger of an attack on Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that he will force the West and NATO to respect the ""red lines"" and demand security guarantees from the USA.
In the opinion of Vladimir Putin, who has been in power for over 20 years, ""the collapse of the USSR was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century. Despite the links that remained after the collapse of the USSR, the Kremlin failed to maintain relations qualitative, based on the principle of equality and mutual respect with the former Soviet republics, but rather it was imposed through relations of domination, economic and energy blackmail, embargoes, threats, fueling secessionist forces and even armed conflicts. These intensified especially in the context the approach of the former Soviet republics to the European Union. The annexation of Crimea, in 2014, and the war in Donbas, were provoked by the Russian Federation after the population of Ukraine demonstrated massively against President Victor Yanukovych, who refused to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union. The occupation of the Crimean peninsula and the creation of the two separatist republics in Eastern Ukraine is part of the Novorossia project, which involved the extension to Odessa and the border with the Republic of Moldova (including Transnistria). After the events in Ukraine, the Baltic States expressed fears about a new Russian occupation. Previously, in 2008, in Georgia, which has two separatist republics on its territory, Ossetia and Abkhazia, the Russian-Georgian war took place, when Russian troops arrived close to the capital Tbilisi. And the Republic of Moldova, for 30 years, is facing a frozen conflict in the Transnistrian region, the separatist regime from Tiraspol being supported politically and financially by the Kremlin, which also has armed forces in the area despite Chisinau's repeated requests that they be withdrawn .
The actions on the border with Ukraine and the statements of the Russian president come against the background of the fall in the rating of Vladimir Putin and his ruling party, in the conditions where the opposition in Russia has been eliminated, the inconvenient press closed or declared a ""foreign agent"", as well as well as civil society organizations.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to emphasize the former republics' belonging to the Russian space and world and Russia's right over these territories.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The centuries-old belonging of the countries of the former USSR to the Russian world and the common history to which the author refers are the result of Russian expansionism, being different peoples and invaded and occupied territories where the occupying power sought to impose its language and culture. It is therefore a false membership, used to justify the political and domination interests of the Russian Federation. The narratives are part of the Kremlin's efforts to maintain its influence in the former states that broke away from the USSR 30 years ago. The USSR was a totalitarian state, which forcibly included territories in its composition.
Regarding the narrative that Russia has the right to these territories that would be part of the Russian world and Russian space and that the disappearance of the USSR did not cancel this fact, this is misinformation. The declarations of independence of the former Soviet republics in 1991, their sovereignty and territorial integrity were recognized by the Russian Federation and the international community (UN).
The narrative regarding the threat of the West ""to the very existence"" of Russia is also a false one. No country from the West and NATO has attacked and does not intend to attack the Russian Federation. On the contrary, Russia attacked Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia in 2008, and the requests their desire to join NATO intensified precisely in this context. Publication / Media:

NEWS: ""Journalist Iosefina Pascal, who stood out for her investigations regarding the guns given during the pandemic either at the national level or even at the European level, was picked up and taken to the police last night after she participated in the protests at the Parliament. The announcement was made by Sorin Rosca Stanescu on YouTube.""
NARRATIVE: 1. The police state in Romania detained a journalist at a protest. 2. Freedom of expression is violated in Romania.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On December 21, at the Palace of the Parliament there was a protest attributed to AUR and partially assumed by this formation - its representatives stated that some of the demonstrators were not summoned by them - after which the entrance was forced in the courtyard of the building, several cars, including one belonging to the US embassy, ​​were vandalized. Following these incidents, the Romanian authorities launched an investigation to identify and hold the culprits accountable, and as part of the investigation, Iosefina Pascal, presented as a journalist for the Gold FM radio station, was summoned to give clarifications.
The announcement regarding the detention of Iosefina Pascal was made by Sorin Rosca Stanescu, who was sentenced to prison in a case in which he was accused, among other things, of ""forming an organized criminal group"". Sorin Rosca Stanescu was also involved in politics and , previously, he was a journalist, the press raising a series of question marks on the way he carried out his activity.
Iosefina Pascal is also intensively promoted by the spokesperson of the Kremlin, Sputnik, which placed her on the 2nd place in its top of the Romanian media for 2021. On the third place of this Sputnik top is the controversial politician and self-titled analyst Cosmin Gusa; his son is the official owner of the Gold FM station, for which Iosefina Pascal allegedly worked as a reporter covering the protest at the Palace of Parliament.
Iosefina Pascal has been presented as a journalist for a relatively short time. She was previously described as a fashion designer and assistant to former deputy and MEP Maria Grapini. Pascal stood out by promoting conspiracy theories and false narratives regarding the Covid pandemic and was also described as the organizer of one of the first anti-Covid demonstrations in 2020.
OBJECTIVE: To discredit the Romanian state. The victimization of Iosefina Pascal, but also her legitimization and, implicitly, the theories she supports.
WHY IS THE NARRATIVE FALSE: Iosefina Pascal was invited to the Police headquarters, along with other people, to provide information about the events at the Parliament, she ""accepted"" to go, and after ""it was settled"" she was present at the events at the Parliament, as a journalist, in order to produce a press material [...] she left the headquarters of the General Directorate of Police of the Municipality of Bucharest in a short time"", according to a press release from the DGPMB .

NEWS: Ukraine is not a NATO member. Not being a NATO member, the organization's member states have no reason to retaliate. Therefore, Vladimir Putin can decide what he wants. Without risking any military response. And comes the dressing on the wound. In the sense that, if the Russian Federation invades Ukraine, occupies it and annexes it, it assumes a different kind of consequences.

In a few days, Romania could be left with its eyes in the sun. Offside. And then what will we do? Will we abandon the many military toys located in Ukraine, as if they did not represent anything? Will we abandon our soldiers and specialists displaced there, as if they had not served the colors of the country?

NARRATIVES: 1. Romania deployed forces and equipment in Ukraine. 2. Romania will be abandoned by NATO when Russia attacks Ukraine, and Bucharest will lose the soldiers and equipment sent to this country.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In recent months, Russia has mobilized significant forces at the borders of Ukraine, which has led to an increase in tensions in an already tense climate. Moscow is trying to force the West's hand and impose a series of ""conditions"" so that Ukraine is not accepted into NATO and remains in Moscow's sphere of influence. Ukraine's right to self-determination is ignored by the Russian side. The list of conditions Moscow includes the prohibition of any expansion of NATO and the establishment of American military bases in all states of the former Soviet space, but also ""the abandonment of any military activity of NATO in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia"".
Romania hosts soldiers and American military equipment in three military bases: at Desevelu in Olt county, where the anti-missile shield is located, in the Kogalniceanu military base in Constanta county and at the Campia Turzii air base in Cluj county.
At the same time, Romania, like its NATO allies and European partners, repeatedly expressed its support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and firmly condemned the occupation and annexation of Crimea by Russia. On the other hand, just like other states in the region, Bucharest was concerned about Russia's increasingly pronounced militarism.
OBJECTIVE: Manipulating public opinion that Romania will be abandoned by its military allies in the event of a conflict.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: First of all, the statements in the Evenimentul Zilei article, according to which Romania has deployed troops or sent military instructors to Ukraine, are completely false. Also, Romania does not have any kind of combat equipment currently deployed on the territory of Ukraine.
According to an answer given by the Ministry of National Defense to a truthful question, ""Romania has not carried out and is not carrying out missions or actions in Ukraine of the kind suggested in the article you refer to"".
MApN specified that the Romanian-Ukrainian cooperation relations in the field of defense take place transparently, bilaterally, in regional formats, as well as within international organizations, especially under the auspices of the North Atlantic Alliance, based on the NATO-Ukraine Partnership.
""Bilaterally, the cooperation between the two armies is realized through joint training actions, which take place on the territory of Romania or the territory of Ukraine, in the framework of bilateral or international exercises planned and communicated in a transparent manner. Details about these exercises can be found on the website of the Ministry of National Defense, by consulting the archive of communiqués issued by the institution"", states the press office of the Ministry of Defense.
Moreover, the military relations between Romania and Ukraine take place within the parameters of a government-level agreement in the field of technical-military cooperation, signed at the level of the Ministries of Defense by the two countries on September 5, 2020.
""The agreement will contribute to the strengthening of bilateral cooperation by creating the legal framework necessary for institutions and economic agents from the two countries for the development of joint projects in areas such as the acquisition, repair and modernization of armaments and military equipment, research and development in the technical field -military and the exchange of information and experience in the standardization, codification and quality control of military equipment,"" MApN representatives also told Veridica.ro.
Regarding the alleged abandonment of Romania by NATO, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty talks about the principle of common defense, so that any attack on one of the members of the Alliance will be considered an attack on NATO in corpore, and all signatory members have the obligation to intervene in the defense of the attacked state.
TRUTH: The British Minister of Defense, Ben Wallace, recently declared that it is ""extremely unlikely"" that London and its allies will intervene militarily in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Publication / Media:

380,883,Great Britain wants the NATO states to admit that they are responsible for the crisis in Ukraine,Great Britain asks NATO to take responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine,False,[],"['Great Britain', 'NATO', 'Ukraine']",,,,,,,https://ria.ru/20211216/rusofobiya-1763980865.html,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-marea-britanie-vrea-ca-statele-nato-sa-admita-ca-sunt-responsabile-de-criza-din-ucraina,,21.12.2021,,Ukraine,veridica,https://www.veridica.ro/stiri-false/fake-news-marea-britanie-vrea-ca-statele-nato-sa-admita-ca-sunt-responsabile-de-criza-din-ucraina,,"Great Britain demanded that NATO admit responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine and admitted the destabilizing actions of the West, the Russian government press claims. The false narrative starts from an obscure British publication, with no connection to government sources.
NEWS: Great Britain calls on the West to take full responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine. Politicians have built a world in which there are good and peaceful states from the West, against which Russia acts, which ""destroys"" and sows chaos. This approach, however, hides the actions of NATO states, which are dangerous and destabilize the situation on the globe, writes the magazine British ""Spiked""
[...]
In reality, Russia is not the main actor and cannot be considered an agent of chaos. On the contrary, everything that takes place in Ukraine and around it is a result of Moscow's older fear of Western expansion. If we observe a destructive and destabilizing force here, we must recognize that it is not the Kremlin, but NATO.
[...]
Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov mentioned that the number of western instructors has increased in Donbass. From this point of view, the Ukrainian power can be provoked to organize ""military adventures"", which will represent a direct danger to Russia's security.
NARRATIVE: Great Britain asks NATO to take responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and supported the separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, which turned into a bloody conflict that caused over 13 thousand deaths. Despite the numerous protests of the international community and the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West, Moscow not only did not stop financing the mercenaries in eastern Ukraine, but also initiated a gradual integration of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk (DNR and LNR) into the Russian Federation . The process of granting Russian citizenship was launched first, followed by a decision by President Vladimir Putin to develop commercial relations with the self-proclaimed republics.
At the beginning of November, Russia was accused, for the second time this year, of mobilizing soldiers and equipment near its border with Ukraine, raising the concern of some officials from Ukraine, the USA and the EU.
NATO and the EU have warned Moscow of the ""serious consequences"" in the event of a military intervention in Ukraine, after rejecting Russia's ""veto"" on the possible accession of Kiev to the Alliance. The 27 EU heads of state and government adopted in Brussels, after a few hours of discussions behind closed doors, some possible economic sanctions aimed at discouraging Russia's military actions.
In response, the Kremlin claims that it has the right to deploy troops on its territory wherever it deems appropriate, and the Russian government press promoted false narratives, analyzed by Veridica.ro, about the Kremlin, which would have had to mobilize its forces at the border with Ukraine to defend itself from a NATO aggression.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to convince Russian-speaking readers from Russia and the former Soviet states that the crisis in Ukraine is a consequence of the destabilizing actions of NATO members, exonerating Moscow.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, there is no question of any request by Great Britain to the NATO states to recognize or assume any responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine. RIA Novosti cites a not very well-known British magazine (""Spiked"", accused in 2020 of distributing fake news about the Near East, Turkey and NATO), it is the opinion of Tim Black, an author who has also distinguished himself through anti-Western narratives and pro-Russian on the page of the same publication. For example, Black also wrote that Great Britain is Russophobic and criticized the opposition in Russia.
A series of articles by this author are strikingly similar to Moscow's official narratives in the hybrid war that Russia is waging against the EU and NATO states. Regardless of the independent or less independent opinion of the author of the article published on ""Spiked"", this cannot be considered as the position of Great Britain, as RIA Novosti falsely claims, taken over by dozens of Russian news portals!
This manipulation technique has been used by the Russian government media in the past. In October, RIA Novosti wrote about European citizens requesting the construction of Nord Stream 3 and 4 to overcome the gas crisis, quoting a comment from the bottom of a study from Germany, published in the newspaper ""Die Zeit"". RIA Novosti then generalized the opinion of a single reader and presented it as a dominant idea in Germany and the EU - fake news analyzed by Veridica.ro.
Regarding the article in the ""Spiked"" magazine, RIA Novosti applies the same manipulation technique, transforming some theses from an article, signed by a little-known author, into noisy press headlines with the aim of convincing the public opinion in Russia that Moscow's actions regarding Ukraine are absolutely correct. The narrative in question has been promoted on several pages of the Moscow-controlled media. In other words, Britain has not criticized NATO for its policy towards Ukraine, on the contrary, it has recently declared that it will help Ukraine to modernize the naval fleet, in the context of tensions with Russia.
At the end of the article, RIA Novosti journalists quote the Russian foreign minister, who resumed another narrative about NATO and the US, which, apparently, could organize an aggression in Donbass. In reality, Russia is the one that invaded and occupied Crimea, supported the separatist movements in Donbass by violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, being declared an ""aggressor state"" by the Kyiv Parliament. These facts, however, recognized by the community international, are not mentioned by the Russian government press, but the opinions of a dubious British journalist about NATO's ""guilt"" are quoted without proving any evidence.
As Veridica has already shown, it is not in the interest of Ukraine or the West to have a hotbed of conflict in Donbass. Any conflict inhibits economic development, blocks the free exchange of goods, capital and labor, which cannot be in the interest of any state. The West did not encourage the conflict, but on the contrary, through the sanctions imposed on Russia, through the creation of negotiation formats such as the Minsk platform, which stopped the conflict in 2014-2015, it tried to regulate the conflict through a diplomatic and political dialogue. The interest of the West is the establishment of peace and the cancellation of all sanctions that block several areas of cooperation between Western economic entities and those in Russia.

The comment starts from an article with similar narratives published by the Armenian portal verelq.am, which, in turn, quotes Dalma News, a media institution from the Caucasus region.
NEWS: ""The network of non-governmental organizations created in Moldova by Western states played a key role in the early parliamentary elections, after which power in the country passed entirely into the hands of the pro-Western Action and Solidarity Party. The political NGOs, financed from the West, were directly involved in the campaign, on the side of the pro-Western politicians. And there is nothing surprising - the president Maia Sandu and her formation, PAS, come from the ranks of NGOs and fulfill their orders. Moldova is in fact in the situation of being ""softly"" occupied by NGOs, whose activity undermines the foundations of the nation and the Moldovan statehood.
[...]
""The political system and political parties in the Republic of Moldova mentioned being controlled, to a large extent, by international sponsors"".
[...]
And today, only a few political parties are ready to resist this occupation and fight for the real independence of their country"" NARRATIVES: 1. The West put control over the Republic of Moldova through non-governmental organizations. 2. NGOs undermine the stability and independence of the Republic of Moldova.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: In the Republic of Moldova, a real ""witch hunt"" has recently started against civil society on the part of some representatives of the political left. The start was given by the socialist deputy Bogdan Tirdea, who launched last October, in full electoral campaign for the presidential elections, a book whose main narratives are that civil society in the Republic of Moldova is an instrument in the hands of the West, which imposes, through it, its control and its values, which, in turn, undermine those traditional Moldovan values, such as language, neutrality, Orthodoxy, etc.
Such messages periodically appear in some press institutions from the Republic of Moldova, being fueled by the statements of some socialist leaders, in parallel with other narratives such as the intention of the West to involve the Republic of Moldova in a war with Russia, or the total control that exercise over the government from Chisinau.
The messages were amplified after the victory of PAS in the anticipated parliamentary elections of July 2021, trying to accredit the idea that the victory obtained by Maia Sandu and PAS in the last two elections does not represent the will of the citizens, but is the result of the direct involvement of the West.
OBJECTIVE: Discredit the pro-European government and civil society in the Republic of Moldova. The inoculation of the idea that the Republic of Moldova is led from the outside, at the expense of its own interests. Feeding phobias towards the West. Promotion of left-wing, pro-Russian parties, as the only ones acting in the interests of the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The purpose of civil society is to promote and contribute to the development of democratic values, which, in turn, ensure the economic development of a state. In the Republic of Moldova, besides the fact that it provided tens of thousands of jobs and attracted funding from abroad, the civil society trained and educated numerous experts, came with expertise, studies and recommendations in different fields, intended to contribute to the development of the country.
Non-governmental organizations from the Republic of Moldova campaign for a democratic state and do not oppose its independence or sovereignty.
NUTS OF TRUTH: A large part of the non-governmental organizations in the Republic of Moldova are financed by Western international institutions, just like most of the NGOs in the entire region. Publication / Media:

The narratives were launched on the eve of the PaE Summit with the aim of undermining the joint efforts of the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia to get closer to the EU.
NEWS: The Ukrainian president is trying to put his partners in the Eastern Partnership in the shade and to force the EU to finance the ""or"" war, writes eNews.md. ""The December Summit of the Eastern Partnership must give new life to the organization on half dead, which was created exclusively as a ""buffer zone"" around Russia"", the publication writes. ""Moldova and Ukraine do not have any common agenda, including the European integration plan. Of course, if we are talking about a peaceful agenda, constructive, not about a new military confrontation, which Zelenski's administration is trying to trigger"". The author writes that ""Maia Sandu is going to Brussels to try to get some loans and grants to finance her reforms."" Also, for the stabilization of the economy, which is going downhill after President Sandu practically destroyed the republic's relations with Gazprom and caused an energy crisis"". The publication claims that the Ukrainian president has another agenda in Brussels, ""because he is interested the war and the confrontation, which he intends to maintain with the support of the European Union"" and that the Summit could fail because of Zelenski.
NARRATIVES: 1. The Eastern Partnership Summit will be a failure because Zelenski wants to drag the EU into a war. 2. Moldova and Ukraine do not have a common European integration agenda. 3. Maia Sandu needs European credits to stabilize the economy, after destroying relations with Gazprom and causing an energy crisis.
CONTEXT: On December 15, 2021, the Eastern Partnership Summit took place in Brussels, a European Union project that includes six ex-Soviet states. The Republic of Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan participated in the event. Belarus has suspended its participation in the EaP, but the EU announces that it continues to support and cooperate with the Belarusian people.
The EU summit with the countries of the Eastern Partnership confirms the European Union's support for the European integration of these countries, according to the joint declaration adopted at the end of the event. At the same time, the participating countries expressed their deep concern regarding the continued destabilization and persistent violations of the principles of international law in many parts of the Eastern Partnership region, which represent a threat to peace, security and stability, and requested the renewal of efforts to promote the peaceful resolution of unresolved conflicts in the Eastern Partnership region based on the principles and norms of international law.
At the same time, the EU recognizes the initiative of the trio of associated partners (Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine) to strengthen their cooperation with the EU.
The economic investment plan within this Partnership provides for the improvement of connectivity and the anchoring of the Republic of Moldova in the trans-European transport network and the increase of the energy efficiency of social buildings. In Brussels, the representatives of the EU and the Republic of Moldova signed the financing agreement in the amount of 60 million euros, money intended to reduce the impact of the increase in gas prices on the population. The financing agreement completes the economic recovery package of 600 million euros, offered by the EU to the Republic of Moldova in the next three years. Also, the necessary agreements were signed for the implementation of the ""Energy Efficiency in the Republic of Moldova"" project. It involves two loans of 30 million euros each from the EIB and the EBRD, and a grant of 2.8 million from the Platform for Investments for the Neighborhood of the European Commission and from the Fiduciary Fund for technical assistance for the PaE countries. The Letter of Intent regarding the EIB's willingness to grant a loan of up to 150 million euros for the rehabilitation of 150 kilometers of roads was also signed.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives were launched on the eve of the Eastern Partnership Summit with the aim of diminishing the importance of the event and the joint efforts of the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia to get closer to the European Union. At the same time, the publication tries to associate the energy crisis and the complicated economic situation in the Republic of Moldova with the mandate of the president Maia Sandu and to minimize the aid granted by the EU.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Indeed, the summit was dominated by security issues in the Eastern Partnership region, but this agenda was not determined by the actions of Ukraine, but by those of Russia, which has massed numerous troops on the Eastern border of Ukraine. Ukraine is facing a war in the Donbass region, started and supported by Russia in 2014, after another Ukrainian region, the Crimean peninsula, was annexed by Russia, a crime condemned by the international community. Ukraine has not launched any military campaign against another country, but is trying to free its territory from separatists and Russian-funded fighters in the two breakaway republics. The narratives that Ukraine is guilty of the military conflict in Donbass are part of an intense disinformation campaign by the Russian Federation in the context of the hybrid war against Ukraine. According to the Kremlin's propaganda machine, the ""peoples of Crimea and Donbass"" fight against the Ukrainian ""junta"" and ""fascists"", and Russian troops would defend the population.
Regarding the narrative that Ukraine and Moldova do not have a common European integration agenda, this is contradicted by the Trio Asociat initiative, through which Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia declared their joint efforts to promote their European aspirations. This initiative, coming from Kiev, was recognized by the leaders of the EU member states and those of the European institutions. In a joint Declaration of the heads of state and government of the Associated Trio - the Republic of Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine - regarding the sixth Summit of the Eastern Partnership, the signatories recognized ""the need to strengthen the cooperation of the Associated Trio with the EU, having with the aim of increased coordination regarding matters of common interest related to the promotion of European integration, including the recognition by the EU of the European perspective of the Associated Trio"".
The statement that Maia Sandu is going to Brussels to obtain loans and grants for ""stabilizing the economy, which is going downhill after President Sandu practically destroyed the republic's relations with Gazprom and caused an energy crisis"" is also false. At the Eastern Partnership Summit several documents were signed that provide for European funding for the Republic of Moldova, which, indeed, will contribute to the stabilization of the economy. The precarious economic situation of the Republic of Moldova was not caused by Maia Sandu, but by the previous governments that mismanaged the state from an economic point of view, due to corruption in the political and administrative system at all levels, due to the black economy, massive migration from Moldova, etc. The economic crisis was also deepened by the Covid pandemic, which affected several branches of this field The energy crisis was caused by the increase in the price of natural gas on the international markets, and in this context the Russian Federation once again used Gazprom to put political pressure on the pro-European government in Chisinau. This political weapon has also been used by the Russian Federation in relation to the Republic of Moldova, which is almost entirely dependent on Russian energy resources. In the context of the proximity of Chisinau to Brussels, previously, Russia also introduced embargoes on Moldovan wines and agri-food products exported to this country. Publication / Media:

They did it in 1980 and will repeat it in 2022, according to a false narrative promoted by Sputnik.
NEWS: ""Announcing the boycott of the 80 Olympics, the White House understood very well that the Moscow authorities would respond symmetrically. Thus, the Olympic cycle, barely restored after the Second World War, was interrupted.
[...]
So, let's see where the subject of the boycott as well as the use of Olympic sports as a political weapon has its roots.
40 years ago, the administration of Democratic President Jimmy Carter resorted to boycotting the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics.
In this way, Washington decided to ""penalize"" the USSR for the fact that Moscow, intending to defend including its own southern borders, introduced a limited military contingent into Afghanistan.
Today obviously this boycott, against the background of a chaotic and bloody withdrawal of the United States from the country, looks like a comical declamation, but then the athletes from the countries that silently followed the American ideological line, did not laugh at all. The hard work during the entire Olympic cycle, when the athlete reaches the peak of form at the competitions, was thrown into the trash with a single stroke of the pen.
[...]
Today, all kinds of political perverts, by virtue of their own pettiness, mental laziness and, ultimately, their own stupidity, try to destroy these traditions, which they did not create, and which should survive (theoretically) these temporary masters.
Optimism inspires us in history: the boycott of the 80 Olympics did not allow Washington to accumulate any political bonus.
Instead, in an attempt to oppose the Soviet military presence, the US raised Osama bin Laden with its own hands and money.
Everyone remembers how that ended.
As if this tragedy wasn't enough, Washington added a farce (just as bloody) on top of it, when it defeated the refugees from Afghanistan. [...]"" NARRATIVES: 1. The USSR did not invade Afghanistan, but only introduced a ""limited military contingent"" into that country. 2. The USSR behaved impeccably in Afghanistan, and the USA destroyed that country. 3. The JO boycott is a political action. unilateral US action that has no results 4. Just like in 1980, the US is now trying to destroy the Olympics, but this time the goal is to impose transgender athletes.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The United States and several of their allies (Great Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.) have decided to diplomatically boycott the Winter Olympics. This basically means that officials from the respective countries will not participate in the opening ceremony of the Games, but the Olympic teams will be present. Likewise, the decision to diplomatically boycott the Games has no impact on the companies that sponsor the participating athletes.
The decision to diplomatically boycott the Olympic Games is a reaction to China's severe slippages in the province of Xinjiang and in Hong Kong. Human rights organizations and Western governments have been denouncing the Chinese campaign against Muslims in Xinjiang for years, where re-education camps were allegedly set up and massive human rights violations were recorded. The United Nations raised the alarm in this regard and is going to publish a report on the abuses committed. Beijing is also behind a strong campaign to limit the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens, which should have been respected according to the ""one country, two systems"" agreement that has been the basis of the province's governance since it returned in the Chinese component.
Beijing rejects any criticism of its abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, invokes the principle of ""non-interference in internal affairs"" and threatens retaliation for the boycott.
The attention that liberal democracies pay to respecting citizens' rights and liberties also irritates Russia, which also has an authoritarian regime, so the Kremlin's propaganda also emphasizes ""non-interference in internal affairs"". Russia is also irritated by the fact that the athletes do not have the right to participate in these Olympic Games under the flag or because of the numerous doping scandals involving Russian athletes.
Boycotting the Olympic Games is nothing new. The most famous example dates from the period of the Cold War when, as a result of the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR, more than 60 countries chose not to participate in the Olympic Games in Moscow. As retaliation, the USSR responded with its own boycott, at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, but only part of the socialist countries (the exceptions being China, Romania and Yugoslavia) and a few client states of the USSR joined it. There are other cases of boycotts, including from China, which refused to participate in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.
OBJECTIVE: Shifting attention from the real causes of the boycotts - the invasion of another state, in 1980, the violation of human rights, in 2022.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The 1980 Olympic Games were boycotted by dozens of Western countries, led by the United States, in response to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. The USSR did not ""introduce a limited military contingent"" to Afghanistan to defend its southern border; it invaded an independent state after the pro-Moscow communists who had staged a coup d'état (and provoked a revolt of the national forces and the Islamists moderates) lost power. In fact, long before it was invaded by the Soviets, Afghanistan had represented one of the targets of the imperial ambitions of the Russians, the country being throughout the entire 19th century in the center of the so-called ""Great game"", a Russian-British dispute that started from the idea that whoever controls Afghanistan controls Central Asia. The Soviet invasion caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan, with 5 million refugees and up to 2 million dead, and the Soviet withdrawal took place following the loss of the war and was followed shortly by the collapse of the USSR.
The mujahedin groups that emerged as a reaction to the Soviet invasion entered into civil war after the collapse of the Najibullah regime, a client of Moscow, and against the backdrop of that chaos, the Taliban emerged and were successful, which later hosted Al Qaeda. The United States offered support to the anti-Soviet Mujahideen in the context of the Cold War (but the money was directed by the Pakistani intelligence services), but after the Soviet withdrawal the flow of money stopped; it can therefore be said that a large part of Afghanistan's problems, including the emergence of the Taliban, are directly related to the Soviet invasion.
The false narrative regarding the founding of Al Qaeda by the Americans is old and has no factual basis; bin Laden arrived in Afghanistan as a financier of Abdullah Azzam's network, which he later took over and transformed into Al Qaeda.
The 1980 Moscow Olympics were boycotted by dozens of countries, not just the United States, and one of the most vocal supporters of the boycott was the Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov; his pleas played a decisive role in imposing the boycott. Politically, the massive boycott represented a hard blow for the USSR, which would collapse only a decade after the OJ.
The 2022 diplomatic boycott has nothing to do with gender ideology or the issue of trans-gender athletes, being strictly a reaction to the abuses committed by China in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Publication / Media:

The simple, firm and clear intervention of the two co-presidents of a parliamentary party, which is the main political opposition force in Romania, is a brave and unique act, which announces major changes in Romanian politics [...] What we are asking for is a the right business, which involves compensation through the offset mechanism as much as possible. We want to see military equipment produced in Romania, by Romanian arms. We want 80 percent of the money invested to return to the country!"" [...] ,,We are too poor to afford cheap things. We could buy 10 new planes, instead of 32 old ones, and we could negotiate much better ""said senator Claudiu Tarziu, co-president of AUR"", writes Sputnik. NARRATIVES: 1. Romania is a second-hand NATO state that ""pays the tribute"" by purchasing second-hand equipment. 2. Romania's military industry does not benefit from the purchase of second-hand multirole aircraft. 3. Romania they could have purchased fewer planes, but we.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETOS: Romania announced at the end of the week that it will purchase 32 F-16 multi-role aircraft from the Norwegian Army in order to form several aircraft squadrons capable of ensuring the security of the national airspace and, at the same time, of NATO in its eastern flank.
The acquisitions, which are added to the F-16 aircraft previously purchased from Portugal, are part of an effort to equip the Romanian aviation with high-performance combat equipment, the final objective of which is to access, towards the horizon of 2030, the fifth-generation American aircraft of the F-35 type, considered some of the most performing in the field of military aviation at the moment and the basic air platform of NATO for the next decades.
However, before reaching a flotilla of F-35, Romania must also develop capacity, and this is the key element from which the real price of the devices is calculated. Capability means, among other things, airports for specific aircraft models, silos, maintenance, training of specialized personnel. The existence of the capability leads, for example, to lower costs when additional devices are purchased, but also an easier subsequent transition to new platforms. The stage in which Romania is equipped with the F-16 is, therefore, a transitional one, which prepares the equipment with the F-35.
The consolidation of the Romanian Air Force and their equipment to NATO standards is imposed by Romania's membership in the North Atlantic Alliance and by the need to be able to protect its own territory, but it becomes all the more important in the context of Russia's increased aggression in the region in recent years.
Russia's increasingly pronounced militarism in the Black Sea and on the borders of Ukraine has put NATO on guard, especially the member states on the eastern flank and those bordering the Black Sea that feel threatened by Moscow's military resurgence.
The Eastern European states are following more and more closely the movements of Russian troops in the area, especially after the annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 by the ""little green men"" subordinate to Moscow, so that within NATO the dynamics for the investment by each state of 2% of GDP in the defense sector to be able to face potential threats either from Russia or other parts of the world.
OBJECTIVE: To create an anti-NATO feeling in Romania with extension towards a similar feeling towards the EU and the West in general.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Romania is a state with equal rights within NATO, and Article 5 of the North Atlantic Alliance Treaty refers to collective defense - the musketeer principle - that all member states intervene in the event of an attack on one of the allies. So, we cannot talk about second-hand states or ""garbage pits"" of NATO.
Moreover, more developed states help smaller states, and the regular air police mission that certain states carry out for others is the expression and proof of ""Article 5"" in peacetime. In the absence of a high-performance and modern air fleet, Romania benefits for years of air protection from the NATO states in the framework of air missions by rotation in the air base in Constanta county from Mihail Kogalniceanu.
Norway's fleet of 32 multi-role aircraft will cost only 365 million euros (compared to 628 million for the 17 aircraft previously purchased from Portugal), and another 100 million will be invested in the refurbishment of the aircraft at Aerostar Bacau, while AUR co-leader George Simion stated that the investments will not remain in Romania either. Furthermore, Norway's planes benefited from a substantial upgrade in 2001.
The 32 devices that Romania would buy from Norway are in the M6.5.2 configuration, superior to the one that the devices already in the fleet of the Romanian Air Force have - M5.2R. Romania's 17 current aircraft would also be upgraded to Aerostar M.6.X standard in the near future.
According to the Minister of Defense, Vasile Dancu, they would be used for another 10 years, so their life resource has not been exhausted. For the most part, the modernization of the new planes will be done by the Norwegian side in the next two years at Aerostar Bacau. In addition, all systems will then be perfected in the United States.
,, Airplanes are not like cars. With airplanes, the resource is constantly being renewed, it is not like other things. Then we have a sum of 100 million to modernize all the systems, it is done in the United States, because it is compatible with NATO"", said Dancu on Radio Romania Actualitati.
Moreover, this resource of about 10 years will allow Romania to switch to F-35 type aircraft.
""So these planes make the transition from the fourth generation to the fifth generation, the F-35, which we are talking about and which will be the planes of the future. Many of the components of these planes, even if these planes were used, are components that do what that last dreamed plane, which is in the works now - the F-35 does. This will happen in the next decade, probably after 2030, we will access the purchase of that type of plane, which is of the highest standard and for aviators it is a dream"", said Dancu.
The decision to consolidate the air fleet by purchasing aircraft from Norway is part of the larger plan to build the capability. Since the summer of this year, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Viorel Pana, has declared that Romania intends to endow itself with V-generation aircraft starting from 2030. He gave assurances that until then, ""the transitional defense capacity will be ensured by the F-16"" and in the immediate following period a decision will be made regarding the acquisition of two more squadrons.
Related to the statements of the other co-leader of the AUR, Claudiu Tarziu, according to which Romania ""could have purchased 10 new planes instead of 32 old ones"", we have the example of Bulgaria which purchased, after receiving acceptance in July 2019 from the USA , eight new F-16 aircraft at a price of 1.7 billion dollars, that is, more than 212 million dollars a piece compared to about 11 million dollars a piece second-hand (without re-engineering) that Romania paid for F models -16 on the second hand from Norway.
The subordination of smaller countries from various alliances - whether we are talking about the EU or NATO - is one of the main grand narratives of Russian propaganda.

NEWS: ""In December, President Volodymyr Zelensky submitted five bills that should legalize dual citizenship for representatives of the Western diaspora and facilitate their access to leadership positions in Ukraine. At the same time, it is proposed to strengthen responsibility for dual citizenship [...] Zelensky's citizenship bills contain a series of discriminatory rules that allow American citizens to hold leadership positions, but not Ukrainians living in Donetsk. [...] The inhabitants of the Donbass region will not even be people of the second category, but of the third or fourth at the legislative level"", writes Ukraina.ru in an article that claims a true ethnic genocide following the adoption of these laws legislative initiatives.
""Such initiatives are, in principle, part of the outline of Kyiv's policy after Euromaidan, whose purpose is the politicization of citizenship and national identity. Only a person with pro-American or radical nationalist views should be considered Ukrainian or a full citizen of Ukraine to perpetuate the country's current anti-Russian course,"" according to the quoted source.
""Deprivation of liberty: Ukraine has declared war on the citizens of the Russian Federation"", writes the publication Izvestia, which specifies that, through these laws, Kiev intends to punish the Russian-speaking population. ""The authorities in Kiev have decided to declare war on the inhabitants of the Crimean Peninsula , as well as the residents of DNR and LNR. They did it, as expected, in a sophisticated, veiled way - wrapping the idea in an urgent citizenship bill,"" writes the news portal of the city of Sevastopol (Crimea) ForPost. ""Better not to risk it. One thing is certain, the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol, who value their freedom, should refrain from traveling to Ukraine. This opinion was expressed for ForPost by the head of the Working Group for international legal issues within the Permanent Mission of Crimea next to the president of the Russian Federation, Alexander Molohov. Due to the fact that the degree of insanity of the Ukrainian authorities is increasing, absolutely any resident of Crimea can be detained, regardless of their official status"". NARRATIVES: 1. Ukraine allows multiple citizenship to punish the population of Crimea and Donbass 2. Traveling on the territory of Ukraine is dangerous for the population of Crimea and Donbass, because anyone can be arrested without any guilt.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: After the Euromaidan in Kiev in 2013-2014, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and supported the separatist movements that triggered a bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine, resulting in more than 13 thousand deaths so far. The international community has repeatedly condemned these aggressive actions of Russia, which, according to the UN, the EU, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and other organizations, grossly violate the principles of international law. In the first phases of the conflict in Donbass, the self-proclaimed authorities of the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics (DNR, LNR) issued identity cards and local passports, not recognized internationally, and Russia granted Russian citizenship to all the residents of the annexed Crimea. In 2019, Moscow launched an extensive campaign to grant citizenship to the residents of the occupied Donbass, although at a discursive level it has never acknowledged that it is a party to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. This mass granting of Russian citizenship was condemned by the international community, but also by Ukraine, whose diplomats specified that the ""passportization"" of Donbass is a de facto and de jure recognition that Moscow is part of the conflict and a aggressor state.
As a reaction, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky submitted for the consideration of the Parliament of Ukraine some draft laws which aim, on the one hand, to protect the state from the security dangers caused by the mass granting of Russian citizenship to Ukrainians who remained against their will in Dobnass and Crimea and, on the other hand, to offer a solution to the problem of dual citizenship - legally prohibited, but ubiquitous in Ukrainian society.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives are promoted to cause fear of Ukraine in regions controlled by Moscow or separatists, but also to frustrate any efforts by Kiev to get closer to its citizens in those regions. At the same time, the campaign to demonize Ukraine continues, which, although it is the victim of Russia's aggression, is presented as the aggressor.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: In reality, the draft laws submitted for examination to the Supreme Rada (Unicameral Ukrainian Parliament) do not refer to the inhabitants of Donbass and Crimea. The purpose of the Ukrainian Presidency, according to an explanatory note, is to allow Ukrainians in the diaspora to obtain Ukrainian citizenship without renouncing the other citizenship. On the other hand, some sanctions are introduced for not declaring or obtaining the citizenship of another state, designated as an aggressor by the Parliament (Russia) or that acts against territorial integrity or is at war with Ukraine, being Ukrainian citizens who live at the time of face in the territories under the control of the Ukrainian government.
All the legislative innovations mentioned above do not refer to the Ukrainians from the occupied Donbass and the annexed Crimea, because there the granting of Russian citizenship took place without their will. Back in 2014, the Supreme Rada adopted a law that will not be amended by the new legislative projects, in which it is said that Ukraine does not recognize the documents issued by the Kremlin in Crimea. Therefore, it is not the fault of Ukrainian citizens that they were granted Russian citizenship through blackmail or without being asked.
In 2019, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine modified through a Government Ordinance the rules for entering its territory, a document that states that Ukraine does not recognize Russian documents, including those that prove Russian citizenship, in the case of Ukrainians from the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk . In the order mentioned above, the Ukrainian government drew up a list of the competent bodies in Russia that dealt with the issuance of passports for its citizens, mentioning that these documents will not be recognized as legal. In this way, Ukraine places the entire legal responsibility for granting Russian citizenship to Ukrainians from Donbass and Crimea on Russia as the occupying force, and not on its citizens. For these reasons, Ukrainians from Donbass and Crimea cannot be punished, fined, sentenced to prison, as the Russian press writes.
The thesis about the pursuit of Ukrainians arriving from Donbass and Crimea in the regions controlled by the Kiev government is not true either. The narrative in question is not argued, no concrete cases or evidence are provided, being a continuation of the meta-narrative about the ""genocide of Russophones"" and Kiev's Russophobia. Veridica analyzed an extensive disinformation campaign launched by the pro-Kremlin media in July-August this year. according to which the students who come from Crimea and Donbass risk being persecuted in Ukraine. Russia's goal is to frustrate any effort by Kiev to recover and reintegrate these territories. Publication / Media:

The misinformation tries to accredit the idea that the election represents a democratic exercise and to accredit the idea of ​​the legitimacy of Transnistria, an entity not recognized internationally.
NEWS: ""The authorities of the Republic of Moldova, in an attempt to serve the curators from the West, are ready to risk even the vital economic interests of their country.
A political-diplomatic conflict between Russia and Moldova continues to grow, provoked by the authorities of this Naravian republic.

""The Moldovan authorities, which obviously behave to the detriment of national interests, are not independent enough and are led by curators from abroad. They, in order to deepen the confrontation between Moldova and Russia, are ready to sacrifice the vital interests of this republic. This is the cost of submission to the West, a cost that will be paid by all the small European countries that have accepted the fatal dependence on the Anglo-Saxon world empire"" NARRATIVES: 1. The authorities in Chisinau insulted Russia, forbidding several Russian ""observers"" to monitor the voting from the left of the Dniester. 2. Chisinau acts, to the detriment of its own interests, at the behest of the West, which wants to torpedo the relations of the Republic of Moldova with Russia.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: On December 12, in the Transnistrian separatist region in the east of the Republic of Moldova (economically, politically and militarily supported by Moscow), elections were held for the position of ""president"". The vote was not recognized by Chisinau, which also sent a statement stating that ""this exercise is taking place outside the constitutional framework and contrary to the legislation in force of the Republic of Moldova"".
In the same statement, the Office for Reintegration within the Government urges the international partners ""to refrain from statements, media reports, designations of ""electoral observers"" or other actions and contacts with the exponents of Tiraspol on this subject, in order to exclude any legitimization of such the so-called ""elections"".
Such actions will be considered a defiance to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, as well as could have a counterproductive impact on the Transnistrian regulatory process"".
However, several representatives of non-governmental organizations close to the Kremlin, but even officials, including Russian deputies, went to the region as ""international observers"". However, four of them were denied access to the Republic of Moldova and were returned from the airport, an action that was presented in the media as an affront to Russia.
Romania, on the other hand, conveyed, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bucharest, that it ""does not recognize the legitimacy of the so-called elections"" in the Transnistrian region.
OBJECTIVE: To present the election in the Transnistrian separatist region as a legitimate one, monitored by international observers. To present the pro-European authorities in Chisinau as Russophobes and to blame them in the event of further deterioration of Chisinau-Moscow relations. To bring back to public attention the subject of the West's alleged control over the government in Chisinau.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Transnistrian separatist region proclaimed its independence in 1990, but this, like all the polls organized in the enclave, were not recognized internationally.
The authorities from Chisinau launched an appeal to the ""international partners"" to refrain from statements or contacts like the authorities from Tiraspol on this subject, emphasizing that such behavior could affect the negotiation process. The Republic of Moldova has blocked access to its territory - or expelled - Russian citizens who intended to monitor the elections in Transnistria precisely in order not to give them legitimacy. Chisinau only acted according to its interests, national legislation and the (unrecognized) international status of the Transnistrian region, its purpose therefore not being that to bring any affront to Russia.

The goal is to generate dissatisfaction with the PAS government, which benefited from a massive vote of the diaspora in the elections.
NEWS: Komsomolskaia Pravda writes that PAS deputy Radu Marian went to the USA for a meeting with representatives of the Moldovan diaspora. ""It seems that the topic of the discussion with the American diaspora was the situation in our country and how the people who left Moldova can contribute to change, for us, the ones who remained"", comments the publication. KP writes that the departures ""overseas, to the people who they preferred to live and pay taxes in another state, it is a PAS directive"". The publication mentions in this context that President Maia Sandu and Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita have stated several times that they will involve the diaspora in reforming the country and they wonder: ""why don't they like those who live in the country?"" How are the departed better? Are we dumber than immigrants? Don't we have the initiative?"". The newspaper writes that PAS considers those remaining in Moldova ""a herd for the vote"", that the government ""turned its face to the West, which it smiles at."" Respectively, he turned his back on us"". KP also notes that the citizens of Moldova are not trustworthy and that PAS has begun to prohibit and destroy the attachment, the predilection of the population for Russian culture. NARRATIVES: 1. The PAS government considers that the Moldovans in the diaspora are better than those who stayed in the country. 2. The PAS government is loyal to the West at the expense of Moldovan citizens. 3. PAS destroys the attachment of Moldovan citizens to Russian culture.
CONTEXT: PAS deputy, Radu Marian, was invited to the Moldovan-American Convention, an annual event organized by the Moldovan community in the USA and Canada.
Moldovans abroad participated massively in last year's presidential elections and this summer's parliamentary elections. In the presidential elections, a record number of people voted in the precincts outside the country - 160 thousand in the first round and 260 thousand in the second round, which represented approximately 15% of the total number of those who came to vote. 95% of the votes from the diaspora were for Maia Sandu. The electorate from the diaspora is mostly represented by young people who see their future with the European Union, and their vote was also expressed in the parliamentary elections for the pro-European parties. Therefore, we are talking about a pro-Western, pro-reform and generally young electorate.
The new administration from Chisinau took into account the role of the diaspora and tried to get closer to it and attract it to Moldova, including to participate in the government. Moreover, President Maia Sandu and Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita graduated from Harvard University and worked at the World Bank, and later returned to the Republic of Moldova to get involved in the governance process.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to arouse the discontent of the population towards the current government. At the same time, they are trying to discredit the diaspora, which massively supported the pro-European party in the elections.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The pro-European government in the Republic of Moldova, indeed, showed openness to the Moldovan citizens who went abroad and urged them to return home to get involved in the country's development. This does not mean, however, that he turns his back on those who remained in the Republic of Moldova. Most of the PAS deputies and members of the Gavrilita Government live in the Republic of Moldova and did not come from abroad to govern. People who work abroad are also citizens of the Republic of Moldova. In almost every Moldovan family, at least one member is working abroad. However, these citizens did not betray the Republic of Moldova as the publication tries to insinuate. On the contrary, for over two decades, money transfers from outside the country remain a significant source for the budget of the majority of the population and, at the same time, constitute 15 percent of the GDP of the Republic of Moldova. On the other hand, the state is facing the problem of aging and depopulation of the country, and the return home of Moldovan citizens and their involvement in the labor market and in the business area through investments in the economy represents a stimulus that these areas urgently need.
Regarding the narrative that the government looks towards the West at the expense of Moldovan citizens, this is a false one, because the EU is the main economic partner of the Republic of Moldova. Moldovan citizens benefit from a visa-free regime in European countries. Also, the Republic of Moldova is supported by the EU through various financial aid and development programs, for the benefit of its citizens. The EU offered vital support in combating the Covid pandemic, and in the recent energy crisis it allocated 60 million euros from which the Government will compensate citizens' bills for gas consumption.
Regarding the narrative that PAS ""destroys the acquired Russified reflexes"" of the population, habits and attachment to Russian culture, this is a speculative statement. The government has not shown any negative attitude towards ethnic Russians or Russian culture.
SAMBURE DE ADEVAR: PAS MP Radu Marian participated in the Moldovan-American Convention. President Maia Sandu and Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had meetings with representatives of the Moldovan diaspora from several countries.

NEWS: ,,[...] If you look carefully, you will see that there are approx. 4 million cases in total, most (approx. 1.8 million) being among socially and economically active people: 18-64 years !
While such adverse reactions are officially reported, and the expected effects are close to zero compared to the V wave, comfortably installed in the rich and ultra-""immunized"" West of Europe, the new strain/variant/pathogen being completely insensitive to the big experimental serums, everywhere in Europe, bureaucrats and politicians impose vaccination with the same useless and harmful serums, as the ""only solution"" against plandemia. Not only this is happening - new waves of restrictions are coming everywhere, and the health apartheid is becoming more and more ""normal"" and constraining, the normal world being thrown extra muros. It is cynical and irresponsible that, now, the ""immunization"" of children under 12 years old also becomes inevitable.""
NARRATIVE/NARRATIVES: 1. Anti-Covid vaccines have many serious adverse effects. 2. Anti-Covid vaccines are ""experimental serums"". 3. Anti-Covid vaccines are generally ineffective. 4. Anti-Covid vaccines have no effect against the Omicron variant. 5. Vaccinating children is cynical and irresponsible. 6 The anti-Covid restrictions have led to a sanitary ""apartheid"".
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The pandemic has led to the emergence of a wave of false narratives about the nature of the coronavirus, its virulence (a simple ""cold""), the source of SARS-CoV-2, the mode of spread, the effectiveness of anti-pandemic measures, the real reasons for their adoption, the treatments for Covid-19, etc. Only EUvsDisinfo, a platform specialized in combating disinformation, published in the last two years almost 1000 articles in which it dismantled different narratives associated with the pandemic; to these are added numerous materials appearing in the mass media from all over the world, interventions by experts and authorities, etc.
A separate category of false narratives are those that target anti-Covid vaccines, the main theses circulated being that they are experimental, ineffective or even harmful, or have different compounds, and here the narratives are adapted according to the audience to which they are addressed: for those willing to believe in fanciful conspiracies, microchips, for Muslims - pork products, forbidden by their religion, for fundamentalist Christians - human fetal cells, etc. False narratives regarding the vaccine are so widespread that there is even an article dedicated to them, without being exhaustive, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
The false narratives about the pandemic and vaccines have several sources. Russia has adapted its disinformation campaigns to the pandemic, the goal being, as before, to destabilize Western societies (which is why, for example, the Kremlin's propaganda undermines trust in vaccines externally but promotes them among Russians). China is a source of disinformation, its main purpose being to divert attention from the way it initially approached the pandemic and from the fact that SARS-CoV-2 appeared on its territory. Publications and so-called influencers from the West, usually from the area of ​​the radical right and conspiracists, are also sources of misinformation. These are taken over and spread by other ""influencers"", publications from all over the world or on social networks. There are several categories sensitive to such narratives and misinformation - corona-skeptics, anti-vaccinists, people who do not trust authorities etc. In many countries, real anti-restriction and anti-vaccine movements have appeared, strongly influenced by some of these narratives, which they take over, internalize and amplify.
And in Romania there are characters who are known for their opposition to anti-Covid measures and vaccines, as well as for spreading false narratives about them. One of these characters is the lawyer Gheorghe Piperea, who is regularly featured in articles on portals where, over time, Veridica has identified fake news and disinformation: Sputnik.md and ActiveNews.
OBJECTIVE: Undermining trust in vaccines and the effectiveness of anti-Covid measures.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: Narratives regarding alleged widespread adverse effects of vaccines are not new; on the contrary, they appear regularly, in different parts of the world. In general, it is based on the presentation of some data taken out of context and the erroneous interpretation of some statistics (either out of malice or amateurism). Data from the American system for reporting adverse effects have been used for disinformation (Science wrote about one in May, 2021, Reuters dismantled another in October), as well as those of the World Health Organization, as Politifact showed. Gheorghe Piperea refers, this time, to data from the European Medicines Agency, but on the respective page it is clearly specified, among other things, that ""Information on suspected side effects should not be interpreted as meaning that the medicine or its active substance produced the observed effect or that it cannot be used safely."", and in the disclaimer it is emphasized that ""The information on this website does not reflect any confirmation of a possible links between the drug and the effect(s) observed."". Therefore, the data are presented and interpreted without any scientific basis, but also without any context being presented - for example, what is the percentage of people who have presented adverse effects and, comparatively, what is the percentage of people who have adverse effects from other vaccines or medicines.
Vaccines are not ""experimental serums""; they have gone through a rigorous testing process before being approved as vaccines by international (WHO, European Medicines Agency) or national bodies.
In terms of the effectiveness of vaccines, they offer a degree of protection against infection with the new coronavirus, but it is not a 100% protection, as in the case of other vaccines or medicines. An additional advantage is given by the fact that even in the event of infection, the probability that infected people will develop mild forms of the disease is much higher, something proven by several studies, including one carried out in France on twenty-two million subjects, which showed that the probability of developing a severe form or dying is 90% lower in the case of those vaccinated. Regarding the Omicron version, the statement that it is ""completely insensitive"" to the vaccine has no scientific basis - too little time has passed since its appearance for there to be reliable data. There is a study, however, that shows that vaccination with the booster dose offers the same protection against Omicron as vaccination with two doses against other strains.
In addition, at this moment the effectiveness of the vaccines compared to Omicron is secondary, given that for now the dominant strain of wave 5, as well as wave 4, is Delta. Both variants - Delta and Omicron - as well as probable future variants show once more the importance of vaccination and restrictions, given that the more the coronavirus spreads (a phenomenon that can be stopped by immunization), the more the possibility of its occurrence increases new strains.
The decision to vaccinate children was also made only after a rigorous testing process and there is no data to show that the vaccine would be dangerous for the age groups for which it was approved.
The theory of ""sanitary apartheid"" belongs to the discourse of radical anti-vaccinists, who, in an attempt to demonize vaccines, apply political concepts to health policies, a phenomenon that also has the secondary effect of trivializing crimes and major political doctrines; apart from ""apartheid"" "", a segregation based on racial criteria intended to ensure the dominance of whites, between anti-vaccinists and corona skeptics there are also references to Nazi policies, used including by the lawyer Piperea who, in a material cited by Sputnik, catalogs the green certificate as ""Nazipass"".

Meanwhile, other countries have only to gain, according to a false narrative promoted by Sputnik.
NEWS: ""Mirel Palada ironizes Romania's colonial situation, showing that, while the surrounding countries are developing with Chinese investments, ""you are only allowed bears"".
He presents in a post on Facebook the inauguration of a railway between the capitals of two Balkan countries, Serbia (Belgrade) and Hungary (Budapest), with money put in by the Chinese and which continues to Bulgaria (Sofia, Varna) and to Greece (Thessaloniki , Athens).
And Palada explains, without hiding anything and without having any illusions, that the Chinese see their interests: they want to connect Piraeus, the Greek port related to the capital Athens, to the center of Europe: Budapest and from there Vienna and the rest.
What's in Piraeus? A port bought by the Chinese. A bridgehead in Europe, part of their strategic Silk Road project, through which to bring their goods more conveniently from here. Piraeus. Varna. Chess and go pieces on the geostrategic board of global money spinning. A lot of money [...] But, he continued, what did the Greeks and Hungarians do? They also saw their own interests, even if they are part of the European Union, they resisted the orders of the German Fuhrer, the true hegemon of Europe, who would have wanted the satellite states not to break their word and not to use money other than those given by Europe[...] Romanians deserve the best. Do you want highways? You will have a lot of highways. Go away, ma, with your stupid claims. On the scooter with you. Do you want a country like abroad? Only if you go abroad, brothers, to be servants of those in their country: Italy, Spain, Germany, England. Do you want well-being? It's not allowed. We don't have. ""
NARRATIVES: 1. Romania is a colony of the West, which prevents it from doing profitable business with China. 2. The West is hypocritical and earns money from exchanges with China, while preventing other countries from doing the same. 3. Chinese investments would be extremely advantageous for Romania and would allow it to put its infrastructure back on its feet. 4. Chinese investments have brought great benefits to the states in the region.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: The investments made by China in the Balkan area in the infrastructure development sector have caused various reactions. On the one hand, they were praised, but in general these investments created huge debts that these states will pay for many years to come.
The largest outlet for Chinese investments was Serbia, a state that on the one hand wants privileged relations with Russia and China, but at the same time, declaratively, says that it wants to integrate into the European Union. Montenegro almost reached the brink of bankruptcy because of a highway whose construction it entrusted to Chinese companies.
Such Chinese investments have generally caught on in states with a pronounced degree of corruption among the authorities in the Balkans. Under the slogan of development, China aims to rebuild the Silk Road in order to have as much access to European markets as possible and to pour its enormous accumulated capital into investments through which it can politically control the states that receive such ""help"" from its side.
The pro-Western governments of Romania after the government of Ponta and Dragnea successively blocked the potential Chinese investments that the two brought to Romania. The last ones in this area are those of the Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant reactors from 2019. Then, Romania broke a prior agreement with China for the refurbishment of the reactors and signed a new agreement with the USA.
Mirel Palada, former advisor to Victor Ponta, is a promoter of China in Romania, just like his former boss, prime minister and PSD leader.
The narrative that Romania is a colony in front of the West is one of the main theses of the Russian propaganda explained both by Veridica.ro and by the show ""Breaking Fake News"" broadcast by TVR Moldova.
OBJECTIVE: Promoting the idea that business with China will be able to develop Romania, but that the authorities in Bucharest kick such opportunities.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: First of all, there is a very clear example in the case of Montenegro, which accessed Chinese loans for the construction of an extremely expensive highway in 2014. The borrowed amount reached about one billion dollars, a debt that brought the state to a step of insolvency.
Montenegro paid almost 20 million euros for each kilometer of the 44 in total, making it one of the highest prices in the world for one kilometer of highway.
In July 2021, due to the inability to pay and with an external debt of 4.33 billion euros or 103% of GDP, the EU helped Montenegro contract the amount of 27.79 million euros from four international European banks to repay the debt to China.
There is even a concept in international relations for what China does - ""debt-trap diplomacy"", through which some states try to obtain political leverage through loans and investments that at first glance seem advantageous, but in fact transform captive countries that fall into this trap.
The ""Belt and Road"" initiative only represents the promotion of China's economic and geopolitical interests in the region. Experts say that the model promoted for the development of infrastructure in the area is based on corruption and aggressive expansion.
Moreover, China has shown an increased interest in taking over various businesses in Europe hit by the pandemic crisis. Last but not least, China wants to expand its influence in the Balkans area and the land and naval routes in the Balkans region in order to compete more commercially with the EU and the USA in the region.
No one forbade Romania, or anyone else, to have commercial relations with Beijing; China is an extremely important commercial partner for the EU, of which Romania is a part, and the USA, with which it is allied. However, alarm signals were raised regarding China's commercial practices (including technology theft, market flooding, etc.), and dependence on it. A separate chapter is the implementation of 5G technology, due to its strategic importance and amid suspicions that it can be used for espionage by Beijing through its companies.

The false narrative is promoted by the leader from Minsk, Aleksandr Lukasenko.
NEWS: ""The reasons for the immigrant crisis at the border were the EU's refusal to build refugee camps, but also the sanctions,"" Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukasenko told RIA Novosti.
He recalled that there was a readmission agreement between Belarus and the EU and according to it, if migrants entered the EU from the Belarusian territory, Minsk was to receive them back and place them in refugee camps [built in] Belarus.
""They had to build camps. And they started to build and then they stopped. And I stopped taking refugees from there,"" said Lukasenko.
Lukasenko also stated that the European Union was the one that terminated the readmission agreement and now he no longer wants to discuss this topic. Then, according to Lukasenko, the sanctions against Belarus began"". NARRATIVE: The EU caused the migrant crisis, after terminating the readmission agreement with Belarus and imposing sanctions on this country.
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Relations between the EU and Belarus have seen many rough edges over time due to the abuses committed by Aleksandr Lukasenko, an authoritarian leader in power since 1994 and described as ""Europe's last dictator"". In August 2020, Lukasenko won a new term as president following the presidential election, but the opposition and Western capitals denounced the vote. A wave of protests followed, many of which were brutally repressed by the Minsk regime, and the EU also imposed sanctions. Aleksandr Lukasenko responded by approaching - even more so from Moscow, which remained practically the only significant partner of the country. Recently, Lukasenko has been accused by a number of EU member states of being used by Russia to generate a new migration crisis directed against the West. The leaders from Minsk and Moscow have met several times to discuss the establishment of a new union of states, created at the pleasure of the Kremlin, but also about common visions in foreign policy.
The regime in Minsk would even have established/tolerated a real system through which migrants from the Middle East (Iraq, Syria, Yemen) and Afghanistan were brought to Minsk and transported from there to the border. According to some video recordings on social networks, the Belarusian security forces even assisted the migrants - and in some cases forced them - to cross into Lithuania and Poland. The Belarusian authorities are obliged not to allow crossing the border to those who cannot prove how they entered the state territory and for what purpose they are going to other countries, but both the Russian and the Belarusian press write that Minsk's actions correspond to the letter of international law. Veridica recently dismantled a false narrative, launched even by the head of the MAE in Moscow, Sergey Lavrov, who declared that asking President Aleksandr Lukasenko and his law enforcement structures to stop this process ""does not correspond to the principles of international law, especially the humanitarian one"". Also, Veridica analyzed in an editorial how the refugee crisis on the border between Belarus and its neighbors is based on new tactics in Russia's hybrid arsenal by cynically using an ally.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative is to demonstrate to the public opinion in Belarus, Russia and other states with important Russian-speaking communities that Brussels generated the migrant crisis and is responsible for it. It is also aimed at undermining the image of the EU, which, through the values ​​it promotes and its prosperity, is in antithesis to the authoritarian regimes and economic models in countries like Belarus and Russia.
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE: In reality, the EU has not made any commitment to build camps for immigrants on the territory of Belarus, but only to finance some projects carried out by Minsk. Aleksandr Lukasenko refers to some programs with non-refundable financing intended for Belarusian beneficiaries to strengthen the infrastructure and security at the border between Belarus and the EU. In 2007, the EU allocated 7 million euros to Belarus for the construction of camps for illegal immigrants in the context of procedures for simplifying the visa regime. Also, according to Deutsche Welle, within the Joint Operational Program of the EU, around 39 million euros were allocated for the modernization of the border infrastructure. Lukasenko claims that the EU stopped building camps for refugees, but Brussels did not even deal with such activities in Belarus.
Moreover, Minsk would have received European money and would have spent it for other purposes. This was confirmed this June even by the Minister of Foreign Affairs from Minsk, Vladimir Makei, who communicated that the European money will be spent for other purposes, for the good of ""the people"". Therefore, Lukasenko's statement about the EU which, it started to build ""camps and then ""stopped"" it misinforms the public opinion. In reality, Belarus is the one that did not honor its commitments regarding the modernization of the border infrastructure.
The thesis of the leader from Minsk according to which the EU abandoned Belarus and terminated the readmission agreement is also false. Even the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, in a press release dated June 28, 2021, published by the Belta Agency from Minsk, said that Minsk initiated the termination of the agreement with the EU, the procedure completed in October.
Lukasenko's statements can also be analyzed as a reply intended for the domestic consumer of information to the statement of the Western countries in the UN Security Council, which condemned in mid-November the wave of illegal migration fueled by the authoritarian regime in Belarus. Russia denied any involvement in the migrant crisis and urged Westerners to restore a communication channel with Minsk. Also in November, the Polish Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, accused the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, of being the sponsor of the wave of illegal migrants trying to enter Poland with the support of the authoritarian regime in neighboring Belarus. Migrants from the Middle East are brought by plane to Belarus and used as human shields, to destabilize the situation in Poland and the entire European Union, said the head of the government in Warsaw.

[...],,If our republic continues to follow the West and renounces the interests of its own people in favor of others, a similar crisis awaits it""
NARRATIVE/NARRATIVES: 1. The West is to blame for the problems of the Eastern European states (from the ex-Soviet space), which face territorial conflicts. 2. The pro-European path chosen by the citizens of the Republic of Moldova and promoted by the current government in Chisinau is a harmful one
CONTEXT/LOCAL ETHOS: Following the presidential elections in November 2020 and the parliamentary elections in July 2021, the representatives of the Action and Solidarity Party, a group that opts for the European integration of the Republic of Moldova, came to power in the Republic of Moldova.
The Republic of Moldova launched the process of rapprochement with the EU at the beginning of the 2000s, but there have been regressions and periodic stagnations due to corrupt governments and those of the center-left, favorable to rapprochement with Russia. However, in 2014, Chisinau signed the Association Agreement, which also includes the free trade agreement, and obtained the liberalized visa regime for its citizens, being the first state in the Eastern Partnership in this regard.
The European Union is also the main external financial supporter of the Republic of Moldova, a new assistance package worth 600 million euros has already been approved for the period 2021-2024.
However, some political forces, led by the Socialist Party led by former president Igor Dodon, but also part of the population, especially the Russian-speaking ethnic minorities, opt for the reorientation of foreign policy towards Russia. These steps are also promoted by the press affiliated with the Kremlin or the socialists.
The Republic of Moldova, like all the member states of the Eastern Partnership, also faces a territorial problem, caused by the separatist region known as Transnistria, supported and financed directly and indirectly by Moscow. Soviet-era ammunition and weaponry are stored here, guarded by a Russian military contingent, and Moscow refuses to fulfill its international commitments to withdraw them, conditional on the settlement of the conflict.
OBJECTIVE: To present the West as guilty of the economic and territorial problems faced by the Republic of Moldova and to determine the diversion of the European course chosen by the citizens
WHY THE NARRATIVE IS FALSE/THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: As in most of the member states of the Eastern Partnership, the territorial problem of the Republic of Moldova appeared with the breakup of the former USSR and was caused by the artificial demarcation of borders during the Soviet period.
The separatist regime from Tiraspol would not have survived without direct and indirect political and economic support from the Kremlin. Moscow is pumping money into the region. At the same time, the regime is maintained also due to the fact that they do not pay for the gas consumed, including the power plant from Cuciurgan. This, in turn, sells most of the electricity consumed on the right side of the Dniester.
Moscow opposes the withdrawal of its troops and ammunition, thus ensuring the perpetuation of the status quo.
By contrast, the Baltic states, which are members of the EU and NATO, have a much higher level of life and safety than the other ex-Soviet countries, which have oscillated during the last 30 years between East and West, or remained in the sphere the influence of Russia.
Despite the praise of Russia by certain politicians and media institutions, the majority of Moldovan citizens choose to go abroad to the West and support the European integration of the Republic of Moldova.

NEWS: ""At the invitation of the leadership of the party ""Edinaia Rossia"" (""United Russia""), the president of the PSRM, Igor Dodon, participated in the video conference dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the founding of the party. Delegates from approximately 30 countries participated in the event. In his speech, the president of the PSRM indicated one of the most current problems facing the Republic of Moldova and other countries in the post-Soviet space: foreign interference and the defense of sovereignty. The socialist leader noted that during the 2020 presidential elections and this summer's parliamentary elections, the US and EU representatives were openly involved in the internal affairs of our country. Thus, the US ambassador and the head of the EU Delegation visited the force structures of our state, the CEC and the Audiovisual Council, and during the current regime, de facto, a direct external administration was established in Moldova. The President of the PSRM emphasized that the common task of our countries, which are fighting for the preservation of sovereignty, is unity. ""I am convinced that only through joint efforts, we will be able to protect our countries, independence and sovereignty"", declared Igor Dodon. We remind you that in 2017, the Party of Socialists from the Republic of Moldova and ""United Russia"" signed a Cooperation Agreement. NARRATIVES: 1. The Republic of Moldova is ruled by external forces and it must defend its sovereignty. 2. The USA and the EU got involved in the electoral campaign and the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova. 3. With the assumption of power by PAS, a direct external administration was established in Moldova.
CONTEXT: The Republic of Moldova is a post-Soviet state, in which the Russian influence is very strong and is maintained including by supporting some political parties and the Russian-language media. The Party of Socialists, led by Igor Dodon, promotes a policy of as close as possible to the Russian Federation. The PSRM leader, who was also president of the Republic of Moldova, was even accused of collaborating with the Russian special services, under the pseudonym Kremlinovici. The PSRM, which had the largest group of deputies in the Parliament, held the Presidency and the Government, lost power after Igor Dodon lost his second term as president in the November 2020 elections, and his party accumulated only 27% of the votes in the July 2011 parliamentary elections.
The majority of the population of the Republic of Moldova, a large number of whom also hold Romanian citizenship, see their future in the European Union. Many Moldovan citizens work in EU countries, and recently, young people prefer to study in Romania and EU countries. The last elections in the Republic of Moldova were won by PAS, a pro-European party, founded by president Maia Sandu.
PSRM leader Igor Dodon, former president of the Republic of Moldova, lost his popularity in front of the electorate in the Republic of Moldova, but also his credibility in front of his financiers and supporters from the Russian Federation. Against this background, he withdrew from Parliament and announced that he would also leave the leadership of the party.
OBJECTIVE: The narratives aim to discredit the new administration and scare the population that the state of the Republic of Moldova will disappear from the map. The statement made by Igor Dodon during the video conference organized by Edinaia Rossia is also an attempt by him to convince his supporters in Russia that he will be able to continue leading the main pro-Russian party in the Republic of Moldova.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The ""mixture"" of the West has been the obsession of the Putin regime for years, which denounced the so-called color revolutions, the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of some ex-Soviet republics and the support of civil society through various programs and grants, stating that these are only actions of the West aimed at enshrining Russia and bringing it under political control.
The statement made by Igor Dodon during the video conference organized by Edinaia Rossia is part of the geopolitical campaign of the Russian Federation which aims to keep the Republic of Moldova in its sphere of influence. The main narratives promoted by the PSRM are directed against the West and Romania, the European and American ambassadors, the non-governmental organizations. On the other hand, in both electoral campaigns, the presidential one last year and the parliamentary one this summer, the Russian authorities at the highest level made declarations of support for Igor Dodon and PSRM and accused the American and EU embassies in Chisinau of interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova.
The EU delegation emphasized that it acts in the Republic of Moldova in strict accordance with its mandate and precisely respecting the independence and sovereignty of the state. During the electoral campaign, the representatives of the US Embassy in Chisinau and the EU Delegation were accredited by the CEC as observers, and the meetings held by the heads of diplomatic missions were within the scope of the electoral legislation and in accordance with the electoral observer status.
OFFICIAL REACTIONS: ""The European Union supports the Republic of Moldova on the basis of the signed Association Agreement, in the spirit of cooperation and established partnership. The Delegation of the European Union follows the internal processes carefully and based on the compatibility of the local legislation with the international commitments assumed by the Republic of Moldova, including those vis-à-vis the European Union, in strict accordance with its mandate and precisely respecting the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova"", is the reaction of the EU Delegation to Replica Media request.

Dalli wrote in the presentation of the guide that every European citizen, ""regardless of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or creed, disability, age or sexual orientation"" must be valued and recognized, this being the essence of the ""Unity in Diversity"" principle. The recommendations were addressed to EU officials and concerned their official communication - in press materials, conferences, speeches, posts on social media, etc.
The recommendations cover a wide range of topics - for example, European officials are told that they should not use the term ""European"" as a synonym for those who live in the EU, because citizens of countries such as Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina are also Europeans. , Albania, etc. Similarly, it is recommended that when EU countries are used as examples, officials should not limit themselves to old or high-weight members, such as France and Germany: ""No matter if you are in Berlin, Rome or Paris ""European legislation protects you"" should be worded as ""Irrespective of whether you are in Berlin, Budapest or Vilnius, European legislation protects you"".
These principles are also valid for issues related to gender, sexual orientation, etc.
Some of the document's recommendations are reminiscent of the ideas behind the so-called current ""cancel culture"", which is reminiscent of the older ""political correctness"" and is strongly contested by its opponents from the right of the political establishment. They also denounce the ""cancel culture"" in the campaign they are running against the left-wing opponents.
It should also be noted that, for several years, Russia has been involved in a campaign of fake news and disinformation aimed at undermining and calling into question the values ​​that are the basis of the EU. This is cataloged as ""Gayropa"", a space of homosexuals and pedophilia, where Christian and family values ​​are destroyed, and foreigners coming from outside - migrants and refugees - destroy Christian, cultural and even ethnic identity. The idea of ​​""cancellation"" "" of Christmas, for example, fits both the specific discourse of the radical right and that of Russian propaganda.
The conclusion of the ActiveNews article - ,,[in] today's Europe, it is best to keep your mouth shut. Or leave."" - it is also in the line of a discourse promoted by radical sovereignists and the Russian extreme right: the European construction must be abandoned (obviously for the sake of freedom and traditional values).
OBJECTIVE: Promoting narratives regarding a so-called assault on European ""identity"".
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The Guide does not try to impose anything on EU citizens - it is strictly about the communication of the officials, and its purpose is to ensure that this communication does not hurt the feelings of any minority or any EU citizen. There is no question of banning some names, but only recommending the use of a wider palette, which reflects European diversity. No Christmas is ""cancelled"", but European officials are only told not to start from the premise that all those they address are Christians and their sensitivities must be taken into account; similarly, officials are told that they must not assume that the recipients of the messages are white, married or heterosexual. It does not ""become an offense to talk about the colonization of the planet Mars"" or to use the phrase ""human settlements on Mars"", but officials are only recommended to take into account the fact that such terms can have negative connotations (in the first case we are talking about the descendants of native populations from colonized regions, in the second the English term ""settlement"" which has a political charge including - but not only - in the context of the conflict in Middle east).
For now, the recommendations are not even applied at the level of European officials: after the document was denounced by Il Giornale and vehemently criticized by right-wing politicians, including the former President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, and the former Prime Minister of Rome, Silvio Berlusconi, The commission withdrew it. Moreover, Helena Dalli distanced herself from this document, stating that ""it is not a mature document and it does not respect all the quality standards of the Commission"". Publication / Media:

The beneficiaries of the fear would be the so-called Big Pharma companies.
NEWS: ""Panic must be maintained day by day, hour by hour and in proportion to the meal. Dictatorship is not maintained with humiliation, but with terror. Don't leave the poor man a moment of peace. Not a trace of reflection. Not a moment of joy. Especially on the eve of the Holidays. The horror series with which the population of the planet is terrified continues unabated. A new successful episode was released: Omicron [...] Faced with the new threat, Europe and America barricade themselves in despair [...] the normality that we keep being told is contained in the vaccine and does not appear in the prospectus is not even ""normal"" [...] Overnight, when the world hadn't even heard of the new strain, the anti-Omicron vaccine was also taken out of service. Obviously, by Bill Gates. It's decided, science is starting to look more and more with illusionism [...] But what can be deduced after almost two years of the pandemic is that the expert lives next to the politician's house. Especially the left one. And feeds on crumbs from Big Pharma. The more progressive the politician is and the bigger the crumbs, the more expert the expert is.""
NARRATIVES: 1. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 was invented by the global occult and Big Pharma to terrorize the population on the eve of the holidays and impose global dictatorship. 2. Bill Gates wants to impose global vaccination. 3. The experts would, in fact, be in the service of left-wing politicians (allusion to ""sexo-Marxists"") and Big Pharma companies.
LOCAL CONTEXT/ETHOS: The most recent strain of the SARS-CoV 2 virus has determined dozens of states to impose travel restrictions at least until the medical elucidation of the risks related to it.
On November 28, Israel completely closed its borders to all foreigners in an attempt to limit the spread of the new Omicron strain. Also, the USA and Canada have closed their borders to those coming from South Africa, the place where the new strain was discovered. Likewise, Great Britain announced new measures against the spread of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
Japan announced it was closing its borders to new foreign visitors from Tuesday, while Australia halted its long-awaited plan to ease border restrictions.
Last but not least, the European Commission proposed on November 26 the suspension of flights from and to the EU with South Africa. Until December 1, the number of countries that had announced restrictions was over 50.
The Romanian authorities are also considering this new strain. The coordinator of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, Valeriu Gheorghita, stated on Antena 3 that what is known at this time is that Omicron is a much more aggressive and contagious variant.
OBJECTIVE: To promote conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. Inducing skepticism and a state of relaxation regarding the new strain.
WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE FALSE: The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the Omicron strain presents a high risk of infection worldwide, and this opinion is shared by many experts from all over the world.
The variant could lead to serious consequences in some regions, according to the WHO. The head of the organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, renewed a call for a global push to get vaccines to poorer nations and added that the COVID-19 virus ""is not finished with us"", reports the BBC.
The article is based on the classic narratives that reject the opinion of the scientific community regarding the coronavirus and challenge the measures taken to combat it. These narratives, which appeared with the pandemic, primarily originate from Russia, but some are also invented/promoted by China or the extreme right, especially the one in the United States.
The editorial on Active News quotes the same experts from South Africa - Barry Schoub and Angelique Coetzee - who said that the Omicron demonstration is still ""moderate"", just like Russia Today.
A peculiarity, however, is the truncated citation of these experts who, in addition to the fact that they speak of ""moderate manifestations"", draw attention to the fact that these are the ""first days"" and we must wait and see to better understand the real danger they represent the new strain"".
The author partially contradicts himself. If in the first part he says that it is about the rapacity of Big Pharma to sell vaccines, then the ""world occult"" reorients itself, because it can no longer invent new waves, towards controlling the population through green certificates.
Everything is likened to Nazism and communism, which would be exercised in a modern form by states that impose restrictions in various forms. These themes are recurrent in the ranks of Russian propaganda that feeds the rhetoric of anti-vaxxers.
